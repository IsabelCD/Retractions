We collected the information for i) the first author’s country; ii) the journal name where the study was published; iii) the impact factor of the journal; iv) the main objective of the study; v) methods including population, intervention, study design, and outcomes; and vi) results and conclusions. We collected complete information from the retraction notes published by the journals and the number of publications/retractions related to non-COVID-19 clinical trials published simultaneously. We also included the Altmetric index for the clinical trials and the retraction notes about COVID-19 to compare the accessibility to both studies’ indexes. The retraction of clinical trials occurred in four countries (one in Lebanon, one in India, one in Brazil, and five in Egypt) and six journals (one in Viruses, one in Archives of Virology, one in Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy, one in Frontiers in Medicine, two in Scientific Reports, and two in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene). Eight drugs were tested (Ivermectin, Vitamin D, Proxalutamide, Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesevir, Favipiravir, and Sofosbuvir + Daclatasvir) in the studies. One of the retractions was suggested by the authors due to an error in the statistical analysis, which compromised their results and conclusions. Also, the methods, mainly the allocation, were not well conducted in the two studies, and the studies were retracted. In addition, the studies performed by Dabbous et al. presented several issues, mainly including several raw datasets that did not prove their findings. Moreover, two studies were retracted due to data overlap and copying. Significant concerns were raised about the integrity of the data and reported results in another article. We identified a higher Altmetric index for the original studies, proving that the retracted studies were accessed more than the retraction notes. Interestingly, the impact of the original articles is much higher than their retraction notes. The different Altmetric indexes show that possibly people who read those retracted articles are not reading their retraction notes and are unaware of the erroneous information they share. COVID-19- related clinical trials were ~two-time times more retracted than the other clinical trials performed during the same time. © 2023 by the authors.","clinical trial; mortality; pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; science","Brazil; Egypt; India; Lebanon; anticoronavirus agent; daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin; pruxelutamide; remdesevir; unclassified drug; vitamin D; COVID-19; disease transmission; disease treatment; health care; mortality; public health; access to information; analytical error; Article; Brazil; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; data error; Egypt; human; India; information source; Lebanon; mortality; outcome assessment; pandemic; retraction notice; study design","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2021/08437-5)","This research was funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo Research Foundation, grant number 2021/08437-5).","Carvalho T., Lima T., Melani V., Mendes M., Pereira L., Marson F.A.L., The scientific production during 2009 swine flu pandemic and 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Pulmonology, 26, pp. 340-345, (2020); Valencise F.E., Boschiero M.N., Palamim C.V.C., Marson F.A.L., The COVID-19 impact on the scientific production on the 25 main death causes according to world region, Pulmonology, 28, pp. 1-3, (2022); Yeo-Teh N.S.L., Tang B.L., An alarming retraction rate for scientific publications on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Account.

This study systematically reviews retracted publications in the spine surgery literature. Methods: A search of PubMed MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Retraction Watch, and the independent websites of 15 spine surgery-related journals from inception to September of 2022 was performed without language restrictions. PRISMA guidelines were followed with title/abstract screening, and full-text screening was conducted independently and in duplicate by two reviewers. Study characteristics and bibliometric information for each publication was extracted. Results: Of 250 studies collected from the search, 65 met the inclusion criteria. The most common reason for retraction was data error (n = 15, 21.13%), followed by plagiarism (n = 14, 19.72%) and submission to another journal (n = 14, 19.72%). Most studies pertained to degenerative pathologies of the spine (n = 32, 80.00%). Most articles had no indication of retraction in their manuscript (n = 24, 36.92%), while others had a watermark or notice at the beginning of the article. The median number of citations per retracted publication was 10.0 (IQR 3–29), and the median 4-year impact factor of the journals was 5.05 (IQR 3.20–6.50). On multivariable linear regression, the difference in years from publication to retraction (p = 0.0343, β = 6.56, 95% CI 0.50–12.62) and the journal 4-year impact factor (p = 0.0029, β = 7.47, 95% CI 2.66–12.28) were positively associated with the total number of citations per retracted publication. Most articles originated from China (n = 30, 46.15%) followed by the United States (n = 12, 18.46%) and Germany (n = 3, 4.62%). The most common study design was retrospective cohort studies (n = 14, 21.54%). Conclusions: The retraction of publications has increased in recent years in spine surgery. Researchers consulting this body of literature should remain vigilant. Institutions and journals should collaborate to increase publication transparency and scientific integrity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data error; Ethics; Fraud; Plagiarism; Publication retraction; Spine surgery","bibliometrics; China; cohort analysis; data error; Embase; ethics; fraud; Germany; human; human experiment; language; linear regression analysis; Medline; plagiarism; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; retraction notice; retrospective study; review; spine surgery; systematic review; United States","","","Bolland M.J., Grey A., Avenell A., Citation of retracted publications: a challenging problem, Account Res, 29, pp. 18-25, (2022); Fang F.C., Casadevall A., Retracted science and the retraction index, Infect Immun, 79, pp. 3855-3859, (2011); World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, Bull World Health Organ, 310, pp. 2191-2194, (2013); Gupta A., Fraud and misconduct in clinical research: a concern, Perspect Clin Res, 4, pp. 144-147, (2013); Wager E., Barbour V., Yentis S., Kleinert S., Retractions: guidance from the committee on publication ethics, J Crit Care, 24, pp. 620-622, (2009); Gaudino M., Robinson N.B., Audisio K., Et al., Trends and characteristics of retracted articles in the biomedical literature, 1971 to 2020, JAMA Intern Med, 181, pp. 1118-1121, (2021); Budd J.M., Sievert M., Schultz T.R., Phenomena of retraction: reasons for retraction and citations to the publications, JAMA, 280, (1998); Wager E., Williams P., Why and how do journals retract articles?

Methods: Using the Retraction Watch Database, we conducted a cross-sectional study for retracted publications categorized as ‘Infectious Disease’ or ‘Microbiology’ until June 30 2022. We included publications for which citation information was available through the Web of Science database. Study characteristics, retraction trends and number of citations before and after the retraction year were analysed. Results: Overall, 1004 retracted publications were included, retracted between August 1968 and June 2022. The number of retractions climbed through the years, peaking in 2020–2021. A total of 614 retractions originated from USA, China, and India, of total 183 736 PubMed publications from these countries. Overall, 378 (38%) were retracted because of errors; 182 (18%) because of plagiarism; and 142 (14%) because of falsification/fabrication. Specific reasons included ‘concerns/issues about data’ (158, 16%); ‘duplication of image’ (127, 13%); and ‘unreliable results’ (116, 12%). Of the 347 retractions during 2020 to June 2022, 91 (26%) were COVID-19 related. Fifty of 895 (5.6%) first authors had two retracted papers, and 14 (1.6%) had ≥2 retractions. Of 824 publications cited at least once, 466 (57%) were cited more often after retraction. Discussion: Retractions of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology publications are increasing. Concerning reasons such as plagiarism, falsification/fabrication and errors are not uncommon. Nonetheless, these publications continue to be commonly cited after being retracted. © 2023 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases","Clinical microbiology; Infectious diseases; Methodology; Retraction; Scientific misconduct","","Arthur Carter Journalism Institute, New York University","We thank Ivan Oransky and Alison Abritis (the Retraction Watch, The Center for Scientific Integrity, and the Arthur Carter Journalism Institute, New York University, New York) for their support in performing this manuscript and data sharing.","COPE's Retraction guidelines for advice and guidance for editors, (2019); The Retraction Watch Database.

Previous reviews on retracted publications in obstetrics and gynecology have identified “article duplication,” “plagiarism,” and “fabricated results” as the main reasons for retraction. However, the extent of retracted articles in the literature on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to assess the number and characteristics of retracted articles in the field of MAR. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for this study. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the PubMed database from 1993 to February 2023, limited to English articles and including all 283 terms from the International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care. To identify retracted studies, a specific query combining the 283 terms from the glossary with a retraction-related keyword was used. Only studies focused on MAR and involving human subjects were included. Results: The electronic search yielded a total of 523,067 records in the field of infertility and fertility care. Among these, a total of 2,458 records were identified as retracted. The citation retraction rate was found to be 0.47% (2,458/523,067; 95%CI 0.45–0.49), and the citation retraction rate for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was 0.20% (93/45,616; 95%CI 0.16–0.25). A total of 39 retracted articles specifically related to MAR were identified. Among these, 41.0% were RCTs (n = 16), 15.4% were reviews (n = 6), and 10.3% were retrospective studies (n = 4) or prospective studies (n = 4). Most of the retractions occurred shortly after publication, with “plagiarism” being the most common reason for retraction, followed by “duplicate publication.” Discussion: The issue of retraction exists within the field of infertility and fertility care, including MAR. Our findings indicate that scientific misconduct, particularly plagiarism and duplicate publication, are the primary causes of retraction in MAR. Despite finding that the proportion of retracted citations is low, promoting scientific integrity should be a priority. The consequences of article retractions have significant implications for patient care and the scientific community. Hence, it is crucial to prioritize thorough screening of manuscripts before publication to maintain research integrity.

Methods: The Retraction Watch database was retrieved for retracted papers in the field of global liver disease published by Chinese scholars from March 1, 2008 to January 28, 2021. The regional distribution, source journals, reasons for retraction, publication and retraction times, and others were analyzed. Results: A total of 101 retracted papers that were distributed across 21 provinces/cities were retrieved. Zhejiang area (n = 17) had the most retracted papers, followed by Shanghai (n = 14), and Beijing (n = 11). The vast majority were research papers (n = 95). The journal PLoS One had the highest number of retracted papers. In terms of time distribution, 2019 (n = 36) had the most retracted papers. 23 papers, accounting for 8.3% of all retractions, were retracted owing to journal or publisher concerns. Liver cancer (34%), liver transplantation (16%), hepatitis (14%), and others were the main areas of retracted papers. Conclusion: Chinese scholars have a large number of retracted articles in the field of global liver diseases. A journal or publisher chooses to retract a manuscript after investigating and discovering more flawed problems, which, however, require further support, revision, and supervision from the editorial and academic circles.","Liver; Liver disease; Retraction papers; Retraction Watch Database","Biomedical Research; China; Humans; Liver Diseases; Scientific Misconduct; China; human; liver disease; medical research; scientific misconduct","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","10073418","","","36948856","Chinese","Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150796768"

Retraction is an important mechanism for correcting the literature and protecting its integrity. Within the medical literature, the continued citation of retracted publications occurs for a variety of reasons. Recent evidence suggests that systematic reviews and meta-analyses often unwittingly cite retracted publications which, at least in some cases, may significantly impact quantitative effect estimates in meta-analyses. There is strong evidence that authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses may be unaware of the retracted status of publications and treat them as if they are not retracted. These problems are difficult to address for several reasons: identifying retracted publications is important but logistically challenging; publications may be retracted while a review is in preparation or in press and problems with a publication may also be discovered after the evidence synthesis is published. We propose a set of concrete actions that stakeholders (eg, scientists, peer-reviewers, journal editors) might take in the near-term, and that research funders, citation management systems, and databases and search engines might take in the longer term to limit the impact of retracted primary studies on evidence syntheses. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Data were retrieved from Scopus (n = 840). The Retraction Watch database was used to identify the reasons for retraction and the time that elapsed from publication to retraction. The findings showed that intentional errors were the most prevalent reasons for retraction. China (438), the United States (130), and India (51) have the largest share of retractions. These retracted publications were cited 5,659 times in other research publications, of which 1,559 citations occurred after the retraction, which should raise concern. These retracted papers were also shared in online platforms, mainly on Twitter and by members of the general public. We recommend that the early detection of retracted papers may help to reduce the rate of citation and sharing of these publications, and minimize their negative impact. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","post-retraction citations; research integrity; Retractions; scientific misconduct","","","","Bar-Ilan J., Halevi G., Post Retraction Citations in Context: A Case Study, Scientometrics, 113, 1, pp. 547-565, (2017); Bennett C., Chambers L.M., Al-Hafez L., Michener C.M., Falcone T., Yao M., Berghella V., Retracted Articles in the Obstetrics Literature: Lessons from the Past to Change the Future, American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM, 2, 4, pp. 100201-100207, (2020); Berenbaum M.R., On Zombies, Struldbrugs, and Other Horrors of the Scientific Literature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 118, 32, pp. 1-3, (2021); Bhatt B., A Multi-Perspective Analysis of Retractions in Life Sciences, Scientometrics, 126, 5, pp. 4039-4054, (2021); Bolboaca S.D., Buhai D.-V., Aluas M., Bulboaca A.E., Glanzel W., Post Retraction Citations Among Manuscripts Reporting a Radiology-Imaging Diagnostic Method, PLOS ONE, 14, 6, pp. 1-14, (2019); Bornemann-Cimenti H., Szilagyi I.S., Sandner-Kiesling A., A Perpetuation of Retracted Publications Using the Example of the Scott S.

That is why the objective of the study focused on evaluating the trends in the dynamics of retractions and determining existing patterns among the variables analyzed. A bibliometric analysis of articles associated with the pandemic was carried out. The trends and dynamics of 103 retracted manuscripts from December 2019 to June 2021 were evaluated. This evidenced an inspiring association with shorter review time, as well as with manuscripts published in Q1 and Q2 journals of Scimago Journal Rank. Likewise, the number of retracted articles decreased nine months after the declaration of a pandemic. Although the pandemic positively impacted on the process of disseminating scientific information, editorial policies should include control mechanisms that persuade authors about unethical behavior. © 2023, Centro Nacional de Informacion de Ciencias Medicas.

In order to assess this phenomenon, the Job Anxiety Scale (JAS) is one of the instruments available. It consists of 70 items that are clustered in 14 subscales and five dimensions. This manuscript is a revised version of a retracted article that analyzed the properties of a short version of the JAS. Rather than shortening the scale, the authors of the JAS recommend to further assess the scale in its current state without modification of the factor structure. Hence, the aim of this paper is to assess the psychometric properties of the original JAS. Methods: The sample consists of 991 – mostly psychosomatic – patients from two different clinics. We applied methods of factor analysis and bivariate correlations to explore and test factor structure and the nomological net of related constructs. Results: The Job Anxiety Scale evinced satisfactory psychometric properties. We found very high internal consistency, and invariance across participant age. It displayed good discriminant validity and we found the expected pattern of convergent correlations. However, the model fit is not convincing. Conclusion: With the Job Anxiety Scale, researchers can assess job related worries in a reliable manner. The questionnaire is particularly useful in large-scale surveys, in therapy or work-related contexts. However, the scale could be modified in order to aim for a better fit and assess job related anxiety in a more efficient way.
