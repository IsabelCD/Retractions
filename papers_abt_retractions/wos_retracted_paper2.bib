Abstract = {Flexible humidity sensors with ultrafast response are great importance
   in the promising wearable devices. In this paper, a novel nanocomposite
   of tin disulfide/graphene oxide nanoflower (SnS2/GO) was first
   synthesized for constructing humidity sensors. The nanostructural,
   morphological and compositional properties of the SnS2/GO hybrid were
   characterized by XRD, XPS, FT-IR, SEM, TEM and EDS. The humidity
   experiment found that SnS2/GO (in the wt\% ratio of 1:2.5) has the most
   excellent response. The humidity sensing results revealed the SnS2/GO
   film sensor has ultrahigh response, negligible hysteresis, favorable
   reversibility and ultrafast response/recovery behavior, which outstrips
   the individual SnS2 or GO film sensor. The potential mechanism of water
   molecule adsorption was revealed, and the complex impedance spectroscopy
   and Bode diagrams were used to further explain the sensing mechanisms of
   the SnS2/GO composite. Moreover, the impedance changes caused by the
   bending effect, human respiration and fingertip approaching/retracting
   behavior were investigated, which demonstrate a great potential of the
   SnS2/GO sensor in humidity sensing for wearable applications.},

Abstract = {End-effectors require careful design considerations to be able to
   successfully hold and use power tools while maintaining the ability to
   also grasp a wide range of other objects. This paper describes the
   design of an. end effector for a humanoid robot built for disaster
   response scenarios. The end effector is comprised of two independently
   actuated fingers with two opposing stationary rigid hollow pylons built
   to allow the pinching of objects and to provide protection for the
   opposing fingers when retracted and not in use. Each finger has two
   degrees of freedom (DOE) and is actuated with one servo motor through
   the use of an underactuated four bar linkage. Using only two fingers and
   two actuators the end-effector has the ability to hold a power tool
   while also being able to simultaneously actuate the trigger of the tool
   independently. The combination of compliant fingers and rigid pylons
   along with the careful design of the palm structure creates a strong
   robust dexterous end-effort that is simple to control.},

Abstract = {The 3.5-m telescope at the Starfire Optical Range (SOR), operated by the
   Directed Energy Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory,
   Kirtland AFB, NM saw first light in February, 1994 and first operation
   of the adaptive optics in September, 1997. The primary mirror built by
   Steward Observatory Mirror Lab is spun cast borosilicate, actively
   supported and temperature conditioned. The telescope mount was designed
   to smoothly track low-earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites and therefore has
   different features than most telescopes designed for astronomy. The
   protective enclosure retracts vertically, leaving the telescope
   completely exposed, enabling access to rapidly moving targets. The
   telescope feeds a coude laboratory containing steering mirrors,
   deformable mirror, sensors for wave front control and target tracking,
   high resolution cameras, and lasers for beacons and energy projection
   experiments. This paper summarizes recent operating experiences and
   provides lessons learned in terms of thermal conditioning, mount
   control, mirror control, mirror cleaning, optical alignment, and
   satellite tracking. The operation and performance of the tracking and
   higher-order wave front compensation to LEO satellites will be
   presented. Plans for future upgrades will be described.},

Abstract = {This paper details the design, analysis, fabrication, and validation of
   a deployable, atraumatic grasper intended for retraction and
   manipulation tasks in manual and robotic minimally invasive surgical
   (MIS) procedures. Fabricated using a combination of shape deposition
   manufacturing (SDM) and 3D printing, the device (which acts as a
   deployable end-effector for robotic platforms) has the potential to
   reduce the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage by providing a soft,
   compliant interface between delicate tissue structures and the metal
   laparoscopic forceps and graspers that are currently used to manipulate
   and retract these structures on an ad hoc basis. This paper introduces a
   general analytical framework for designing SDM fingers where the desire
   is to predict the shape and the transmission ratio, and this framework
   was used to design a multijointed grasper that relies on geometric
   trapping to manipulate tissue, rather than friction or pinching, to
   provide a safe, stable, adaptive, and conformable means for
   manipulation. Passive structural compliance, coupled with active grip
   force monitoring enabled by embedded pressure sensors, helps to reduce
   the cognitive load on the surgeon. Initial manipulation tasks in a
   simulated environment have demonstrated that the device can be deployed
   though a 15 mm trocar and develop a stable grasp using Intuitive
   Surgical's daVinci robotic platform to deftly manipulate a tissue
   analog.},

Title = {A method to determine lumen volume and collapse degree of pulp fibers by
   using bottleneck effect of mercury porosimetry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {53},
Number = {6},
Pages = {516-519},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {On applying mercury porosimetry to wood blocks or paper sheets, the
   ``bottleneck{''} effect due to pits of fibers occurs and thus lumen
   volume can be determined from the weight increase due to the remaining
   mercury. However, in addition to the mercury in the lumen, some mercury
   drops may also remain in the space between fibers within a paper sheet.
   The mercury between fibers increased with an increase of basis weight.
   Thus, a large number of paper sheets of low basis weight, such as 10
   g.m(-2), should be used to determine the lumen volume of pulp fibers.
   Furthermore, in the case of fibers from mechanical pulp with many open
   cut fibers, mercury can retract from the open lumen such that the
   bottleneck effect due to pits does not occur. Therefore, the degree to
   which fibers are cut should also be considered for lumen volume
   determination. Although quantitative estimation of open cut fibers is
   difficult, the percentage of open cut fibers is quite low for the long
   fiber fraction. Thus, the remaining mercury for the long fiber fraction
   can be adopted as the lumen volume at least for practical purposes.
   Compared with the original lumen volume of the wood, the volumetric
   degree of fiber collapse was also estimated. Plausible values of almost
   100\% for lightly beaten KP and about 85\% for slabwood thermomechanical
   pulp were obtained for the degree of collapse.},

Abstract = {To determine fuel assembly mechanical damping under PWR conditions
   during a postulated seismic event or LOCA, fuel assembly flowing water
   damping tests were needed. Since flowing water damping values are high,
   pluck tests were used in which the fuel assembly was deflected, pluck
   mechanism retracted, and fuel assembly vibration decay observed and
   measured. To allow for the pluck vibration to occur, an oversized flow
   housing was utilized, which allowed additional flow to bypass the fuel
   assembly in the gaps between the assembly and the flow housing walls
   that would otherwise flow through the bundle rodded region. Since a
   direct measurement of the average bundle flow velocity could not be
   made, a method was developed for determining the flowrate through the
   bundle using fuel assembly lift force measurements.
   This paper will present the method for determining the actual flowrate
   that was used in recent testing. The use of custom load cells that were
   designed for this testing to measure the fuel assembly lift force will
   be described in this paper. Additionally, the paper will show how the
   correlation between total test flow and bundle flow was developed from a
   series of flow calibration tests at different hydraulic conditions. This
   correlation was then used to prescribe the loop flow setpoints necessary
   to achieve targeted bundle flow velocities during the pluck test series.},

Abstract = {Objective: It describes and analyzes the theoretical-practical
   incidences of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation,
   including but not limited to the Information Science framework. Besides,
   it aims to outline an understanding of these three concepts based on 16
   arrangements interconnected according to their intentionality.
   Methods: To build discourses and descriptions of the phenomenon of
   misinformation and its derivations, we applied the hermeneutical,
   rhetorical, and phenomenological principles of intentionality as our
   work methods.
   Results: As a result, we present some theoretical incidences to clarify
   these three concepts, in addition to outlining and characterizing,
   according to the intentionality, 16 mis-, dis-, mal- information
   arrangements associated with these three concepts: bias, propaganda,
   retracted papers, conspiracy theories, misleading representation in
   maps, charts and graphics, fake news, clickbait, hoax, satire or parody,
   imposter website, fake reviews, phishing, filter bubbles, and echo
   chambers.
   Conclusions: We highlight that the complexity that permeates the various
   fields in the present situation is due to the difficulty of reaching a
   consensus on the semantic definition of the concepts of information,
   misinformation, and its disambiguations since these concepts have
   various properties.},

Abstract = {In this paper, two kinds of pumice particles with different diameters
   and water absorption rates are employed to substitute the corresponding
   size of river sands by volume fraction, and their effects on the
   hydration characteristics and persistent shrinkage of Ultra-High
   Performance Concrete (UHPC) are investigated. The obtained experimental
   results show that adopting a low dosage of 0.6-1.25 mm saturated pumice
   as the internal curing agent in UHPC can effectively retract the
   persistent shrinkage deformation of concrete without a decrease of
   strength. Heat flow calorimetry results demonstrate that the additional
   water has a retarding effect and promotes the hydration process. X-ray
   Diffraction (XRD) and Differential Thermal Gravimetry (DTG) are utilized
   to quantify the Ca(OH)(2) content in the hardened paste, which can
   confirm that the external moisture could accelerate the early cement
   hydration and secondary hydration of active mineral admixtures. The
   Ca/Si ratio of C S H calculated by the Energy Dispersive Spectrometer
   (EDS) reveals that the incorporation of wet pumice can transform the
   composition and structure of hydration products in its effective area.},

Abstract = {We present a new algorithm that enables a convex shaped robot to explore
   an unknown planar workspace, i.e., an unknown configuration space
   diffeomorphic to SE(2). This new algorithm is based on a new roadmap,
   called the convex hierarchical generalized Voronoi graph (convex-HGVG),
   which is the central contribution of this paper. Since this roadmap is
   defined in terms of workspace distance information which is within line
   of sight of the convex body, we can use this roadmap to direct the robot
   to explore the unknown space. The challenge in defining the roadmap is
   that SE(2), with holes removed from it, does not have, in general, a
   one-dimensional retract. Therefore, we decompose the punctured SE(2)
   into contractible regions in which we define convex generalized Voronoi
   graphs (convex-GVG) and then connect these graphs with additional
   structures called R-edges. The convex-GVG edges and the R-edges together
   form the convex-HGVG. We show that the convex-HGVG is indeed a roadmap
   and then we demonstrate the control laws that a robot can invoke that
   incrementally constructs the roadmap.},

Title = {A Domain-Independent Algorithm for Plan Adaptation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {319-360},
Abstract = {The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and
   plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation -
   modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this
   paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation,
   demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it
   to other adaptation algorithms in the literature.
   Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of
   partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves
   from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by
   adaptation, a library plan an arbitrary node in the plan graph is the
   starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can
   apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative
   planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our
   algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will
   eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it
   will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.},

Abstract = {Cold Metal Transfer (abbreviated CMT) is a welding method that usually
   performed by a welding robot. The CMT machine detects a short circuit
   that sends a signal that retracts the welding filler material, giving
   the weld time to cool before each drop placed. This leaves a smooth weld
   that is stronger than that of a hotter weld. In this paper, the effect
   of arc length correction on the weld bead geometry of AA6061T6 material
   ERER4043 (AlSi5\%) used as filler wire, And various parameters was
   investigated by this method. The thickness of used material was 3.18 mm.
   And, applying the current, (80 A, 90 A, and 100 A). The welding speed
   was used (6, 9, and 12 mm sec(-1)) on above work with Arc Length

Abstract = {A direct drive volume control (DDVC) is applied to fuel injection
   control for marine diesel engine. The DDVC consists of an AC servomotor,
   a fixed-displacement hydraulic pump, and a hydraulic cylinder. The
   hydraulic cylinder pushes a plunger pump and fuel is pressurized. When
   the fuel pressure becomes greater than injection pressure, fuel is
   injected to a combustion chamber. A brief introduction of the DDVC is
   described first in this paper referring to conventional fuel injection
   systems including a cam mechanism and a common rail system. A
   mathematical model of the DDVC for simulation is summarized. Experiments
   of fuel injection shows the control function of the DDVC fuel injection
   system. The topic of this paper is feedback control of the quantity of
   fuel injection (fuel mass per injection) of the DDVC. The feedback
   control system is simulated using the above mathematical model. Fuel
   injection is stopped by switching a drive signal of the AC servomotor
   and retracting a piston of the hydraulic cylinder. The timing to stop
   injection is adjusted based on crank angle. An algorithm of updating the
   crank angle to stop injection is proposed so that the quantity of fuel
   injection follows the target value. Simulation study shows that the
   update algorithm works successfully.},

Abstract = {In this paper, two Discrete Displacement Cylinders (DDCs) arc used to
   drive the boom of a knuckle boom crane. DDCs operate by connecting one
   of several available pressure levels to each chamber in order to produce
   different forces. A trade-off exists with such systems, between the
   accuracy of tracking and energy dissipation due to switching. A popular
   way to approach this problem is a Force Shifting Algorithm (FSA).
   However, in this paper, the trade-off is managed by use of a Model
   Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The tracking accuracy and energy
   efficiency of the MPC and FSA strategies for DDCs are compared to a PID
   strategy for standard cylinders. The comparison is obtained by use of a
   computer simulation of a knuckle boom crane performing a realistic load
   cycle. The load cycle consists of the crane extending to pick up a load
   and then retracting to place it at an appropriate location. The main
   results show that MPC can deliver smoother and more accurate motion than
   FSA, while using less energy. Compared with standard cylinders and PID
   control, MPC uses less energy, but due to the switching of chamber
   pressures, the motion is smoother with the standard strategy. Both FSA
   and MPC can have degraded performance when a large change in load is
   introduced.},

Abstract = {The efficient coordination of fingertip forces to maintain static
   equilibrium while grasping an object continues to intrigue scientists.
   While many studies have explored this coordination, most of these
   studies assumed that interactions of hands primarily occur with rigid
   inanimate objects. Instead, our daily interactions with living and
   nonliving entities involve many dynamic, compliant, or fragile bodies.
   This paper investigates the fingertip force coordination on a
   manipulandum that changes its shape while grasping it. We designed a
   five-finger perturbation system with linear actuators at positions
   corresponding to each finger that would protrude outward from the center
   of the handle or retract toward the center of the handle as programmed.
   The behavior of the perturbed fingers and the other fingers while
   grasping this device was studied. Based on previous experiments on
   expanding and contracting handles, we hypothesized that each finger
   would exhibit a comparable response to similar horizontal perturbations.
   However, the response of the little finger was significantly different
   from the other fingers. We speculate that the central nervous system
   demonstrates preferential recruitment of some fingers over others while
   performing a task.},

Abstract = {In situ resource utilization (ISRU) is a critical part of sustainable
   and cost-effective space exploration. This paper presents a method of
   extracting volatiles from ice, ice-rich regolith, and hydrated soils

   is a double-walled coring auger with a heated inner wall. It drills to a
   target depth, obtains a core sample, heats it up, and captures volatiles
   in a condenser above the surface. Once extraction is complete, the corer
   is retracted and a dry core is left behind. A breadboard version of PVEx
   has been designed, fabricated, and tested. Initial tests were performed
   in limestone and blocks of ice to evaluate mechanical aspects of the
   system. During these tests, minor mechanical issues were identified and
   resolved. PVEx reached a 50-cm depth in limestone in 10 minutes and a
   similar depth in -20 degrees C ice blocks in 7 minutes, creating
   5-cm-diameter cores. Future tests will include drilling in a vacuum
   chamber and water extraction.},

Abstract = {Line-imaged measurements of temperature and major species, based on
   well-established Raman/Rayleigh/CO-LIF techniques, are used to better
   understand the scalar structure of piloted CH4/air jet flames with
   inhomogeneous inlets. Recent studies using a variant of the Sydney
   piloted burner have demonstrated that the blowoff velocity of a
   partially-premixed jet flame of CNG or CH4 and air can be increased
   significantly by tailoring the mixture fraction profile at the burner
   exit. This is done by adding a small, retractable central tube within
   the main tube of the burner and separately supplying fuel and air for
   partial premixing. Both tubes are located within the pilot annulus. When
   the central tube is retracted far upstream of the burner exit, the flame
   has the same stability as that of the original burner with homogeneous
   fuel-air composition at the jet exit. However, when the inner tube
   supplies fuel and is retracted an optimal distance (10-13 times the main
   tube diameter) the blowoff velocity is increased by nearly 40\%.
   Previous results indicated that combustion very close to the burner exit
   occurs in a stratified-premixed mode, augmenting the stabilizing effect
   of the pilot. This is followed by transition to a diffusion-dominated
   mode of burning within the first ten main tube diameters.
   The present paper provides a detailed examination of a series of piloted
   CH4/air jet flames with different inlet conditions and with a pilot
   flame that matches the composition and adiabatic flame temperature of
   CH4/air. It addresses trends in local extinction as well as differences
   in near-field flame structure. The evolution in the local mode of
   combustion is traced using instantaneous line-imaged realizations where
   the change in mixture fraction across a 1000 K interval is used as a
   conditioning variable. Doubly conditioned means of selected species mass
   fractions confirm that the flames with inhomogeneous inlet profiles
   undergo transition from a stratified-premixed mode of combustion to a
   diffusion-dominated mode of combustion within the first ten jet
   diameters. Calculations of strained laminar partially-premixed flames
   are used to gain insight on the effects of strain rate and fuel-side
   equivalence ratio on flame structure and the rate of heat release. These
   turbulent jet flames may serve as interesting test cases for models
   aimed at predicting the performance of practical burners that operate
   with mixed combustion modes. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute.

Year = {2022},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {While most insect-inspired robots come with a simple tarsus, such as a
   hemispherical foot tip, insect legs have complex tarsal structures and
   claws, which enable them to walk on complex terrain. Their sharp claws
   can smoothly attach and detach on plant surfaces by actuating a single
   muscle. Thus, installing an insect-inspired tarsus on legged robots
   would improve their locomotion on complex terrain. This paper shows that
   the tendon-driven ball-socket structure provides the tarsus with both
   flexibility and rigidity, which is necessary for the beetle to walk on a
   complex substrate such as a mesh surface. Disabling the tarsus' rigidity
   by removing the socket and elastic membrane of a tarsal joint, means
   that the claws could not attach to the mesh securely. Meanwhile, the
   beetle struggled to draw the claws out of the substrate when we turned
   the tarsus rigid by tubing. We then developed a cable-driven
   bio-inspired tarsus structure to validate the function of the tarsus as
   well as to show its potential application in the legged robot. With the
   tarsus, the robotic leg was able to attach and retract smoothly from the
   mesh substrate when performing a walking cycle.},

Abstract = {With the wide applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the
   maintenance of WSNs is becoming more and more important. WSNs are
   generally powered by batteries and are difficult to retract once they
   are deployed. Therefore maintainability must be considered before
   deployment. After the system is in use, we also need know which
   networking area has poor maintainability so that we can take the
   necessary measures in time. This paper proposes a method for evaluating
   the maintainability of WSNs based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
   and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FEC) from the system perspective.
   Firstly, we analyze the factors affecting the maintainability of WSNs,
   which is evaluated hierarchically by calculating AHP. The main factors
   are hardware and software of the WSN nodes, wireless communication unit,
   and working environment, which are divided into several sub-factors that
   affect the maintainability. Under the ambiguous environment, various
   factors are considered when evaluating the maintainability of WSNs
   through AHP. The maintainability is determined by weighted sub-factors
   and main factors. Finally, by evaluating the maintainability of the
   WSNs, the proposed method can provide a guidance in the WSN design,
   manufacture, network deployment, and maintenance.},

Abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the design and evaluation of a robust
   drive mechanism intended to robotically steer a thermal ablation
   electrode or similar percutaneous instrument. We present the design of
   an improved screw-spline drive mechanism based on a profiled threaded
   shaft and nut that reduces the part count and simplifies manufacturing
   and assembly. To determine the optimal parameters for the profile shape,
   an analytical expression was derived that relates the tolerance between
   the nut and shaft to the angular backlash, which was validated using
   SolidWorks. We outline the forward kinematics of a steering mechanism
   that is based on the concept of substantially straightening a pre-curved
   Nitinol stylet by retracting it into a concentric outer cannula, and
   re-deploying it at a different position. This model was compared to data
   collected during targeting experiments performed in ex-vivo tissue
   samples where the distal tip of the stylet was repositioned in ex-vivo
   bovine tissue and the location of its distal tip was recorded with CT
   imaging. Results demonstrated that the drive mechanism operated robustly
   and targeting errors of less than 2mm were achieved.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the simulation of real-time catheter navigation
   using an electro-mechanical device in our interactive surgical
   simulation system. The device consists of a position/ rotation
   measurement system, a mechanical system and a micro-controller. The
   mechanical system houses a set of simulated catheter and guidewire whose
   feel resembles their actual counterparts. Using optical encoders, the
   measurement system detects the rotations and displacements of the
   simulated catheter and guidewire. The movement signals are then analysed
   and accumulated by the micro-controller and sent to the workstation host
   via serial link. The device driver on the host computer further
   processes these signals and turns them into correctly scaled
   displacement and rotation values. By manipulating the simulated catheter
   on the device, the virtual catheter and guidewire are advanced,
   retracted or twisted in the virtual blood vessels. Accurate navigation
   of the catheter and guidewire is achieved through the use of efficient
   finite element methods. The images of the virtual catheter/guidewire and
   the virtual blood vessels are computed based on the user-specified zoom
   and pan factors. These images are superimposed on the corresponding
   fluoroscopic image and displayed in real-time on the computer screen.},

Abstract = {The intuitive idea. behind the notion of a pore network is that of
   representing a continuous domain P, the pore space, by a finite graph
   G(P) embedded onto P. In this paper we restrict ourselves to the
   two-dimensional case, formulate conditions on G(P) and show that under
   natural conditions on P there exists exactly one G(P). In our approach
   G(P) is a union of circuits. Thus, the mapping P -> G(P) is continuous
   with respect to the Hausdorff distance in contrast to the mapping of P
   onto its skeleton. We then interpret binary images of pore spaces as
   approximations of real pore spaces and present a parallel algorithm that
   takes a. binary image of P and approximates G(P). Moreover, all
   approximations of G(P) are strong deformation retracts of P. Our concept
   is a dual one, i.e., the dual of G(P) represents the grain matrix. Thus,
   notions like formation of pore throats and pores by grams can be
   expressed formally. In the experimental part we show that drainage
   simulations on (approximations of) G(P) agree well with pore-scale
   simulations on P.},

Year = {2000},
Volume = {65},

Abstract = {In the present paper we prove that the poser of all extensions of the
   logic defined by a class of matrices whose sets of distinguished values
   are equationally definable by their algebra reducts is the retract,
   under a Galois connection, of the poset of all subprevarieties of the
   prevariety generated by the class of the algebra reducts of the matrices
   involved. We apply this general result to the problem of finding and
   studying all extensions of the logic of paradox (viz., the
   implication-free fragment of any non-classical normal extension of the
   relevance-mingle logic). In order to solve this problem, we first study
   the structure of prevarieties of Kleene lattices. Then, we show that the
   poser of extensions of the logic of paradox forms a four-element chain,
   all the extensions being finitely many-valued and finitely-axiomatizable
   logics. There are just two proper consistent: extensions of the logic of
   paradox. The first is the classical logic that is relatively axiomatized
   by the Modus ponens rule for the material implication. The second
   extension, being intermediate between the logic of paradox and the
   classical logic, is the one relatively axiomatized by the Ex
   Contradictione Quodlibet rule.},

Title = {THE IMPACT OF CASE CHARACTERISTICS ON CHILD-ABUSE REPORTING DECISIONS},
Journal = {CHILD ABUSE \& NEGLECT},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-74},
Abstract = {Drawing distinctions on the basis of at least some case characteristics
   in making reporting decisions makes considerable sense. Using data from
   a national survey of mandated reporters that included vignettes in which
   case and personal characteristics were systematically varied, this paper
   examines the impact of selected characteristics while controlling for
   others. The data reveal that respondents noticed and responded to case
   characteristics. Abuse-relevant judgments and reporting intentions
   varied, often substantially, as a function of case characteristics.
   Three case characteristics-previous abuse, severity of abuse, and
   recantation-were powerful predictors of vignette outcomes. A history of
   previous abuse led to judgments of greater seriousness, a more salutary
   impact of a report, and greater likelihood of reporting. More severe
   abuse was more likely to be labelled as abuse, and was more likely to be
   reported. When the alleged victim retracted her accusation upon
   questioning by an authority figure, respondents were significantly less
   likely to intend a report. Child age, perpetrator intent and family
   socioeconomic status also influenced abuse-relevant judgments and
   reporting intentions. Respondents were more likely to intend a report
   when younger children, lazy or angry perpetrators and children from
   poorer families were portrayed.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a simplistic passive dynamic model that is able to
   create realistic quadrupedal walking, tolting, and trotting motions. The
   model is inspired by the bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP)
   model and consists of a distributed mass on four massless legs. Each of
   the legs is either in ground contact, retracted for swing, or is ready
   for touch down with a predefined angle of attack. Different gaits, that
   is, periodic motions differing in interlimb coordination patterns, are
   generated by choosing different initial model states. Contact patterns
   and ground reaction forces (GRFs) evolve solely from these initial
   conditions. By identifying appropriate system parameters in an
   optimization framework, the model is able to closely match
   experimentally recorded vertical GRFs of walking and trotting of
   Warmblood horses, and of tolting of Icelandic horses. In a detailed
   study, we investigated the sensitivity of the obtained solutions with
   respect to all states and parameters and quantified the improvement in
   fitting GRF by including an additional head and neck segment. Our work
   suggests that quadrupedal gaits are merely different dynamic modes of
   the same structural system and that we can interpret different gaits as
   different nonlinear elastic oscillations that propel an animal forward.},

Abstract = {Friction stir spot welding (FSSW) has shown great potential for reducing
   manufacturing steps, simplifying structural design, and lowering overall
   costs in automotive and aerospace applications. A variant of the
   friction stir welding process, FSSW involves, in its simplest form,
   plunging and retracting a weld tool into the materials to be joined at
   single location or at a series of locations along a joint line. Due to
   rapid processing times and increased reliability, the process is an
   attractive alternative to existing joining techniques such as riveting
   and resistance spot welding. The purpose of this project was to
   investigate the effect of engineered materials, such as chemical
   conversion coatings, aluminum cladding, anodizing, etc., placed on the
   faying surface to prevent or reduce corrosion of FSSW spot welds and the
   adjoining structure. This paper presents the results of this study on
   the use of interfacial/faying surface materials and the effectiveness of
   processing parameters developed for a new pin tool design and swept spot
   pattern. Effectiveness of the process was measured by the degree to
   which the interfacial/faying surface material is dispersed without
   producing detrimental effects on the mechanical integrity of the weld.},

Title = {Effects of strain-dependent surface stress on the adhesive contact of a
   rigid sphere to a compliant substrate},
Journal = {SOFT MATTER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2223-2231},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Recent experiments have reported that the surface stress of soft elastic
   solids can increase rapidly with surface strain. For example, when a
   small hard sphere in adhesive contact with a soft silicone gel is slowly
   retracted from its rest position, it was found that the retraction force
   versus displacement relation cannot be explained either by the
   Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory or a recent indentation theory
   based on an isotropic surface stress that is independent of surface
   strain. In this paper, we address this problem using a finite element
   method to simulate the retraction process. Our numerical model does not
   have the restrictions of the aforementioned theories; that is, it can
   handle large nonlinear elastic deformation as well as a
   surface-strain-dependent surface stress. Our simulation is in good
   agreement with experimental force versus displacement data with no
   fitting parameters. Therefore, our results lend further support to the
   claim that significant strain-dependent surface stresses can occur in
   simple soft elastic gels. However, significant challenges remain in the
   reconciliation of theory and experiments, particularly regarding the
   geometry of the contact and substrate deformation.},

Title = {Letting go: Evaluating spatial outcomes and political decision-making

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {176-184},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In planning literature, there are ample examples of well-documented
   cases of plan-making and formal decision making, and an equally
   substantial amount of literature devoted to implementation. However,
   limited case analyses exist from the perspective of political
   decision-making, currently perceived as ``a black box to planners{''}
   (Albrechts, 2003: 250). The City of Cape Town (CoCT), South Africa, have
   employed an urban edge as a growth management instrument in its Spatial
   Development Framework (CTSDF) since 2001 (City of Cape Town, 2009),
   however, the latest CTSDF (2017) retracted this instrument. Instead, the
   latest spatial strategy to manage growth centres on encouraging dense
   development that supports transit-oriented development in the urban
   core, whilst discouraging peripheral expansion by stating intent not to
   extend services towards the urban periphery in the short-term. This
   paper contributes to inquiry that tests the implementation of planning
   instruments in post colonial urban settings (Fekade, 2000; Barredo and
   Demicheli, 2003; and Kombe, 2005) by firstly, evaluating the physical
   extent of urban sprawl in the CoCT and secondly, by analysing the
   decision-making process that resulted in two large-scale amendments to
   the original urban edge, and ultimately the final termination of the
   urban edge policy.},

Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the existence of solutions to a nonlinear
   elliptic problem involving critical Sobolev exponent for a polyharmonic
   operator on a Riemannian manifold M. We first show that the best
   constant of the Sobolev embedding on a manifold can be chosen as close
   as one wants to the Euclidean one, and as a consequence derive the
   existence of minimizers when the energy functional goes below a
   quantified threshold. Next, higher energy solutions are obtained by
   Coron's topological method, provided that the minimizing solution does
   not exist. To perform this topological argument, we overcome the
   difficulty of dealing with polyharmonic operators on a Riemannian
   manifold and adapting Lions's concentration compactness lemma. Unlike
   Coron's original argument for a bounded domain in R-n, we need to do
   more than chopping out a small ball from the manifold M. Indeed, our
   topological assumption that a small sphere on M centered at a point p is
   an element of M does not retract to a point in M\textbackslash{}\{p\} is
   necessary, as shown for the case of the canonical sphere where chopping
   out a small ball is not enough. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Several subjects including hoisting, derricking and slewing of boom,
   extending and contracting of boom, setting down and retracting of
   outriggers, have to be carried out in truck crane operating reliability
   test according to native standard. It is a laborious and time consuming
   work which repeats hundreds or even ten hundreds times. In this paper, a
   Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based system was built to automatically
   count the number of each test item. To achieve counting numbers of
   status change of telescopic boom, extending length or hoisting height
   were measured by one pair of wireless ranging sensor nodes adopting
   Chirp Spread Spectrum technique. The status change of outriggers and
   boom was monitored by detecting signals from a group of hall sensors.
   The data were then transmitted to main software by ZigBee wireless
   sensor network based on star topology. The software was developed for
   further data processing and storage by Labwindows/CVI. Preliminary
   experiments that included simulation and on-the-spot test were
   conducted. The results show that the count is in accordance with actual
   number. It is helpful and practical to reduce labor intensity as well as

Abstract = {Inspection of natural gas pipelines is necessary to ensure their
   integrity. Considerable pipeline mileage exists where the lines,
   particularly those in the smaller-diameter range, have internal
   restrictions and/or low pressure/flow rates. Conventional magnetic flux
   leakage (MFL) inspection pigs cannot be used because the product flow
   and pressure is not sufficient to propel the pig, and the large MFL
   magnets cannot readily move through restricted areas. To overcome these
   problems, all untethered, self-powered tool was developed that can
   adjust to inspect different pipe sizes and call retract to pass through
   obstructions such as elbows and tees. Southwest Research Institute
   developed a remote-field eddy current (RFEC) inspection system for
   detecting and characterizing pipe wall loss, and this system was
   integrated with Explorer 11, a robotic transport device developed by
   Carnegie Mellon. The resulting tool has the capability to inspect 6- to
   8-inch-diameter pipelines containing tight bends and tees, and call be
   launched, operated, and retrieved with the pipeline in service. This
   paper describes the RFEC inspection technology, the RFEC system modules
   developed for Explorer II, and preliminary test results.},

Abstract = {We have previously described actin edge-bundles (AEBs) as cables of
   microfilaments lining the webbed edges of 3T3 cells (Zand and
   Albrecht-Buehler: Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton 13: 195-211, 1989). We have
   suggested that AEBs, along with their cell-substratum adhesions, resist
   cortical tension and prevent the collapse of cytoplasm towards the
   nucleus. In this paper, we report several stages of AEB disassembly and
   re-formation induced by the following micro-manipulations: (1) Scoring
   of the webbed edge of a 3T3 cells with a microneedle. As a result the
   sides of the score retracted and the severed AEB appeared to disassemble
   down to its terminal adhesion points. The retraction stopped after 20-40
   seconds and the cells formed a webbed edge with large curvature. Over a
   period of 20-80 minutes, the new web decreased in length and depth,
   until it regained its approximate original shape. (2) Bending of cell
   processes at acute angles. As a result the processes moved until they
   projected at right angles to the side of the cell and formed new webs

Abstract = {It is the first mission for a landing gear retraction system to extend
   the structure during the phases of take-off and landing of the flight.
   Besides, the structure should be available to improve the reliability,
   strength and stability of the system while reducing the influence of the
   landing gear on the total drag. However, a large number of airplane
   accidents are due to the malfunctions or failures of the landing gear
   retraction system. In this paper, a novel design of retraction system is
   proposed. Instead of having only one side-stay to execute the desired
   motion, this new design proposed an over-constrained mechanism with four
   side-stays, which augments the structural strength and stability of the
   landing gear system with six over constraints. With such configuration,
   a second actuating motor to retract the landing gear can be inserted
   regardless of the first actuator to augment the reliability on the
   execution of the mechanism. Analyses on the properties of the landing
   gear retraction system with four side-stays show that the landing gear
   strut has a vertical motion, which decreases the working and storage
   spaces used for the system. Finally, this paper examines the statics and
   the stiffness coefficients of the retraction system with respect to its
   structure parameters. This provides the optimum structure for the
   landing gear system in terms of strength and reliability.},

Abstract = {The controversy over vaccines, which has recently intensified following
   the COVID-19 pandemic, provokes heated debates, with both advocates and
   opponents raising allegations of bias and fraud in research. Researchers
   whose work raises doubts about the safety of certain vaccines claim to
   be victims of discriminatory treatment aimed at suppressing dissent,
   including the unjustified retraction of their published research. Such
   practices have previously been discussed in other controversial fields
   in science (e.g., AIDS, the environment, and water fluoridation) but not
   in the field of vaccines. The purpose of this study was to analyze, for
   the first time, the subjective views of researchers whose papers were
   retracted. Study participants are active researchers, most with
   international reputations in their respective fields. They perceived
   retraction as a means of censoring and silencing critical voices with
   the aim of preserving the pro-vaccination agenda of interested parties.
   Participants also reported additional measures aimed at harming them
   personally and professionally. These findings point to the need for a
   fair, open, and honest discourse about the safety of vaccines for the
   benefit of public health and the restoration of trust in science and
   medicine.},

Abstract = {Hydraulic position servos with an asymmetrical cylinder are commonly
   used in industry. These kinds of systems are nonlinear in nature and
   generally difficult to control. Because of parameters changing during
   extending and retracting, using constant gain will cause overshoot, poor
   performance or even loss of system stability. The highly nonlinear
   behaviour of these devices makes them ideal subjects for applying
   different types of sophisticated controllers. This paper is concerned
   with a second order adaptive model reference and an artificial neural
   network controller to position tracking of a servo hydraulic with a
   flexible load. In present study, a neural network with two outputs is
   presented. One of the outputs of neural network is used for system's
   dynamic compensator and another one for gain scheduling controller. To
   avoid the local minimum problem, Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA)
   is used to find the weights and biases of neural network. The proposed
   controller is verified with a common used p-controller. The simulation
   and experimental results suggest that if the neural network is chosen
   and trained well, it improves all performance evaluation criteria such
   as stability, fast response, and accurate reference model tracking in
   servo hydraulic systems.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {There are many experimental situations in which polymer chains are
   constrained or localised into a small region of space (e.g. melt chains
   confined to a ``tube{''}, network chains pinned by crosslinks). We show
   that detailed consideration of the quenched variables is vital in these
   experiments. This paper provides a crucial link between microscopic
   models with localising constraints and scattering: patterns by a
   generalisation of the Random Phase approximation (RPA) which allows for
   quenched translational variables. A method is developed which deals with
   correlations between the quenched variables brought about by
   incompressiblity (for example, in a polymer melt there are correlations
   between tubes because of the interaction between chains). As an example.
   the generalised RPA is applied to models based on the Warner-Edwards
   picture of the tube. Theoretical results for a melt of I-I-shaped
   copolymers are compared with experimental scattering. Early results
   suggest that to fit the scattering: we may be forced to relax one of the
   central assumptions of the tube model, that the tube deforms affinely,
   that all chains retract by the same amount or that the tube diameter
   does not couple to the strain.},

Title = {Research on Updating of Body Schema Using AR Limb and Measurement of the

Abstract = {The body schema, an internal model in the brain used to recall the body
   position, is known to be updated by adapting to the changes in the body
   figure due to the body growth. Furthermore, the recent research has
   reported the active updating of the body schema by misunderstanding
   one's body position using the illusion phenomenon. However, the current
   method of actively updating the body schema has limited effects and does
   not handle selective updating of each body part. Therefore, in this
   paper, a new method using an augmented reality (AR) limb is proposed for
   the selective updating of unitary parts of the body image in a short
   period of time. The AR limb is the virtual limb composed by actively
   extendable and retractable parts, projected by head-mounted display. The
   basic concept is that the body schema is updated to match the extended
   and retracted part of the AR limb based on the body schema learning
   mechanism in the sensory integration of visual and somatic information.
   The potential effectiveness of the method was verified by actual
   experiment applying the body schema update to the right forearm.},

Abstract = {This paper reports results of fatigue tests of friction stir welded
   (FSW) aluminium tubes. Relatively small 38 mm diameter tubes were used
   and hence an automated FSW process using a retracting tool was designed
   for this project, as the wall thickness of the aluminium tube was
   similar to the diameter of the FSW tool. This is a more complex joint
   geometry to weld than the more usual larger diameter tube reported in
   the literature. S-N fatigue testing was performed using load ratios of R
   = 0.1 and R = -1. Crack path analysis was performed using both low
   magnification stereo microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, in
   order to identify crack initiation sites and to determine the direction
   of crack propagation. Work is still in progress to follow the crack path
   through the various microstructural zones associated with the weld. A
   simple statistical analysis was used to characterize the most typical
   crack initiation site. This work forms part of a wider project directed
   at determining multiaxial fatigue design rules for small diameter
   6082-T6 aluminium tubes that could be of use in the ground vehicle
   industry.},

Abstract = {During the past TO years, the finite element method (FEM) has been
   successfully employed to model the neuroanatomy under varying load
   conditions. Loading conditions used in previous work can be
   predominantly separated into two categories. The first category concerns
   large accelerations of the head followed by a sharp deceleration or
   impact. The second category considers maladies of the brain such as
   edema and hydrocephalus. Our research is focused on creating a third
   category which involves the application of surgical loads. In
   neurosurgical procedures, various instruments are used which purposely
   retract/resect or inadvertently move tissue. In addition, other sources
   of brain shift include reduction in brain buoyancy due to cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) drainage and administered drugs such as mannitol which
   causes brain volume to decrease by transporting fluid away from the
   tissue via the brain vasculature. The concern is that intraoperative
   loads such as these will move designated subsurface operative areas and
   lead to surgical error. The ultimate goal of our research is to model
   surgical loads, predict subsequent deformation and update the surgeon's
   navigation fields in real time. However, the scape of this paper is
   limited to the development of an initial 3D model of brain deformation.},

Title = {Confining Liquids on Silicon Surfaces to Lubricate MEMS},
Journal = {TRIBOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Liquid lubrication may provide a solution to the problem of high
   friction and wear in micro-electromechanical systems. Although the
   effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated in laboratory-based
   friction tests, practical constraints prevent it from being applied in
   commercial devices. The main problem is how to position the lubricant on
   a silicon surface in order to limit spreading and evaporation. This
   paper describes two techniques to address this issue. First, low
   concentrations of additives are used to promote autophobic behaviour.
   Tests' results show that certain concentrations of both multiply
   alkylated cyclopentane and amine additives are effective in halting the
   spread of hexadecane on silicon, and, in the latter case, cause the
   hexadecane drop to subsequently retract. The second approach involves
   applying a micro-contact printing technique previously used on gold
   surfaces. Here, silicon surfaces are coated with
   octadecyltrichlorosilane mono-layers that are then selectively removed,
   using oxygen plasma, to leave regions of contrasting surface energy.
   Results from spin tests show that surfaces treated in this way can
   anchor 1 mu l drops of hexadecane and water when forces of up to 22 and
   230 mu N, respectively, are applied.},

Abstract = {Iterative flattening search (IFS) is an iterative improvement heuristic
   schema for makespan minimization in scheduling problems. Given an
   initial solution, IFS iteratively interleaves a relaxation-step, which
   randomly retracts some search decisions, and an incremental solving step
   (or flattening-step) to recompute a new solution. The process continues
   until a stop condition is met and the best solution found is returned.
   In recent work we have created a uniform software framework to analyze
   component techniques that have been proposed in IFS approaches. In this
   paper we combine basic components to obtain hybrid variants and perform
   a detailed experimental evaluation of their performance.
   Specifically, we examine the utility of: (1) operating with different
   relaxation strategies and (2) using different searching strategies to
   built a new solution. We present a two-step experimental evaluation: (a)
   an extensive explorative evaluation with a spectrum of parameter
   combination; (b) a time-intensive evaluation of the best IFS
   combinations emerged from the previous. The experimental results shed
   light on weaknesses and strengths of the different variants improving
   the current understanding of this family of meta-heuristics. (C) 2008

Abstract = {Flowrate control in Direct-Write (DW) Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   continues to be a challenge due to a capacitative energy storage in the
   system and the absence of suitable flowrate sensors at the micro-scale.
   Lack of precise control leads to an excess or a lack of ink while
   printing, resulting in manufacturing defects. The incorporation of a
   pressure sensor and a feedback controller is a potential approach for
   precisely controlling the flowrate. However, in the case where the ink
   loses contact with the pressure sensor, there will be an abrupt loss in
   feedback signal, which could potentially result in instability in the
   closed loop. In this paper, we present a hybrid model that represents
   the continuous dynamics of microextrusion with discrete switching
   between three different modes that captures the presence or loss of a
   sensed pressure. The simulation results demonstrate that the model
   captures the continuous dynamics of microextrusion while switching
   between three discrete modes: normal printing mode, retracted ink
   leading edge mode, and loss of pressure signal mode. The hybrid model
   presented here paves the way for switched controller synthesis to create
   stable feedback controllers.},

Abstract = {Given a nonempty, closed set K in a Hilbert space H, we consider the
   following two control problems involving the set K.
   1. For a nonlinear control problem with state x epsilon H we study the
   existence of a state feedback control, taking values in a Hilbert space
   H-1, which ``stabilizes{''} the set K in a precise sense, which is
   related to the viability of K.
   2. For a nonlinear control problem affected by deterministic uncertainty
   we look for a state feedback control, taking values in H-1, such that K
   is invariant under any system dynamics f, which is represented by a
   selection of the uncertain controlled dynamics.
   In this paper, by using methods from multivalued analysis, we will solve
   these problems for a suitable class of sets K subset of H: that of
   proximate retracts. Indeed, this class will provide us the necessary
   continuity property for the external contingent Bouligand cone to K and
   for the metric projection on K, which permit to use recent results on
   the existence of selections for multivalued maps. These selections will
   represent the required feedback control laws.},

Abstract = {Orthodontic treatment is based on the remodeling of the alveolar bone in
   response to externally applied orthodontic force to a tooth. The rate of
   bone resorption is, therefore, one of the essential factors for
   understanding tooth movement during orthodontic treatment. There is the
   basic concept of differential force in orthodontics that the application
   of an optimal force enables the canine to be moved without moving the
   molar that is used as an anchor for retracting the canine. In this
   paper, the resorption rates of the alveolar bone around the molar and
   the canine were estimated from the clinical measurements of tooth
   movement and the stress analyses of tooth roots using a 3-D finite
   element model. The model consisted of an orthodontic spring, the canine,
   the second premolar, and the first and second molars. The bone
   resorption rate to a unit stress at the molar was found to be about 0.5
   micron/(kPa.day) and almost the same as that of the canine. This result
   suggests that the concept of differential force can be explained simply
   by differences in the geometry of the roots of moved and fixed teeth.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for the identification of tissue
   properties in-vivo using a force sensitive wheeled probe. The purpose of
   such a device is to compensate a surgeon for a portion of the loss of
   haptic and tactile feedback experienced during robotic-assisted
   minimally invasive surgery. Initially, a testing facility for validating
   the concept ex-vivo was developed and used to characterize two different
   testing modalities - static (1-DOF) tissue indentation and rolling
   (2-DOF) tissue indentation. As part of the static indentation
   experiments a mathematical model was developed to classify tissue
   condition based on changes in mechanical response. The purpose of the
   rolling indentation tests was to detect tissue abnormalities, such as
   tumors, which are difficult to isolate under static testing conditions.
   During such tests, the test-rig was capable of detecting simulated
   miniature buried masses at depths of 12mm. Based on these experiments a
   portable device capable of carrying out similar tests in-vivo was
   developed. The device was designed to be operated through a trocar port
   and its key feature is the ability to transition between static
   indentation and rolling indentation modalities without retracting and
   changing the tool.},

Abstract = {A complex phenomenon in terms of psychological, sociological and legal
   aspects, adoption is a means of solving family problems of the child. It
   can also be a source of family problems if the rights of those involved
   in the adoption and especially if the fundamental rights and interests
   of the children are not respected.
   Adoption can be defined as the legal operation which creates filiation
   and civil kinship relationships between those stated by the law.
   Imposing the legal figure of adoption in the social life, the law
   virtually retracted the blood relationship, by creating a ``logical
   phenomenon of understanding{''} civil kinship, kinship which is
   substituted for the natural one.
   Although the desire regarding the child's upbringing and education is to
   keep him/her in the family home, however, where this is not possible the
   society sought legal mechanisms to offer these children permanent
   families to be raised and trained as would be the natural family.
   The research of this paper mixes quantitative research data which was
   carried out in 2009 in Romania with qualitative data which the author
   has collected through the semistructured interview method.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {363-389},
Abstract = {In the Appendix to A Treatise of Human Nature, Hume famously retracts
   his account of personal identity by confessing that it involves a
   profound problem he cannot solve, which I have elsewhere identified and
   called the Bundling Problem. Neither of the two possible solutions that
   Hume himself considers in the Appendix is a viable option for him by his
   own lights, which might suggest that any successful account of a unified
   self must go beyond the empirical framework. In this paper, I argue that
   we can find a strictly empiricist solution to Hume's problem in William
   James. I attempt to show that James's descriptions of our experience are
   phenomenologically more detailed and faithful to how experience is
   undergone from the first-person perspective, which allows him to explain
   our belief in an identical, unified self solely on empirical grounds.
   James finds unity and continuity right in the content of the stream of
   experience itself. A detailed investigation of James's accounts reveals
   that Hume's fundamental problem does not stem merely from his lack of
   empirical resources but, more importantly, from his tacit abandonment of
   the professed empiricist methodology.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine the effects of socially constructed financial
   market lending patterns in the Eurozone crisis. Under the assumption
   that the crisis is one of sovereign debt, the term ``contagion{''} is
   frequently used to describe the doubts about governmental debt repayment
   abilities that were spreading from Greece to Ireland and Portugal and
   then to Spain and Italy from 2010 to 2012. Consequently, austerity
   policies are indiscriminately applied to the governments of all five of
   these countries to ensure the countries' sustainable growth for their
   debt repayment. This paper, by contrast, argues that ``contagion{''} is
   the origin of peripheral repayment troubles rather than their effect.
   The Eurozone crisis is the result of the procyclical lending patterns of
   the European banking system, which turns liquidity shortages into
   solvency problems for governments depending upon debt roll-over
   operations. I then apply the related analysis to Germany's funding
   situation during the crisis and argue that ``stability,{''} i.e., the
   ability to maintain sustainable growth under Eurozone crisis conditions,
   is not the result of endogenous austere virtue. Rather, it is likewise
   largely a result of procyclical lending patterns: liquidity retracted
   from peripheral sovereign bonds is invested into core sovereign bonds.
   Moreover, I show that a similar effect has been in place prior to the
   crisis. ``Stability{''} is as contagious as ``contagion.{''}},

Title = {A new airborne tandem platform for collocated measurements of
   microphysical cloud and radiation properties},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {2},

Pages = {147-158},
Abstract = {A new airborne tandem measurement platform for cloud-radiation
   interaction studies is introduced in this paper. It consists of a
   Learjet 35A research aircraft and the AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle
   (AIRTOSS), which is an instrumented drag-body towed by the Learjet.
   Currently, the AIRTOSS is instrumented with a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP)
   for measuring cloud microphysical properties and an Inertial Navigation
   System (INS) for measurements of flight attitudes. The cable dragging
   AIRTOSS can be as long as four kilometres. Thus, truly collocated
   measurements in two altitudes above, in, and below clouds can be
   obtained. Results from first test flights with Learjet and AIRTOSS are
   reported here. The flights were performed from Hohn Airport, Germany.
   Specific manoeuvres were flown to test the aerodynamic behaviour of the
   drag-body and to investigate the suitability of AIRTOSS for
   high-precision irradiance measurements which require a stable flight
   attitude of AIRTOSS. The flight attitude data show that AIRTOSS is
   sensitive to several flight manoeuvres such as turns, altitude and
   airspeed changes, and also to changes of towing cable length. The
   effects of these manoeuvres on the attitude angles of AIRTOSS have been
   quantified. Maximum roll angle deviations were observed during turns.
   Even small changes in heading can lead to high roll angles (one degree
   change in heading causes a change in roll angle of about eight degrees).
   The pitch angle varies during climb or dive periods, extending or
   retracting of towing cable, acceleration or deceleration, and even when
   flying at too low or too high true airspeed depending on altitude.
   Values of pitch angle between -5 degrees (dive) and 8 degrees (climb and
   retracting towing cable) have been observed. While change in attitude is
   not problematic for cloud particle property measurements it is for
   radiation measurements. Here, the deviation from the horizontal should
   be no more than 3 degrees to avoid large errors. When keeping the above
   mentioned flight parameters constant, sufficiently stable flight
   conditions can be maintained to perform high-quality irradiance
   measurements with AIRTOSS in future experiments. During this test
   campaign also observations of cloud microphysical data as for example
   droplet number concentrations and size distributions with the AIRTOSS in
   stratocumulus clouds were performed to prove the compliance with
   scientific needs. Simultaneous spectral cloud radiation measurements
   have been made. The measurements of internal operational data of AIRTOSS
   as well as the first atmospheric data demonstrate the suitability of
   this tandem platform for detailed cloud microphysics and radiation
   interaction studies.},

Abstract = {Telemedicine focuses on improving the quality of health care,
   particularly in out-of-hospital settings. One of the most important
   applications is the continuous remote monitoring of vital parameters.
   Long-term monitoring of biopotentials requires skin-electrodes.
   State-of-the-art electrodes such as Ag/AgCl wet electrodes lead,
   especially during long-term application, to complications, e.g., skin
   irritations. This paper presents a low-cost, on-demand electrode
   approach for future long-term applications. The fully printed module
   comprises a polymeric substrate with electrodes on a flexible membrane,
   which establishes skin contact only for short time in case of
   measurement. The membranes that produce airtight seals for pressure
   chambers can be pneumatically dilated and pressed onto the skin to
   ensure good contact, and subsequently retracted. The dilatation depends
   on the pressure and membrane thickness, which has been tested up to 150
   kPa. The electrodes were fabricated in screen and inkjet printing
   technology, and compared during exemplary electrodermal activity
   measurement (EDA). The results show less amplitude compared to
   conventional EDA electrodes but similar behavior. Because of the
   manufacturing process the module enables high individuality for future
   applications.},

Title = {Evaluation of bus bridging scenarios for railway service disruption
   management: a users' delay modelling tool},
Journal = {PUBLIC TRANSPORT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Unexpected transit service disruptions degrade the quality of service
   provided to the public.Bus bridgingis considered a key response strategy
   used to handle metro service interruptions, where buses are retracted
   from scheduled services and deployed to offer shuttle services along
   disrupted segments. Most transit agencies rely on ad-hoc approaches
   (based on experience) to determine which buses should be dispatched from
   the scheduled services, with little (or no) consideration of the impacts
   on users' delays. This paper presents a practical tool to estimate the
   total users' delay associated with a user-specified bus bridging plan.
   The tool is based on deterministic queueing theory. The total delay is
   composed of two components; direct delays of affected metro passengers
   along the disrupted segment and indirect delays of bus riders on the
   routes from which shuttle buses are dispatched. The tool utilizes
   several input data, including travel times, train load information,
   boarding and alighting passenger counts, bus frequencies, and routes'
   cycle times. It provides transit practitioners and operational managers
   with a valuable instrument for evaluating different bus bridging
   scenarios. A case study of the transit network in Toronto is used to
   illustrate the tool's functionality.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the development and optimization of control
   parameters of an autonomous robot capable of traversing a planar surface
   without going beyond the surface boundary. Based on standard Lego (R)
   design, the proposed robot travels on surfaces with different
   geometrical shapes and collects data on the basis of which the perimeter
   can be redrawn using MATLAB. The remote detection capabilities of this
   robot can find its application in construction, defence surveillance
   operations, geological and space research and industry as an automated
   process of measurement, especially when the surface being measured is
   beyond human reach. The robot detects the edge using a color sensor
   which differentiates the color of the surface from its boundary. After
   detecting an edge point, the robot retracts and turns to detect an edge
   point in another direction. The length of the paths traversed by the
   robot from one edge point to another serves as the input data to the
   MATLAB program which computes this data and transforms it to a plot of
   the perimeter. Experiments conducted demonstrate the optimal values of
   parameters for control of motion of the robot to give satisfactory
   results with minimal power and time expenditure.},

Title = {A New Perspective in Adhesion Science and Technology: Testing Dynamic
   Failure of Adhesive Junctions for Space Applications},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {50},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1213-1223},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Under micro-gravity conditions, typical of the space environment,
   adhesion forces may play a relevant role in the manipulation of objects,
   especially when they must be released into free-fall under controlled
   residual velocity conditions. When only contact forces may be applied to
   the body that must be released to free-fall, no solution different from
   inertia is available to detach it from the manipulating device. If the
   manipulator is retracted from the body quickly enough, any adhesive bond
   existing between them is brought to failure, being loaded by the inertia
   force. The body acquires a residual momentum equal to the impulse
   developed by the adhesion force upon its failure. An experimental
   technique has been developed to characterize the impulse that adhesive
   junctions between two metallic rough surfaces develop upon dynamic
   failure, as part of the qualification of a system (the Caging Mechanism)
   designed for this specific function in the frame of the LISA Pathfinder
   space mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). This paper reports on
   the recent results obtained through the experimental campaigns performed
   in the LISA Pathfinder ground testing activities of the Caging
   Mechanism.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the problems of short spray distance and poor atomization
   effect in pesticide spraying. In addition, in order to enhance the
   initial velocity of the droplets and the secondary atomization of the
   droplets, a new air-driven combined electrostatic nozzle based on the
   Venturi effect is designed in this paper. And a method for accelerating
   and atomizing mist droplets using the Venturi effect is proposed.
   Combined with the distribution of airflow from the venturi, the
   acceleration and atomization effects of the nozzle were verified and
   analyzed. Using the factor design test method, three structural
   parameters, namely the distance A from the nozzle outlet to the venturi
   mouth, the retracting radius B of the venturi mouth, and the extension
   distance C of the venturi mouth were tested, and the following
   conclusions were drawn. At the 1\% significance level, the single
   factors A, B, and C have significant effects on the average velocity of
   the venturi throat. The interaction of two factors, AB, AC, and BC, had
   no significant effect on the average velocity of the venturi throat. The
   interaction of three factors ABC has a significant effect on the average
   velocity of the venturi throat.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a solution to the problem of 2D coverage path
   planning (CPP) for a tethered robot where the tether is of a constraint
   length connected to a fixed point in a known environment. Limited
   research has been done in this problem area hence there is a lack of
   algorithms providing CPP in the literature. CPP algorithms are highly
   useful in various applications such as search and rescue robots,
   cleaning robots, area exploration robots, agricultural robots and lawn
   maintenance robots. The path planning algorithm discussed here can be
   used in an environment having a defined boundary with an a priori map.
   The given algorithm enables the robot to take an optimum path while
   detecting, avoiding static obstacles and preventing entanglements of the
   tether. An occupancy grid map based approach is used here. The algorithm
   is applicable to a system with a mechanism to retract and extend the
   tether when required either mounted on the robot or a fixed base. The
   proposed novel algorithm to the problem assures coverage of all
   accessible grids in the map. The implementation and the scalability of
   the algorithm has also been validated using simulation in MATLAB.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the design of a new class of reconfigurable
   deployable Platonic mechanisms (RDPMs). At first, reconfigurable
   angulated element (RAE) with four half-platforms is designed and
   analyzed based on the reconfigurable property of angulated element.
   Using RAE as module, a method of synthesizing RDPMs is then proposed and
   three RDPMs are constructed. Starting from Type I generalised angulated
   element (GAE), a reconfigurable generalised angulated element (RGAE)
   comprised of two GAEs is investigated with its reconfigurable conditions
   identified. n pairs of straight elements (SE) and n pairs of angulated
   elements (AE) are further inserted into 2-RGAEs to construct
   n-SEs-2-RGAEs and n-AEs-2-RGAEs. The fully-retracted state and
   fully-expanded state of n-SEs-2-RGAEs and n-AEs-2-RGAEs are also
   detailed. Using 1-AE-2-RGAEs, three RDPMs with large magnification ratio
   are constructed in 3D software and fabricated using aluminum to verify
   their feasibility. This work provides a systematic approach to the
   design of RDPMs which can switch between two kinds of conventional
   deployable polyhedral mechanisms, including deployable polyhedral
   mechanisms with radially reciprocating motion and Hoberman spheres. (C)

Title = {Single molecule force measurements delineate salt, pH and surface
   effects on biopolymer adhesion},
Journal = {PHYSICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper we probe the influence of surface properties, pH and salt
   on the adhesion of recombinant spider silk proteins onto solid
   substrates with single molecule force spectroscopy. A single engineered
   spider silk protein (monomeric C-16 or dimeric (QAQ)(8)NR3) is
   covalently bound with one end to an AFM tip, which assures long-time
   measurements for hours with one and the same protein. The tip with the
   protein is brought into contact with various substrates at various
   buffer conditions and then retracted to desorb the protein. We observe a
   linear dependence of the adhesion force on the concentration of three
   selected salts (NaCl, NaH2PO4 and NaI) and a Hofmeister series both for
   anions and cations. As expected, the more hydrophobic C-16 shows a
   higher adhesion force than (QAQ)(8)NR3, and the adhesion force rises
   with the hydrophobicity of the substrate. Unexpected is the magnitude of
   the dependences-we never observe a change of more than 30\%, suggesting
   a surprisingly well-regulated balance between dispersive forces,
   water-structure-induced forces as well as co-solute-induced forces in
   biopolymer adhesion.},

Title = {Intelligent Structure Design of Learning Seats in University Smart
   Classroom under the Background of Intelligent Education},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Under the background of intelligent education, the study chairs of
   intelligent classrooms in colleges and universities should reflect
   humanistic care and design and guide students to establish a healthy
   learning style. To realize the intelligent classroom learning, the
   intelligent seat can be applied to different sitting positions or
   different heights and weights. This paper designs a control system based
   on MC9S08DZ60 and realizes the communication between the control system
   and the mobile app by combining the Bluetooth module based on CSR8670.
   At the same time, this paper proposes an intelligent design that can
   adjust the seat height by voice. LD3320 speech recognition module is
   used for voice control, and a push rod motor with a rising speed of 7
   mm/s is used to complete the lifting to meet the requirements of
   different sitting positions and different heights and weights. Then, the
   folding design of the intelligent seat for classroom learning is carried
   out. Infrared detectors are used at the armrests on both sides of the
   seat. When people have a tendency to sit down, they will speed up
   deployment. When a person leaves the seat, the seat will automatically
   retract. Finally, the objective evaluation method of pressure
   distribution test experiment is compared with the subjective scale
   evaluation of students, which verifies the effectiveness of the shape
   design of the chair in keeping students' healthy sitting posture for a
   long time.},

Abstract = {Let M be an open Riemann surface. It was proved by Alarcon and
   Forstneric {[}2] that every conformal minimal immersion M -> R-3 is
   isotopic to the real part of a holomorphic null curve M -> C-3. In this
   paper, we prove the following much stronger result in this direction:
   for any n >= 3, the inclusion i : RN{*}(M, C-n), -> M-{*}(M, R-n) of the
   space of real parts of nonflat null holomorphic immersions M -> C-n into
   the space of nonflat conformal minimal immersions M -> R-n satisfies the
   parametric h-principle with approximation (see Theorem 4.1). In
   particular, i is a weak homotopy equivalence (see Theorem 1.1). We prove
   analogous results for several other related maps (see Theorems 1.2 and
   5.6 and Corollary 1.3), and we describe the rough shape of the space of
   all holomorphic immersions M -> C-n (Theorem 1.4). For an open Riemann
   surface M of finite topological type, we obtain optimal results by
   showing that i and several related maps are inclusions of strong
   deformation retracts; in particular, they are homotopy equivalences (see
   Corollary 6.2 and Remark 6.3).},

Abstract = {The present paper establishes two new maps such as an M-map and an
   M-isomorphism which are generalizations of a Marcus Wyse (for brevity,
   M-) continuous map and an M-homeomorphism because an M-continuous map is
   so rigid that some geometric transformations are not M-continuous maps
   (see Remark 3.2). Furthermore, it proves that in Z(2) an M-map and an
   M-isomorphism are equivalent to a (digitally) 4-continuous map and a
   (digitally) 4-isomorphism, respectively. Besides, the paper proves that
   SCMAl1 is M-isomorphic to SCMAl2 if and only if l(1) = l(2), where SCMAl
   means a simple closed Marcus Wyse adjacent (for brevity, MA-) curve with
   1 elements in Z(2). Finally, the paper proves that MAC is equivalent to
   DTC(4) (see Theorem 6.7), where MAC is the category whose objects are
   M-topological spaces (X, gamma(X)) with MA-adjacency and morphisms are
   all M-maps f: (X,gamma(X)) -> (Y, gamma(Y)) for every ordered pair of
   objects (X,gamma(X)) and (Y, gamma(Y)), and DTC(4) is the category whose
   objects are digital images (X, k) in Z(2) and morphisms are (digitally)
   4-continuous maps. Besides, we propose the notion of an MA-retract for
   compressing 2D digital spaces. Using this new approach, we can
   substantially study and classify 2D digital topological spaces and 2D
   digital images. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the role of remorse and apology in international
   criminal trials by juxtaposing two prominent cases of convicted war
   criminals Biljana Plavsic and Esad Landzo. Plavsic was the first and
   only Bosnian Serb political leader to plead guilty before the
   International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Her
   acknowledgement of guilt and purported remorse expressed during her ICTY
   proceedings was celebrated as a milestone for both the ICTY and the
   Balkans. However, she later retracted her remorse while serving her
   prison sentence. Landzo was a guard at the notorious Celebici detention
   camp and did not acknowledge his guilt publicly during his ICTY trial.
   Seven years after his release from prison, Landzo personally confronted
   survivors and apologised to them. Through comparison of these two widely
   different cases, we illustrate varying roles criminal trials can play in
   offender's reflection on his/her crimes (instrumental remorse versus
   catalytic role) and how relevance and resonance of war criminal's
   remorse in and outside of the courtroom depend on how remorse is
   expressed and to whom (in abstracto during criminal proceedings versus
   personally face to face).},

Abstract = {Editors of scientific journals need to be conversant with the mechanisms
   by which scientific misconduct is amplified by publication practices.
   This paper provides definitions, ways to document the extent of the
   problem, and examples of editorial attempts to counter fraud.
   Fabrication, falsification, duplication, ghost authorship, gift
   authorship, lack of ethics approval, non-disclosure, `salami'
   publication, conflicts of interest, auto-citation, duplicate submission,
   duplicate publications, and plagiarism are common problems. Editorial
   misconduct includes failure to observe due process, undue delay in
   reaching decisions and communicating these to authors, inappropriate
   review procedures, and confounding a journal's content with its
   advertising or promotional potential. Editors also can be admonished by
   their peers for failure to investigate suspected misconduct, failure to
   retract when indicated, and failure to abide voluntarily by the six main
   sources of relevant international guidelines on research, its reporting
   and editorial practice. Editors are in a good position to promulgate
   reasonable standards of practice, and can start by using consensus
   guidelines on publication ethics to state explicitly how their journals
   function. Reviewers, editors, authors and readers all then have a better
   chance to understand, and abide by, the rules of publishing.},

Abstract = {There is a wealth of structural information on the drug-enzyme complex,
   dihydrofolate reductase and methotrexate. However, the dissociation
   dynamics of the complex remain relatively poorly understood. This paper
   describes the application of the atomic force microscope to quantify the
   rupture forces upon the forced dissociation of the ligand from the
   enzyme. The intermolecular forces experienced between dihydrofolate
   reductase and methotrexate as a binary and ternary complex, and the
   effect of pH upon these forces were studied. The rate at which forced
   dissociation occurs is known to have a significant effect upon the
   forces experienced between receptor-ligand complexes. This dependency of
   rupture force upon retract velocity is investigated. A linear
   relationship between force and the logarithm of velocity is demonstrated
   for the forced dissociation of the binary complex, inferring the
   presence of a barrier in the energy landscape positioned approximately 3
   Angstrom away from the bound state. The influence of the cofactor,
   NADPH, upon these rupture forces was negligible, suggesting that the
   barrier probed does not facilitate the cooperativity of the ternary
   complex. However, protonation of the Asp26 residue situated deep within
   the methotrexate binding site results in a decrease in rupture force.},

Title = {A new developed in-between shots lithium evaporation coating system for
   improving plasma performance in EAST},

Abstract = {A new in-between shots evaporative lithium coating system has been
   successfully developed and implemented on the Experimental Advanced
   Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) for the 2017 campaign. This paper
   describes a novel technique for the introduction of lithium into the
   EAST vessel allowing evaporative coatings to be applied between
   discharges without requiring a significant amount of time to insert and
   retract the lithium source. This newly designed system utilizes a
   rotating axis driven by a vacuum dynamic sealing feedthough under remote
   control to open and close a shutter. A compression bellows, which drives
   the delivery tube, guarantees accurate position of the oven thus
   avoiding possible direct contact with the plasma. This allows the new
   evaporation system to be operated in two distinct modes. One mode is
   operated in-between shots to refresh pre-coated lithium film, the other
   is a real-time lithium vapor injection during plasma operations to
   provide active wall conditioning during long pulse plasma discharges. In
   this paper, operation of this new lithium deposition system in the
   in-between shots replenishment mode is described. Initial experiments
   show that this system worked well during the interval of discharges in
   EAST, and the in-between shots lithium coating effectively reduced the
   wall recycling and impurity concentrations. Moreover, the application of
   fresh lithium coating lead to sustain the plasma stored energy and
   confinement, as well as a reduction of impurity radiation.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {90012-90022},
Abstract = {Unidirectional transmission mechanism (UTM) is widely used in mechanical
   field. The UTM studied in this paper is the core component of the
   aircraft hatch system, which is used to transfer the power of the motor
   to drive the hatch to be retracted and locked automatically after the
   motor closes Aiming at the failure mode exposed in the experiment, the
   matching relations of both geometric parameters and mechanical
   parameters are studied, and the force analysis model of the UTM is
   established. The results show that the load of the UTM reaches its
   maximum at 65 degrees, and if the friction coefficient between the
   friction plates is less than its critical value, braking failure will
   occur, which is in agreement with the test phenomena. In order to
   further verify the failure mechanism and obtain the effects of the
   gradual damage on the performance, a parameterized simulation model is
   established, through which failure phenomenon in the test is recovered,
   and the correctness of the failure mechanism analysis is verified.
   Finally, combined with its failure mechanism, the maintenance advice is
   proposed, and the validity is verified through the simulation model.},

Abstract = {Background: The literature on scientific publication errors in medical
   research is limited, and no studies on emer-gency medicine publications
   have been conducted yet. This study aimed to investigate the
   characteristics of the publication errors in emergency medicine
   literature.Methods: This bibliometric study reviewed intervened
   publication errors in the manuscripts of seven high-impact emergency
   medicine journals from 2000 to 2020, covering twenty years, and
   evaluated the corrections in the forms of an erratum, corrigendum,
   addendum, and retracted papers. The detected publication error rate and
   the trend, error severity, and error types were calculated.Results: We
   detected 257 intervened scientific papers consisting of 251 corrections
   due to one or more publica-tion errors and six retractions. Authors were
   the primary source of the errors (93.2\%). Most of the errors were in
   the author attribution section (40.5\%). The published errors of 7.2\%
   had an impact on the paper's conclusion. Sim-ple typographic errors were
   the most common error type (62.5\%). The corrected publication error
   rate was 1.3\%, with a steady trend over the twenty years.Conclusions:
   Publications errors are inevitable, but it is possible to minimize them.
   The number of corrections in emergency medicine literature is at a low
   rate and show many similarities with the previous literature.(c) 2022

Abstract = {The design and fabrication of hierarchical multi-stable structures using
   multi-material Additive Manufacturing (AM) is presented. First a
   reversible bistable unit actuator is designed to serve as the basis of
   the design hierarchy. With this unit actuator, the authors present
   monolithically printed proof-of-concept structures that can transform to
   multiple activated states, all of which are stable without the need for
   continuous energy input. The equilibrium positions of these hierarchical
   designs are found through iterative form finding when necessary. The
   novel structures illustrated in this paper are only made possible
   through design for AM that exploits the capabilities of a
   multi-material, inkjet 3D printer. The design procedure is illustrated
   through two concepts. The first consists of a series of tetrahedra
   fabricated as tiled deployable triangles with the out-of-plane members
   consisting of the actuators in the retracted configuration. The second
   concept consists of multiple shape changing square unit modules ``tiled
   in a grid to achieve complex 3D activated states including a hemisphere,
   a hyperbolic paraboloid, a star and a cube. Their design and prototyping
   form the foundation for new types of active and deployable 3D printed
   structures.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for controlling the collision avoidance
   for surgical tools attended to our Minimally Invasive Surgical Robotic
   system. In our previous work, we have designed and developed Minimally
   Invasive Surgical Robotics System, MU-LapaRobot for the laparoscopic
   surgical application. The MU-LapaRobot is designed with mechanically
   constraint its motion through a small incision point, called
   remote-center of motion (RCM). The MU-LapaRobot is an active surgical
   tool holder aimed to use with standard surgical tools based on the
   collaborative robotic concept.
   This study is focusing on speed control of the robot initiate once the
   attached surgical tools are inserted into patient's body. The motions
   are controlled based on the operating regions according to the Euclidean
   distances and overlap workspace between tools and environment. The
   control is off once the attached surgical tools are retracted out of the
   patient's body. The algorithm is relied on the different regions around
   the operating regions. The motions (translation and rotation) of
   MU-LapaRobot are improved in its performance, especially, on its higher
   accuracy and stability without tremor in the operating area after
   employing our speed control algorithm.},

Title = {Temporal response of an initially deflected PDMS channel},
Journal = {NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Microfluidics is used in a wide array of applications including
   photonics, catalysis, optoelectronics, particle synthesis, bio-diagnosis
   and tissue engineering. Poly(dimethyl) siloxane (PDMS) is one of the
   most widely used materials for the fabrication of such devices. In many
   applications, applied flow gives rise to pressure variations along the
   length of the channel and a commensurate spatially varying channel
   height. We have previously performed a scaling analysis of the
   relaxation time of an initially deflected PDMS channel (Dendukuri et al
   2007 Lab Chip 7 818-28). The prior study did not consider the dynamic
   evolution of the initially deflected channel and, being a scaling
   theory, required a fitting parameter for a priori predictions. In this
   paper, we analyze the dynamic behavior of a retracting PDMS wall after
   the removal of an external stress. For small deflections, the problem
   lends itself to a regular perturbation analysis that is analytically
   solvable at zeroth order. We find that the zeroth-order solution is very
   close to the numerically solved full solution for most situations of
   experimental interest. We further demonstrate that our model captures
   both qualitative and quantitative trends seen in the prior (Dendukuri et
   al 2007) and newly performed experiments.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a deployable boom which combines a rigid telescopic
   frame and a flexible tape spring. The front end of the spring is fixed
   on the rear end of the innermost segment of the frame. The spring
   spreads and rolls up inside the frame to drive the segments to move one
   by one to realize the boom deployment and retraction. The driving forces
   needed to deploy and retract the frame are modeled and simulated. The
   feasibility of the frame driving by only one spring is also studied. A
   1.6 kg prototype system with 2.1 m total deployment length is
   implemented. Experimental results show the maximum driving forces for
   deployment and retraction of the frame are about 9.1 N and 6.8 N
   respectively. The boom is able to deploy in 76 s with energy consumption
   of 315 J. The boom can resist at least 15 N force axially and 31.5 N.m
   bending moment when the forces are acted on its front end. Advantages of
   this kind of boom enable it to be applied for instruments deployment,
   walking and sampling assists, and robotic arms design in space
   exploration.},

Title = {How to dip nectar: optimal time apportionment in natural viscous fluid
   transport},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Number = {24},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The mouthparts of some animals are highly evolved fluid transporters.
   Most honeybees dip viscous nectar in a cyclic fashion by using
   protrusible tongues with active hairs that can erect rhythmically. The
   glossal hairs flatten when the tongue extends into the nectar; and then
   erect outwards like an umbrella to catch nectar while retracting. This
   paper examines the potential capability of honeybees in allocating the
   duration of the tongue protraction and retraction phases for the sake of
   energy saving. A physical model is established to analyze energy
   consumption induced by viscous drag, considering tongue kinematics and
   variation of the surface profile in different phases of tongue
   movements. The results indicate that the theoretically optimal time
   apportionment ratio at which the energy consumption is the minimum, is
   directly related to the square root of the tongue's diameter ratio
   between the protraction and retraction phase. Through dipping
   observations, we validate that the duration for the protraction and
   retraction phases show high accordance with the theoretical prediction.
   These findings not only broaden the insights into honeybee's foraging
   strategy but inspire the design of high-performance microfluidic pumps
   with dynamic surfaces to transport viscous fluid.},

Title = {THE STRUCTURE OF A DEWETTING RIM WITH STRONG SLIP: THE LONG-TIME
   EVOLUTION},
Journal = {MULTISCALE MODELING \& SIMULATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1365-1391},
Abstract = {When a thin viscous film dewets from a solid substrate, the liquid forms
   a characteristic rim near the contact line as the contact line retracts.
   The shape of the rim and also the retraction rate vary strongly with the
   amount of slip that occurs at the liquid-solid substrate. If the slip
   length is very large compared to the thickness of the film, extensional
   stresses dominate the shear stresses, and the film evolution can be
   modeled by a thin-film model similar to the ones that occur in freely
   suspended films, with a correction from the viscous friction due to the
   large but finite slip. Asymptotic investigation of this model reveals
   that the rim has an amazingly rich asymptotic structure that moreover
   changes as the solution passes through four distinct time regimes. This
   paper continues previous work that focused on the first of these regimes
   {[}P. L. Evans, J. R. King, and A. Munch, Appl. Math. Res. Express.
   AMRX, 2006 (2006), 25262]. The structure of the solution is analyzed in
   detail via matched asymptotics and then the predictions for the contact
   line and profile evolution are compared with numerical results.},

Abstract = {We often reach conclusions partially on the basis that we do not have
   evidence that the conclusion is false. A newspaper story warning that
   the local water supply has been contaminated would prevent a person from
   drinking water from the tap in her home. This suggests that the absence
   of such evidence contributes to her usual belief that her water is safe.
   On the other hand, if a reasonable person received a letter telling her
   that she had won a million dollars, she would consciously consider
   whether there was any evidence that the letter was a hoax or somehow
   misleading before making plans to spend the money. All to often we
   arrive at conclusions which we later retract when contrary evidence
   becomes available. The contrary evidence defeats our earlier reasoning.
   Much of our reasoning is defeasible in this way. Since around 1980,
   considerable research in AI has focused on how to model reasoning of
   this sort. In this paper, I describe one theoretical approach to this
   problem, discuss implementation of this approach as an extension of
   Prolog, and describe some application of this work to normative
   reasoning, learning, planning, and other types of automated reasoning.},

Title = {Emphasis Harmony in Arabic: A Critical Assessment of Feature-Geometric
   and Optimality-Theoretic Approaches},
Journal = {LANGUAGES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This overview article examines vowel-consonant harmony, specifically
   emphatic harmony (also referred to as pharyngealization, velarization,
   or uvularization), which is found in Semitic languages. It provides a
   comprehensive overview of emphasis harmony in Arabic dialects from
   feature-geometric and optimality-theoretic perspectives. From the
   feature geometric account, emphatic consonants are considered as a
   natural class within the guttural group that has the {[}pharyngeal] or
   {[}RTR] `retracted tongue root' feature. This view has been questioned
   and challenged recently by some researchers who argue for the exclusion
   of emphatics from the guttural group. The different arguments discussed
   in this paper show that researchers cannot reach a consensus regarding
   which consonants belong to the guttural group and which features are
   shared between these consonants. This paper shows that studies adopting
   an optimality-theoretic perspective provide a more comprehensive view of
   emphasis harmony and its fundamental aspects, namely, directional
   spreading and blocking, spread from secondary emphatic /r/ and
   labialization. However, this paper reaches two main conclusions.
   Firstly, unlike feature geometry, optimality theory can provide a
   clearer picture of emphasis harmony in an accurate and detailed way,
   which does not only clarify the process in one Arabic dialect but also
   describe the differences between dialects due to the merit of
   (re)ranking of constraints. Secondly, emphasis harmony is different from
   one Arabic dialect to another regarding its direction, involvement of
   emphatic /r/, and labialization. These differences between dialects
   indicate that emphasis harmony is not an absolute phenomenon.},

Abstract = {On rare occasion, aircraft tires have burst in flight after being
   retracted into the wheel well. The burst rapidly releases a
   high-pressure plume of gas that may cause damage to systems and
   structure mounted in the wheel well. Since airplanes must be designed to
   maintain continued safe Right and landing following a tire burst in the
   wheel well, it is essential that accurate definitions of the plume
   pressure loads be provided to the airplane structural and systems
   designers. Existing plume load definitions have been developed over the
   years from test data and theoretical calculations, but given the very
   short duration of the event and the complexity of the dynamics involved,
   it is desired to validate the existing threat definitions through the
   use of advanced finite element modeling. This paper describes the use of
   LS-DYNA to accurately predict the pressure plume created from the
   controlled release of a pressurized tank. This task is considered part
   of the validation phase. The next step will include the complexities of
   the deforming tire to quantify the effect of the rapidly changing hole
   diameter, and to study how the solution diverges from the classical
   prediction.},

   assign to each point a sequence of canonical approximations. The
   morphisms are stable maps that preserve the levels of approximation

   about the input of at most the same level of approximation. It is shown
   that the category of these domains and maps is Cartesian closed. The set
   of morphisms between two such domains is a domain of the same kind, but
   turns out not to be an exponent in the category.
   Domains D are constructed which are isomorphic to the exponent D-D.
   Moreover, it is proved that the space of retractions in an exponent D-D
   is a retract of this. Both results together provide new models of
   Amadio-Longo's extension lambda beta p of the lambda-calculus. As has
   been shown by Amadio and Longo, strong type theories which incorporate
   the Type: Type assumption can be syntactically interpreted in this
   calculus. (C) 1999-Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents newly discovered evidence from the personal
   correspondence of four US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Biological
   Effects of Atomic Radiation (BEAR) Genetics Panelists that their 1956
   report to the public was written by a third party and was neither
   reviewed nor approved by the Panel prior to its publication and release
   to the public. The letters revealed that the 1956 Report contained
   serious errors and did not represent the views of the Panel. The failure
   of the US NAS to notify the public that the Report had not been reviewed
   and approved by the Panel represents a serious breach of ethics. Further
   ethical issues relate to the failure of the NAS to (1) correct the
   errors in the Report within an appropriately timely manner and (2)
   reveal the lack of approval by the Panel even after the Report's
   release. In light of these discoveries and the profound historical-and
   continuing-significance of the 1956 Report to all conventional
   cancer-related risk assessment processes, we opine that this ethical
   improbity must be acknowledged and that this document must be retracted
   by the NAS.},

Volume = {84},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {57-112},

Abstract = {This paper presents a formalism that combines useful properties of both
   logic and probabilities, Like logic, the formalism admits qualitative
   sentences and provides symbolic machinery for deriving deductively
   closed beliefs and, like probability, it permits us to express if-then
   rules with different levels of firmness and to retract beliefs in
   response to changing observations. Rules are interpreted as
   order-of-magnitude approximations of conditional probabilities which
   impose constraints over the rankings of worlds. Inferences are supported
   by a unique priority ordering on rules which is syntactically derived
   from the knowledge base. This ordering accounts for rule interactions,
   respects specificity considerations and facilitates the construction of
   coherent states of beliefs, Practical algorithms are developed and
   analyzed for testing consistency, computing rule ordering, and answering
   queries, Imprecise observations are incorporated using qualitative
   versions of Jeffrey's rule and Bayesian updating, with the result that
   coherent belief revision is embodied naturally and tractably. Finally,
   causal rules are interpreted as imposing Markovian conditions that
   further constrain world rankings to reflect the modularity of causal
   organizations. These constraints are shown to facilitate reasoning about
   causal projections, explanations, actions and change.},

Title = {MEMS-Based Intraoperative Monitoring System for Improved Safety in
   Lumbar Surgery},
Journal = {IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL},

Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1541-1548},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper presents the design and characterization of a
   microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based intraoperative monitoring
   system for improving lumbar surgery safety. A MEMS pressure-sensing
   module is designed and incorporated into a nerve root retractor tip to
   directly monitor pressure exerted on a nerve root during a lumbar
   surgery. Animal experiments are conducted for intraoperative pressure
   monitoring to investigate effects of nerve root retraction during a
   surgery. Amplitude and latency of electrophysiological response of a
   nerve root are measured during different time intervals after retraction
   under various retraction magnitude and duration conditions. Correlation
   between exerted pressure on a retracted nerve root and its
   electrophysiological response is investigated. The relationship between
   intraoperative pressure and alteration of neural tissue structure is
   analyzed by morphological observation. Experimental results indicate
   that a nerve root injury is strongly related to the magnitude and
   duration of its retraction. The prototype MEMS-based intraoperative
   monitoring system can potentially alert surgeons about risk factors
   associated with nerve root injury during a lumbar surgery as well as
   provide critical surgical guidelines. The system can also serve as a
   basis for implementing an intelligent robotically controlled closed-loop
   lumbar surgical operating system in the future.},

Title = {Transformable Wheelchair-Exoskeleton Hybrid Robot for Assisting Human
   Locomotion},
Journal = {ROBOTICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel wheelchair-exoskeleton hybrid robot that can
   transform between sitting and walking modes. The lower-limb exoskeleton
   uses planetary-geared motors to support the hip and knee joints.
   Meanwhile, the ankle joints are passive. The left and right wheel
   modules can be retracted to the lower legs of the exoskeleton to prepare
   for walking or stepping over obstacles. The chair legs are designed to
   form a stable sitting posture to avoid falling while traveling on smooth
   surfaces with low energy consumption. Skateboard hub motors are used as
   the front driving wheels along with the rear caster wheels. The turning
   radius trajectory as the result of differential driving was observed in
   several scenarios. For assisting sit-to-stand motion, the desired joint
   velocities are commanded by the user while the damping of the motors is
   set. For stand-to-sit motion, the equilibrium of each joint is set to
   correspond to the standing posture, while stiffness is adjusted on the
   basis of assistive levels. The joint torques supported by the
   exoskeleton were recorded during motion, and leg muscle activities were
   studied via surface electromyography for further improvement.},

Abstract = {Let X be a del Pezzo surface of degree 5 defined over a field F. A
   theorem of Manin and Swinnerton-Dyer asserts that every Del Pezzo
   surface of degree 5 is rational. In this paper we generalize this result
   as follows. Recall that del Pezzo surfaces of degree 5 over a field F
   are precisely the F-forms of the moduli space M (\$) over bar 0,5 of
   stable curves of genus 0 with five marked points. Suppose n5 is an
   integer, and F is an infinite field of characteristic 2. It is easy to
   see that every twisted F-form of M of stable curves of genus 0 with five
   marked points. Suppose n 5 is an integer, and F is an infinite field of
   characteristic = 2. It is easy to see that every twisted F- form of M0,
   n is unirational over F. We show that ( a) if n is odd, then every
   twisted F- form of M0, n is rational over F; ( b) if n is even, there
   exists a field extension F/ k and a twisted F- form X of M0, n such that

Abstract = {The falsification of data related to c-kit+ cardiac progenitor cells
   (CPCs) by a Harvard laboratory has been a veritable tragedy. Does this
   fraud mean that CPCs are not beneficial in models of ischemic
   cardiomyopathy? At least 50 studies from 26 laboratories independent of
   the Harvard group have reported beneficial effects of CPCs in mice,
   rats, pigs, and cats. The mechanism of action remains unclear. Our group
   has shown that CPCs do not engraft in the diseased heart, do not
   differentiate into new cardiac myocytes, do not regenerate dead
   myocardium, and thus work via paracrine mechanisms. A casualty of the
   misconduct at Harvard has been the SCIPIO trial, a collaboration between
   the Harvard group and the group in Louisville. The retraction of the
   SCIPIO paper was caused exclusively by issues with data generated at
   Harvard, not those generated in Louisville. In the retraction notice,
   the Lancet editors stated: ``Although we do not have any reservations
   about the clinical work in Louisville that used the preparations from
   Anversa's laboratory in good faith, the lack of reliability regarding
   the laboratory work at Harvard means that we are now retracting this
   paper{''}. We must be careful not to dismiss all work on CPCs because of
   one laboratory's misconduct. An unbiased review of the literature
   supports the therapeutic potential of CPCs for heart failure at the
   preclinical level.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Directional motion, current reversal and mass separation in
   an asymmetrical periodic potential (Retracted article)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT},
Year = {2009},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fluctuation-induced transport in an asymmetric periodic potential driven
   by a static bias and correlated noises is investigated for the
   overdamped and underdamped cases. Using both theoretical predictions and
   numerical simulations, we study the steady current of an overdamped
   Brownian particle moving in the potential. It is shown that an
   asymmetric periodic potential driven by a static bias and the correlated
   noises is simultaneously able to exhibit directional transport and
   current reversal. For the underdamped case, we examine the dynamics at
   various inertial strengths by means of direct simulations of the
   stochastic differential equations. We especially focus on the influence
   of inertial terms in the particle dynamics for the noise-induced,
   directed current. It is found that the inertial ratchet possesses
   current reversals as a function of the mass of the particle; thus an
   efficient scheme for separating different species of particles according
   to their different masses is suggested.
   ``This paper has substantial overlap with the papers `Directional
   motion, current reversals and mass separation in a symmetrical periodic
   potential' by Yu-Hui Luo and Chong-Wei Xie (2009 Phys. Lett. A 373

Title = {Ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases: inhibitors as promising

Journal = {EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES},

Volume = {27},

Pages = {46-65},
Abstract = {Ferroptosis is a new form of iron-dependent programmed cell death,
   characterized by intracellular iron overload and lipid peroxidation.
   Several studies have revealed that ferroptosis is associated with the
   occurrence and development of various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs).
   Therefore, this paper reviews the mechanism and related genes of
   ferroptosis, focusing on the research of antiferroptosis drugs in NDs to
   provide theoretical support for future experimental research and
   clinical application.
   This work focuses on ferroptosis, and the authors searched the
   literature on PubMed related to ferroptosis using the keywords
   ``neurodegenerative diseases{''} and ``neurons{''}. All articles were
   from August 2022 and earlier, excluding irrelevant or retracted
   articles, and articles from the last five years were used as the main
   inclusion criteria.
   After collection and summary, it was found that ferroptosis in NDs was
   not only related to iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid
   metabolism but also related to genes such as Nrf2, FSP1, VDACs, and p53.
   We also summarized drugs that inhibited ferroptosis in NDs and
   classified them according to their mechanism of action.
   Ferroptosis was involved in the progression of NDs through its
   production mechanism and related genes. Targeting ferroptosis might be a
   new strategy for treating NDs.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a proof-of-concept study of a novel active joint
   that has an impressive potential application into solar panels for
   providing the panels with not only self-deploying/folding functions but
   also active vibration control capacity. The active joint possesses a
   compact structure and integrates with an electro-permanent-magnet
   driving mechanism, based on the direct drive principle. Firstly, the
   sequential quadratic programming (SQP) optimization method is conducted
   for achieving maximum driving torque. Then, the dynamic model of driving
   magnetic field and solar panels system is established in detail and the
   expected functional performance is discussed. Finally, numerical
   simulations and ground experiments results demonstrate that, the panel
   can be directly actuated to expand/retract steadily in about 38 s as
   expected. Meanwhile, ground experimental results validate that, the
   major frequency bandwidth of interference signal is 0.047-0.16 Hz with a
   significant vibration attenuation of 8.49-2.07 dB in effective
   bandwidth. Moreover, the proposed new mechanism is quite effective to
   vibration control, especially for low frequency below 1 Hz and large
   amplitude vibration of spacecraft. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Background. The lower third of the face and neck have distinct changes
   that occur with aging the lost of the perfect jaw line due to laxicity
   of skin and fat deposits associated with ``turkey neck{''} Theses
   changes can be globally and drastically addressed with traditional
   rhytidectomy, however patients increasingly seek less invasive
   procedures Injections with Lipostabil (R) Endovena-a mixture of
   phosphatidylcholine and deoxycholate, a bile salt have been used to
   reduce unwanted, accumulated fat Recent in vivo investigations indicate
   that phosphatidylcholine and deoxycholate cause adipocyte lysis, an
   inflammatory processes and fibrosis These reactions lead to skin
   retraction
   Objective: This paper reports the author's experience treating aging
   neck using Lipostabil Endovena
   Results: Laxity of the skin improved in all patients A marked reduction
   in double chins was noted and the law line was reconstructed Adverse
   effects, including transient burning, erythema and local swelling were
   present in all patients, but resolved themselves without intervention
   Conclusion: The author's clinical experience supports the conclusion
   that Lipostabil Endovena treats subcutaneous fat tissue and that
   fibrosis after the inflammatory process retract the skin, tightening the
   injected area and improving the aging neck},

Abstract = {Observations are presented showing that mature thalli of the rumen
   anaerobic fungal isolate Neocallimastix frontalis strain RE1 attach to
   cellulose. This process and subsequent development of the thalli have
   been studied. Thalli matured without attachment and then attached
   directly by means of rhizoids to the surface of the substrate. This
   process was quantified by the measurement of attachment of
   C-14-radiolabelled fungal cells pregrown on {[}UL-C-14]-D-glucose to
   filter paper. Washed cell suspensions were separated into zoospores and
   thalli by filtration and the time-course of attachment of each fraction
   to filter paper strips was determined. Both thalli and zoospores made a
   significant contribution to the colonization process, it is suggested
   that the previously unrecognized ability of mature thalli to attach to
   cellulose could be of importance in the degradation of plant material in
   the rumen.
   After attachment to filter paper the Formation of dark brown pigmented
   sporangia was observed after incubation for periods in excess of 4 d.
   These had some similarities to resistant sporangia which have been
   described in aerobic and anaerobic chytrids, but they differed in some
   important respects. The pigmented cytoplasm retracted, leaving a clear
   margin within an unthickened cell wall. Histochemical tests showed that
   the pigment was not melanin and strain RE1 was able to grow and form the
   pigment in the presence of each of three inhibitors, tricyclazole, PP389
   and glyphosate, which block melanin biosynthesis pathways in fungi.},

   scoping review},
Journal = {JAMIA OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Lay Summary Medication errors affect more than 7 million patients in the
   United States per year, contributing to injury and death. Since the
   introduction of electronic prescribing, new error types have been
   reported, such as wrong-patient prescribing. These error types are
   poorly understood. This review investigated: (1) what automated search
   methods can identify wrong-patient order entry (WPOE), (2) what data are
   being captured and how they are being used, (3) the causes of WPOE, and
   (4) how providers identify their own errors. Fifteen papers were
   reviewed and several automated search methods identified. (1) The
   retract-and-reorder method is the most popular method of identifying
   WPOE, with a good positive predictive value (PPV) of 76.2\%, but is
   specific only for WPOE. The Void Alert Tool is nonspecific for WPOE,
   with a mean PPV of 78\%-93.1\%, but the accuracy of voiding reason
   varies considerably. (2) The error data captured are the number of
   incorrectly placed orders, which are used to report on the background
   error rate or assess the effectiveness of an intervention. (3)
   Technological factors and interruptions were deemed the biggest risk
   factors for WPOE. (4) Minimal data on how providers identify their own
   errors was identified.
   Objective To investigate: (1) what automated search methods are used to
   identify wrong-patient order entry (WPOE), (2) what data are being
   captured and how they are being used, (3) the causes of WPOE, and (4)
   how providers identify their own errors. Materials and Methods A
   systematic scoping review of the empirical literature was performed
   using the databases CINAHL, Embase, and MEDLINE, covering the period
   from database inception until 2021. Search terms were related to the use
   of automated searches for WPOE when using an electronic prescribing
   system. Data were extracted and thematic analysis was performed to
   identify patterns or themes within the data. Results Fifteen papers were
   included in the review. Several automated search methods were
   identified, with the retract-and-reorder (RAR) method and the Void Alert
   Tool (VAT) the most prevalent. Included studies used automated search
   methods to identify background error rates in isolation, or in the
   context of an intervention. Risk factors for WPOE were identified, with
   technological factors and interruptions deemed the biggest risks.
   Minimal data on how providers identify their own errors were identified.
   Discussion RAR is the most widely used method to identify WPOE, with a
   good positive predictive value (PPV) of 76.2\%. However, it will not
   currently identify other error types. The VAT is nonspecific for WPOE,
   with a mean PPV of 78\%-93.1\%, but the voiding reason accuracy varies
   considerably. Conclusion Automated search methods are powerful tools to
   identify WPOE that would otherwise go unnoticed. Further research is
   required around self-identification of errors.},

Abstract = {Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types
   represent categories, generalizing groupoids. A bisimplicial approach to
   directed type theory, developed by Riehl and Shulman, is based on
   equipping each type with both a notion of path and a separate notion of
   directed morphism. In this setting, a directed analogue of the
   univalence axiom asserts that there is a universe of covariant discrete
   fibrations whose directed morphisms correspond to functions-a
   higher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and functions. In
   this paper, we give a constructive model of a directed type theory with
   directed univalence in bicubical, rather than bisimplicial, sets. We
   formalize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a
   1-topos, following Orton and Pitts. First, building on the cubical
   techniques used to give computational models of homotopy type theory, we
   show that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations, with a
   partial directed univalence principle asserting that functions are a
   retract of morphisms in this universe. To complete this retraction into
   an equivalence, we refine the universe of covariant fibrations using the
   constructive sheaf models by Coquand and Ruch.},

Abstract = {In the present work, we propose an active learning framework based on
   optimal query paths to efficiently address the problem of tactile object
   shape exploration. Most previous approaches perform active touch probing
   at discrete query points, which leads to inefficient touch-and-retract
   motions. In contrast, in this paper we propose to query information
   efficient sliding paths instead of only touch locations. This is
   realized by three components: A Gaussian process implicit surface model
   represents the shape and uncertainty of the object. A compliant
   task/force controller framework fuses the information of this GP model
   into the parameterization of its tasks, which enables the robot to slide
   over the unknown object safely and robustly. Thirdly, we develop two
   strategies to solve the proposed active path querying learning problem.
   Sliding along those query paths not only creates more dense data than
   touch probing, but additionally greatly reduces the uncertainty of the
   object. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework both
   in simulation and on the PR2 robot platform. Furthermore, it is shown
   that our methodology can be extended to other learning tasks, such as
   finding a desired surface normal on an unknown object, e.g. for pushing.},

Title = {Comparing Whole Building Energy Implications of Sidelighting Systems
   with Alternate Manual Blind Control Algorithms},

Abstract = {Currently, there is no manual blind control guideline used consistently
   throughout the energy modeling community. This paper identifies and
   compares five manual blind control algorithms with unique control
   patterns and reports blind occlusion, rate of change data, and annual
   building energy consumption. The blind control schemes detailed here
   represent five reasonable candidates for use in lighting and energy
   simulation based on difference driving factors. This study was performed
   on a medium-sized office building using EnergyPlus with the internal
   daylight harvesting engine. Results show that applying manual blind
   control algorithms affects the total annual consumption of the building
   by as much as 12.5\% and 11.5\% for interior and exterior blinds
   respectively, compared to the Always Retracted blinds algorithm. Peak
   demand was also compared showing blind algorithms affected zone load
   sizing by as much as 9.8\%. The alternate algorithms were tested for
   their impact on American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and
   Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guideline 14 calibration metrics and
   all models were found to differ from the original calibrated baseline by
   more than the recommended +/- 15\% for coefficient of variance of the
   mean square error (CVRMSE) and +/- 5\% for normalized mean bias error
   (NMBE). The paper recommends that energy modelers use one or more manual
   blind control algorithms during design stages when making decisions
   about energy efficiency and other design alternatives.},

Abstract = {The Schiff base derived from pyridoxal and 2-aminoethanol was previously
   reported (Anal. Methods 2014, 6, 9610-9614) to be used as a colorimetric
   and fluorescent chemosensor for Ag+ ions in an aqueous solution. We show
   that this Schiff base undergoes fast hydrolysis in an aqueous solution.
   We also report on the failure to reproduce the results of the
   above-mentioned paper related to the discovery of silver(I) ions in an
   aqueous solution using Schiff base of pyridoxal and 2-ami-noethanol as
   chemosensor. The present comment has been initially submitted to the
   Analytical Methods journal, Royal Chemical Society, which published the
   criticized paper in 2014. Later, we received a decision letter about
   rejection of our critical comment, which was justified by the opinion
   that our manuscript contains neither novel information nor new
   interpretation of the results pub-lished previously by the Analytical
   Methods journal. Instead, we just raise concerns in relation to the
   previously published data. The Editorial Office of the Analytical
   Methods journal informed us about the intention to contact the authors
   of the criticized paper and retract the latter if authors would have
   been unable to refute the raised concerns. We would like to note that
   the criticized paper is not still denoted as questionable and is still
   available on the journal page. We believe that the results obtained
   during working on this comment are of interest to the broad scientific
   audience. We appreciate the possibility to initiate the scientific
   discussion on the pages of the ChemChemTech (Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn. Zaved.

Volume = {119},

Abstract = {In recent years, several online tools have appeared capable of
   identifying potential plagiarism in science. While such tools may help
   to maintain or even increase the originality and ethical quality of the
   scientific literature, no apparent consensus exists among editors on the
   degree of plagiarism or self-plagiarism necessary to reject or retract
   manuscripts. In this study, two entire volumes of published original
   papers and reviews from Basic \& Clinical Pharmacology \& Toxicology
   were retrospectively scanned for similarity in anonymized form using
   iThenticate software to explore measures to predictively identify true
   plagiarism and self-plagiarism and to potentially provide guidelines for
   future screening of incoming manuscripts. Several filters were applied,
   all of which appeared to lower the noise from irrelevant hits. The main
   conclusions were that plagiarism software offers a unique opportunity to
   screen for plagiarism easily but also that it has to be employed with
   caution as automated or uncritical use is far too unreliable to allow a
   fair basis for judging the degree of plagiarism in a manuscript. This
   remains the job of senior editors. Whereas a few cases of
   self-plagiarism that would not likely have been accepted with today's
   guidelines were indeed identified, no cases of fraud or serious
   plagiarism were found. Potential guidelines are discussed.},

Title = {A nonmonotonic modal authorization logic for pervasive computing},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1077-1091},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Modal logics have proven invaluable for authorization in distributed
   systems. The logics devised so far, however, are inadequate to meet the
   requirements of pervasive environments. Such environments are, in
   general, characterized as open systems in which computing and
   communication facilities are provided to human users in a dynamic
   manner. These features suggest the need for the modification of existing
   logics in two directions. First, users' capabilities being intrinsic to
   pervasive computing should be incorporated into the underlying modal
   logic. Second, the logic should be equipped with appropriate machinery
   so that it can deal with the imperfection in the information required
   for authorization. This paper has contributions in both directions. We
   present a logic that reflects how the capabilities of users change in
   different contexts. Nonmonotonicity is then added to the logic so that
   earlier decisions based on imperfect information can be retracted. The
   usefulness of our formulation is demonstrated through the added capacity
   it provides for specifying and enforcing access control policies in
   real-life environments. We also present a minimal model semantics that
   reflects nonmonotonicity through the way it gives meaning to the
   formulas of the logic. Finally, we propose a sound and complete decision
   procedure based on semantic tableaux. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \&

Year = {1993},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {197-212},
Month = {APR-SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper we draw on a linguistic model of prosodic structure and a
   task-dynamic model of speech gestures to account for the interplay of
   coarticulation and stress in English. We reinterpret results from two
   experiments in which articulator movements were recorded for utterances
   varying in pitch accent placement. In the first experiment, jaw
   kinematics were studied in post-nuclear unaccented and nuclear accented
   {[}pap] syllables. The kinematic patterns suggested that gestures in
   syllables with greater stress (nuclear accented) show legs
   coarticulatory overlap. By contrast, the vowers low jaw target is
   undershot in unaccented syllables. Two hypotheses are possible. Either
   the jaw is lower in stressed syllables so more energy can radiate from
   the mouth (''sonority expansion'') or the jaw is lower to help
   distinguish the low vowel from other vowels (''hyperarticulation'').
   Another experiment differentiates the two hypotheses by examining tongue
   point positions in {[}put] preceding a {[}o]. In the more stressed
   syllables, the tongue dorsum retracts more, likely to make a more
   distinct back vowel. Also, the amount of assimilation of the alveolar
   stop to the following dental is reduced. Both results suggest
   hyperarticulation rather than sonority expansion. Thus, it seems that
   coarticulation is reduced in stressed syllables, because stressed
   syllables are hyperarticulated.},

Volume = {874},
Pages = {756-773},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {This paper is dedicated to the solidification of a water drop impacting
   a cold solid surface. In the first part, we establish a one-dimensional
   (1-D) solidification model, derived from the Stefan problem, that aims
   at predicting the freezing dynamics of a liquid on a cold substrate,
   taking into account the thermal properties of this substrate. This model
   is then experimentally validated through a 1-D solidification set-up,
   using different liquids and substrates. In the second part, we show that
   during the actual drop spreading, a thin layer of ice develops between
   the water and the substrate and pins the contact line at its edge when
   the drop reaches its maximal diameter. The liquid film then remains
   still on the ice and keeps freezing. This configuration lasts until the
   contact line eventually unpins and the liquid film retracts on the ice.
   We measure and interpret this crucial time of freezing during which the
   main ice layer is built. Finally, we compare our 1-D model prediction to
   the thickness of this ice pancake and we find a very good agreement.
   This allows us to provide a general expression for the frozen drop's
   main thickness, using the drop's impact and liquid parameters.},

Abstract = {For lunar surface exploration, a deployment system is necessary to allow
   a rover to leave the lander. The system should be as lightweight as
   possible and stored retracted when launched. In this paper, two types of
   retractable deployment systems for lunar landing missions, telescopic-
   and fold-type ramps, are discussed. In the telescopic type system, a
   ramp is stored with the sections overlapping and slides out during
   deployment. In the fold-type system, it is stored folded and unfolds for
   the deployment. For the development of these ramps, a design concept
   study and structural analysis were conducted first. Subsequently, ramp
   deployment and rover release tests were performed using the developed
   ramp prototypes. Through these tests, the validity of their design
   concepts and functions have been confirmed. In the rover release test,
   it was observed that the developed lightweight ramp was sufficiently
   strong for a 50-kg rover to descend. This result suggests that this ramp
   system is suitable for the deployment of a 300-kg-class rover on the
   Moon, where the gravity is about one-sixth that on Earth. The
   lightweight and sturdy ramp developed in this study will contribute to
   both safe rover deployment and increase of lander/rover payload.},

Title = {The effect of volunteering upon volunteers' Christian faith: Food
   poverty and holiday hunger},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {119},
Pages = {52-60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Volunteers have been increasingly important in responding to rising UK
   poverty in the last decade in the context of austerity and the
   retracting welfare state. Faith-based organisations in particular have
   played a vital role in this response but whilst there has been attention
   to how religious faith can motivate people to volunteer, this paper is
   one of the first geographical pieces to specifically focus on how
   volunteers' religious faith is affected by volunteering. Inspired by the
   geographies of religion, it conceptualises faith as fluid and
   relational. This means faith cannot only be understood as a motivation
   at the start of volunteering, and therefore how faith is affected by
   volunteering needs to be understood. This paper is based on the
   experiences of volunteers at a participatory research project `Lunch'
   responding to UK children's holiday hunger. Engaging with volunteers'
   journeys at Lunch drew out two dominant ways in which volunteers'
   religious faith was affected: encouragement and challenge from
   volunteering at a faith-based project without explicit faith content,
   and secondly, the challenge of giving an unconditional welcome to
   volunteers and children at Lunch. Overall, I argue that whilst religious
   faith can motivate people to volunteer, this is not a unidirectional
   relationship because volunteers' faith can also be challenged by their
   experiences which can not only affect their motivations and whether they
   will persist in volunteering, but can also fundamentally change their
   understanding of their religious faith.},

Title = {Green investment under time-dependent subsidy retraction risk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS \& CONTROL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {SI},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Driven by ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions many
   countries have introduced support schemes to accelerate investments in
   renewable energy. However, in recent years experience showed that, over
   time, retraction of support schemes becomes more likely. This has a
   severe effect on investment behaviour. In this paper we study the effect
   of a potential subsidy retraction of a feed-in tariff(FIT) on investment
   in renewable energy capacity, where we explicitly account for the fact
   that the likelihood of policy retraction may change over time. We show
   that the range of FITs, for which it is optimal to invest immediately,
   decreases the longer a subsidy has been in place. If the FIT offered is
   too small and/or the subsidy has been installed too long ago, it is
   optimal for the firm to wait with investment until the subsidy is
   eventually retracted and free market conditions prove to be profitable
   enough. Furthermore, we show that whether a policy maker aiming at
   accelerating investment prefers investors to consider retraction risk to
   be time-dependent or not, depends on how much time has passed since the
   subsidy has been introduced at the moment the investor considers
   investment for the first time. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Accommodating difference in the prehistoric past: Revisiting the case of
   Romito 2 from a bioarchaeology of care perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PALEOPATHOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {64-74},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The remains of Romito 2 (probable male, 17-20 years) date to around
   11,000 BP and represent the earliest known case of chondrodystrophic
   dwarfism (acromesomelic dysplasia). From a hunter-gatherer community in
   a mountainous region of southern Italy, Romito 2's skeletal dysplasia
   limited his participation in typical economic and other cultural
   activities undertaken by his cohort, and anomalies in appearance
   distinguished him from his peers from infancy onwards. Frayer et al.
   (1987) were first to describe Romito 2 in detail, suggesting survival to
   age-at-death indicates group support. Four years later Dettwyler (1991)
   challenged this conclusion and, a decade after this, Frayer retracted
   the original claim for care (Bower, 2002). Using the Index of Care
   (Tilley and Cameron, 2014), this study revisits Romito 2 from a
   bioarchaeology of care perspective to ascertain whether a valid basis
   for inferring caregiving exists. Concluding Frayer et al. (1987) were
   right the first time - that Romito 2's survival reflects caregiving in
   the form of `accommodation of difference' - this contribution argues
   that focus on contemporary context is the key to estimating functional
   impact of pathology and related need for care. This paper also briefly
   considers ethical concerns raised by archaeology's treatment of Romito
   2's remains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Impact of maximum sustainable yield on mutualistic communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {230},
Pages = {63-72},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {We analyze effects of reaching the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in a
   system of n cooperating logistic populations under proportional
   harvesting strategy. In case a selective harvesting effort adjusted to
   each species is implemented, the optimum effort is smaller than half the
   biotic potential of each species. This results in the total maximum
   sustainable yield (TMSY1) which does not affect the persistence of the
   system. In case the system is harvested with a common harvesting effort
   which is approximately the same for all cooperating species, like in a
   trawler fishing, the optimum harvesting effort leads to the TMSY2, where
   TMSY1 >= TMSY2. In addition, species with lower biotic potential and
   carrying capacity may be driven to extinction, especially if these
   species weakly cooperate with the rest of the system. Hence, a call for
   implementation of TMSY2 may be equivalent to a call for extermination of
   some species, and it runs against the Convention on Biological Diversity
   (CBD, 1992). Since the documents advocating MSY, starting with the
   Johannesburg Implementation plan (IP, 2002) and including the EU Green
   Paper (EU, 2009), use TMSY2, the call for MSY must be urgently retracted
   and replaced with a call for adaptive management that respects CBD. (C)

Title = {Disruption Recovery in Passenger Railways International Survey},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2013},
Number = {2353},
Pages = {22-32},
Abstract = {This research paper explores the manner in which passenger rail transit
   organizations plan for and manage unplanned service disruptions through
   an international survey of practices. The research reported here
   included semistructured interviews of those staff responsible for
   service disruption management within 71 international transit agencies.
   Results suggested that 20\% of agencies had parallel transit systems
   that could be used by commuters whose service was disrupted. Most of
   these systems existed in inner-city contexts. Track intrusions, medical
   emergencies, weather extremes, and track and rolling stock failures were
   common causes of unplanned disruptions. Bus bridging was the most common
   response to line blockages, while transfer of passengers to the next
   train was the most common approach to individual rolling stock failures.
   Track crossovers were widely seen as critical to manage responses to
   disruptions. A small minority, mostly in cold climates, also saw
   crossovers as a cause of unplanned failures. Most agencies used spare
   buses as bus-bridging vehicles. Only 45\% actively retracted buses from
   existing scheduled bus services. Some of these agencies did acknowledge
   that retraction often was done in extenuating circumstances, however.
   Rarely did agencies have a strategic reserve of buses for bus-bridging
   purposes. This paper discusses the implications of the study findings
   for further research and practice. This paper also documents that all
   responses to unplanned disruptions can be categorized according to the
   key disruption characteristics of duration, cause, time, and location,
   and it provides a typology of response mechanisms on the basis of such
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Surgery of the inguinal canal is very common in infancy. Occasionally,
   injury of the bladder may occur with severe consequences. The aim of
   this paper was to warn young surgeons of this serious complication.
   During the last 2 years, we observed four cases of bladder injury
   following surgery on inguinal canal. All were males. The indication for
   surgery was inguinal hernia in three patients and cryptorchidism in one
   patient.
   Two cases presented with urinary peritonitis. One child was referred
   later for a retracted bladder with reflux. In one child, the lesion was
   promptly recognized and repaired. Of the four cases, two ruptures of the
   bladder caused transient sequaele, i.e. persisting catheter drainage,
   and voiding disorders later. In two cases, there were serious
   consequences: the bladder had to be partially removed in one child,
   ending up in temporary ureterostomy and subsequent reconstruction with
   bladder augmentation. The fourth child developed a small, water
   clock-shaped bladder with a thick wedge of scarred tissue, and bilateral
   ureteral reimplantation with bladder augmentation was necessary.
   Surgery of the inguinal canal is very common in children and infants,
   and is often performed by trainees. Awareness of this serious event
   should be emphasized in training programs.},

Abstract = {Using the Digital Pulsed Force Mode (DPFM) approach, the local
   mechanical properties of living HeLa cells have been examined. The cells
   were attached to a favorable glass-like substrate. The AFM used for the
   experiments was a commercial AFM setup by WITec. At every point of the
   image, approach and retract curves have been performed. The repetition
   rate of the cycle was 175 Hz. A total of about 500,000 curves has been
   recorded and completely evaluated for each experiment. The substrate
   served as an online reference material for calibration purposes. First,
   the force trajectories were corrected for the viscous drag force in the
   liquid environment. Second, the curves within the region of the
   substrate were phase corrected to compensate for the time lag of the
   signal in the setup assuming a purely elastic response of the reference
   material. Finally, all the force traces have been corrected by using
   this information and evaluated according to common continuum-elastic
   models. The resulting images allow the assignment of values of Young's
   modulus, local adhesion, hysteretic behavior, etc. at a high lateral
   resolution all over the cell body. In this paper, we describe the
   procedure of our measurement and the corresponding signal correction
   strategy of our automated data evaluation.},

Abstract = {Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has gained popularity in current
   abdominal surgical procedures due to its reduced skin incision length,
   shortened recovery time and decreased postoperative complications. One
   trend is to enhance these benefits by developing technologies to expand
   the application of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) which has
   even less incision and incision-related complication. However, the
   practical application of SILS has been constrained by many complexities,
   including fundamental procedure issues (e. g. limited space), as well as
   the issues related to surgical tools, such as lack of actuation force,
   weak tool tips, poor visualization and lack of dexterous multitasking
   tools. Due to this lack of multitasking tools, the surgical tools or
   robots have to be retracted, exchanged and reset multiple times during
   the surgery, increasing the surgical time, the risk of injury and the
   surgeon's level of fatigue. This paper focuses on developing a
   multifunctional manipulator with an automatic tool changing capability
   to boost practical application of SILS. The manipulator uses a
   wire-driven method that minimizes the potential damage from
   sterilization since the electronic actuation and sensing components are
   located remotely from the end-effector which needs heat or chemical
   sterilization before surgery. The feasibility of the tool tip changing
   method has been demonstrated by experiments.},

Title = {A viscous switch for liquid-liquid dewetting},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},

Month = {JAN 23},
Abstract = {The spontaneous dewetting of a liquid film from a solid surface occurs
   in many important processes, such as printing and microscale patterning.
   Experience suggests that dewetting occurs faster on surfaces of higher
   film repellency. Here, we show how, unexpectedly, a surrounding viscous
   phase can switch the overall dewetting speed so that films retract
   slower with increasing surface repellency. We present experiments and a
   hydrodynamic theory covering five decades of the viscosity ratio between
   the film and the surrounding phase. The timescale of dewetting is
   controlled by the geometry of the liquid-liquid interface close to the
   contact line and the viscosity ratio. At small viscosity ratio,
   dewetting is slower on low film-repellency surfaces due to a high
   dissipation at the edge of the receding film. This situation is reversed
   at high viscosity ratios, leading to a slower dewetting on high
   film-repellency surfaces due to the increased dissipation of the
   advancing surrounding phase.
   It is generally accepted that the speed of dewetting increases with the
   repellency of the substrate to the dewetting liquid, and decreases at
   high surrounding liquid viscosity. This paper demonstrates
   experimentally and theoretically the existence of an unexpected
   viscosity regime where dewetting becomes quicker on less repellent
   substrates.},

Volume = {30},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Some patients have no chance of surviving if not treated, but very
   little chance if treated. A number of medical ethicists and physicians
   have argued that treatment in such cases is medically futile and a
   matter of physician discretion. This paper critically examines that
   position.
   According to Howard Brody and others, a judgment of medical futility is
   a purely technical matter, which physicians are uniquely qualified to
   make. Although Brody later retracted these claims, he held to the view
   that physicians need not consult the patient or his family to determine
   their values before deciding not to treat. This is because professional
   integrity dictates that treatment should not be undertaken. The argument
   for this claim is that medicine is a profession and a social practice,
   and thus capable of breaches of professional integrity.
   Underlying professional integrity are two moral principles, one
   concerning harm, the other fraud. According to Brody both point to the
   fact that when the odds of survival are very low treatment is a
   violation of professional integrity.
   The details of this skeletal argument are exposed and explained, and the
   full argument is criticised. On a number of counts, it is found wanting.
   If anything, professional integrity points to the opposite conclusion.},

Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {Since its beginnings, modern bodybuilding has been accompanied by the
   background issue of whether it should be considered a sport. The
   problem, culminating in its provisional acceptance as a sport by the
   International Olympic Committee, was later retracted. The uncertainty of
   whether bodybuilding is a sport or not seems to linger. Addressing this
   issue, Aranyosi (2018) provided an account to determine the status of
   bodybuilding as a sport that arrives at the negative answer:
   bodybuilding is not a sport but rather a form of artistic presentation.
   In this paper, we disagree with Aranyosi. We argue that by the standards
   he presents in his first argument, bodybuilding should be considered a
   sport. Further, we argue that his alternative approach on how to
   evaluate a discipline as more sport- or art-like on a spectrum, is not a
   valid basis to make such a judgment regarding bodybuilding. Further,
   even if his spectrum was modified to enable such a judgment, again it
   would result in bodybuilding being evaluated as a sport. Therefore, we
   conclude that everyone who accepts Aranyosi \& PRIME;s (or any less
   restrictive) requirements to decide whether bodybuilding is a sport, has
   to consider bodybuilding as a sport or refrain from making claims about
   its status.},

Title = {The Tantalum Metals (1801-1866): Nineteenth-Century Analytical Chemistry
   and the Identification of Chemical Elements},
Journal = {AMBIX},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Number = {4},

Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {This paper examines the identification of chemical elements using
   mineral analysis, focusing on the controversy surrounding the ``tantalum
   metals{''} between 18o1 and 1866. Of these metals, only tantalum and
   niobium are still recognised as elements today; the discovery claims of
   columbium, pelopium, ilmenium and dianium were all retracted or refuted.
   Despite the theoretical and institutional changes that chemistry
   underwent during this time, the debates on the tantalum metals point
   towards a continuity in the identification of metals. For most of the
   nineteenth century, chemists continued to use the same types of
   analytical procedures as their mid-eighteenth-century predecessors.
   These analytical methods enabled the identification of metals based on
   the chemical behaviour of their compounds, without requiring their
   isolation in the form of simple substances (that is, as metals).
   Accordingly, the central questions in all of the debates on the tantalum
   metals were the correct identification of the properties of compounds
   and the elimination of impurities, rather than the simplicity of the new
   metals. The story of the tantalum metals therefore illustrates the fact
   that, despite the definition of chemical elements as simple substances,
   the discovery of new (metallic) elements only rarely coincided with the
   isolation of new simple substances.},

Abstract = {Energy dissipation during the motion of droplet in the microfluidic
   system depends on the adhesion behaviors between droplet and the
   micro-channel. However, the ``quasi-dynamic{''} droplet/soft substrate
   interfacial behaviors during wetting, stretching and separation has not
   got enough attention. In this paper, the adhesion behaviors between
   droplet and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film were studied by an adhesion
   test device and the role of substrate deformation in the adhesion
   behaviors has been discussed. Results showed that the droplet/ PDMS film
   adhesion force consisted of a snap-in force, a maximum force and a
   pull-off force. The snap-in force increased with increasing of the
   elastic modulus of the PDMS film. However, the maximum force and the
   pull-off force decreased as the elastic modulus of the PDMS film
   enhanced. Moreover, the snap-in force, the maximum force and the
   pull-off force increased with increasing of droplet volume and
   retracting velocity. It is indicated that the interactional behaviors
   between droplet and soft PDMS during wetting, stretching and separation
   were closely associated with the adhesion parameters and the elastic
   modulus of the PDMS film. The findings are helpful to optimizing the
   mechanical properties of the PDMS micro-channel in the microfluidic
   system and can further enrich the liquid/solid interfacial adhesion
   theory.},

Abstract = {This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development of a
   hydraulic demonstrator used to illustrate simple mechanical and
   electrical concepts to high school and undergraduate students. The
   system utilizes a remote controller which communicates with a
   microcontroller, used to open and close electrically controlled valves
   allowing fluid to transfer, extending and retracting hydraulic
   cylinders. Once actuated, each hydraulic cylinder will rotate individual
   components of the mechanical arm to mimic the motion of typical industry
   standard excavating equipment. This arm is composed of a unique
   multi-layered Lexan design permitting the system to be transparent. One
   major advantage of this transparent design is having a demonstrator
   which allows students to easily observe fluid power systems, their
   functions, and the mechanics of the arm. The arm is assembled using
   quick disconnect pins making the mechanical arm easy to assemble and
   disassemble for storage and portability purposes. This allows the arm to
   be used in a wide range of learning settings, including outreach
   opportunities, recruiting events, and classrooms, where it can be used
   to teach multiple concepts using a variety of different laboratory
   experiments. The courses that would benefit from this demonstrator range
   from, but are not limited to, fundamental engineering courses such as
   statics and dynamics or advanced courses such as fluid power and data
   acquisition courses.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of a
   decode-and-forward relay network with wireless energy harvesting. The
   data transmission between a multi-antenna base station (BS) and its user
   equipment is assisted by an intermediate relay node, which operates with
   the wireless energy harvesting. The BS firstly transmits energy and
   information to the relay node, which can harvest the energy and retract
   the information simultaneously using the power-splitting or
   time-switching method. Then, the relay node forwards its decoded
   information to the user equipment using all the harvested energy.
   Through maximising the instantaneous EE for the power-splitting-based
   system, the optimal power-splitting ratio and the optimal transmit power
   of the BS are derived in closed form for each time block. To maximise
   the instantaneous EE for the time-switching-based system, an
   optimisation algorithm is proposed to judiciously determine the
   harvesting time and the transmit power of the BS for each time block.
   Furthermore, we optimise the number of antennas N of the BS by taking
   into account the circuit power consumption, as it cannot be ignored when
   N is large. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate our
   derived closed-form solutions and verify the efficiency of our proposed
   algorithm. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Previous experimental work has shown that the spreading of a drop of
   aqueous anionic surfactant solution on a liquid film supported by a
   negatively charged solid substrate may give rise to a fingering
   instability (Afsar-Siddiqui, A. B.; Luckham P, F.; Matar, O. K. Langmuir
   2003,19, 703-708). However, upon deposition of a cationic surfactant on
   a similarly charged support, the surfactant will adsorb onto the
   solid-liquid interface rendering it hydrophobic. Water is then expelled
   from the hydrophobic regions, causing film rupture and dewetting. In
   this paper, experimental results are presented showing how the
   surfactant concentration and film thickness affect the dewetting
   behavior of aqueous dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide solutions. At low
   surfactant concentrations and large film thicknesses, the film ruptures
   at a point from which dewetting proceeds. At higher concentrations and
   smaller film thicknesses, the ruptured region is annular in shape and
   fluid moves away from this region. At still higher concentrations and
   smaller film thicknesses, the deposited surfactant forms a cap at the
   point of deposition that neither spreads nor retracts. This variation in
   dewetting mode is explained by considering the relative Marangoni and
   bulk diffusion time scales as well as the mode of assembly of the
   surfactant adsorbed on the solid surface.},

Title = {Three-Terminal Nanometer Metal Switches Utilizing Solid Electrolytes},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN},

Volume = {94},

Pages = {55-61},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We propose a three-terminal nanometer metal switch that utilizes a solid
   electrolyte where a nanoscale metal filament is stretched and retracted.
   Its operating principle is based on electrochemical reaction and ion
   migration in the electrolyte. The fabricated device is composed of a
   solid electrolyte layer (Cu2S), a gate (Cu), a source (Cu), and a drain
   (Pt). After the Cu filament is formed between the source and the drain
   by applying the drain voltage, repeatable on/off switching in the drain
   current is obtained by controlling the gate voltage. The on/off current
   ratio can be as high as 10(5), and the programmable cycle is around 50.
   Each state can be kept for up to 40 days. Since the gate is separated
   from the current path, the switching current can be reduced to 10 mu A,
   which is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of a two-terminal
   switch. In this paper, we present the operating principle and electrical
   characteristics of the three-terminal switches, and discuss how suitable
   they are for reconfigurable circuits. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {To keep pace with the increasing demand for higher throughput, lower
   cost per unit and tighter specifications, manufacturers of fiber optic
   devices are now looking towards a new generation of automated alignment
   tools. The ``ideal{''} alignment tool has six degrees-of-freedom (DOF),
   (X, Y, Z, Yaw, Pitch, Roll) repeatability better than 50 nanometers,
   travel greater than 10 millimeters and is fully automated. In this paper
   we describe the use of INCHWORM (R) motor technology to produce a new
   ``nano-robotic{''} system that demonstrates a major advancement toward
   the ``ideal{''} photonics alignment tool. The INCHWORM actuator is
   uniquely suited to provide nanometer resolution movements over tens of
   millimeters of range with very high stiffness and stability. The
   ``clamp-extend-clamp-retract{''} stepping sequence produces direct
   linear motion with no backlash. INCHWORM motors are integrated in cross
   roller bearing stages to achieve 20 nanometer and 0.1 are second
   closed-loop resolution. The high stiffness and stability of the
   solid-state piezoelectric actuators hold position to a single
   ``count{''} on a glass scale encoder while generating zero heat.
   Mounting fixtures hold optical elements so that their geometric centers
   coincide with the virtual point of rotation. Active alignment processes
   for selected photonics components, as well as intensity maps of
   components are presented.},

Abstract = {In the present information age, there's been an increase in the use of
   social media, as a result, there have been multiple cyberbullying
   instances. To prevent or reduce cyberbullying, many existing approaches
   in the literature incorporate normal Machine Learning and Natural
   Language Processing text classification models without considering the
   sentence semantics. In this paper, we aim to target that issue. We have
   used word2vec to train our custom word embeddings upon which we built
   our LSTM - CNN architecture and finally it was trained on it. We made a
   comparative study of the above approaches by testing our model on
   Twitter posts and comments. The eminent performance achieved by our
   method has been observed in this study. We also created a web
   application that used the model to classify tweets as cyberbullying or
   not based on the toxicity score along with various features. The model
   was also implemented on Telegram Bot which is used to check and prevent
   cyberbullying. Two Chrome Extensions were built to redact and retract
   Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content and prevent cyberbullying on WhatsApp
   Web. We have been able to achieve excellent performance in the form of a
   97\% ROC AUC score for our model.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a 3D numerical model of Wire Arc Additive
   Manufacturing to simulate the material deposition and the temperature
   field from the operating parameters. This predictive model, applied to a
   Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) process, takes into account electromagnetism,
   fluid flow and heat transfer in all domains (wire, arc, melt pool,
   substrate). This model, developed using COMSOL Multiphysics (R)
   software, calculates the creation of the molten metal drop at the filler
   wire tip, the detachment of the drop when the filler material retracts
   during the short circuiting phase and the growth of the deposit. This
   innovative work describes for the first time the wire behaviour
   dynamically and its interaction with the melt pool in 3D in a fully
   coupled approach. The dynamics of the free surface are treated with the
   level set method, particularly efficient for strong topological changes.
   The Lorentz forces, shear stress, arc pressure, and Joule effect are
   calculated. This model requires only the knowledge of the operating
   parameters without any assumption on the arc distribution. It aims to
   simulate the build-up of a 304 stainless steel wall. To validate this
   model, the melt pool dimensions and shape of the deposit calculated for
   the first layer are compared to experimental data given by macrographs
   and high speed videos.},

Abstract = {Ockham's razor is the principle that, all other things being equal,
   scientists ought to prefer simpler theories In recent years,
   philosophers have argued that simpler theories make better predictions,
   possess theoretical virtues like explanatory power, and have other
   pragmatic virtues like computational tractability However, such
   arguments fail to explain how and why a preference for simplicity can
   help one find true theories in scientific inquiry, unless one already
   assumes that the truth is simple One new solution to that problem is the
   Ockham efficiency theorem (Kelly 2002, Minds Mach 14 485-505, 2004,
   Philos Sci 74 561-573, 2007a, b, Theor Comp Sci 383 270-289, c, d, Kelly
   and Glymour 2004), which states that scientists who heed Ockham's razor
   retract their opinions less often and sooner than do their non-Ockham
   competitors The theorem neglects, however, to consider competitors
   following random ({''}mixed{''}) strategies and in many applications
   random strategies are known to achieve better worst-case loss than
   deterministic strategies In this paper, we describe two ways to extend
   the result to a very general class of random, empirical strategies The
   first extension concerns expected retractions, retraction times, and
   errors and the second extension concerns retractions in chance, times of
   retractions in chance, and chances of errors},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a 3-D localization method for a magnetically
   actuated soft capsule endoscope (MASCE). The proposed localization
   scheme consists of three steps. First, MASCE is oriented to be coaxially
   aligned with an external permanent magnet (EPM). Second, MASCE is
   axially contracted by the enhanced magnetic attraction of the
   approaching EPM. Third, MASCE recovers its initial shape by the
   retracting EPM as the magnetic attraction weakens. The combination of
   the estimated direction in the coaxial alignment step and the estimated
   distance in the shape deformation (recovery) step provides the position
   of MASCE in 3-D. It is experimentally shown that the proposed
   localization method could provide 2.0-3.7 mm of distance error in 3-D.
   This study also introduces two new applications of the proposed
   localization method. First, based on the trace of contact points between
   the MASCE and the surface of the stomach, the 3-D geometrical model of a
   synthetic stomach was reconstructed. Next, the relative tissue
   compliance at each local contact point in the stomach was characterized
   by measuring the local tissue deformation at each point due to the
   preloading force. Finally, the characterized relative tissue compliance
   parameter was mapped onto the geometrical model of the stomach toward
   future use in disease diagnosis.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative reconstruction of the European late
   Pleistocene paleoclimate based on 72 rodent assemblages of five
   sequences from France, Germany and Bulgaria, covering the last
   interglacial-glacial cycle. They show a pattern of severe changes in
   temperature, with reduced precipitation during the coldest periods. A
   tentative correlation between the isotopic and palynological records and
   the paleotemperature changes is shown. These changes are consistent with
   variations in atmospheric circulation patterns in response to an
   expanding-retracting Fennoscandian ice-sheet. They can be attributed to
   the enhancement-weakening of the Scandinavian-Polar anticyclone and its
   associated dry winds, the south-north shifting of the North Atlantic
   Polar Front, and the varying supply of moist air from the Atlantic.
   Qualitative paleoenvironmental analysis shows broadleaved-deciduous
   forests in France and Bulgaria during most of the Studied period. Taiga
   and tundra appeared in eastern France during the lower Wurm. The German
   sequence indicates the presence of coniferous forests. These results are
   broadly consistent with other paleobiological records (mammalian, avian
   and insect faunas, isotopic record in dental tissue, palynology). The
   main discrepancies with the paleoclimate inferred from the palynological
   record are found during the coldest periods and are probably due to the
   interaction between vegetation, climate, and atmospheric CO2 levels. (c)

Abstract = {This paper describes the feasibility analyses of an innovative,
   extensible `smart' blade technology aims to significantly improve the
   wind turbine energy production. This innovative `smart' blade will be
   extended at low wind speed to harvest more wind energy. It will be
   retracted to its original shape above rated wind speed, to protect the
   blade from possible damages under high wind speed. The extended blade,
   however, will inevitably increase the fatigue damage of the wind turbine
   blade of which fatigue demand, which often controls the design
   requirement of wind turbine blade. A rain-flow counting method is used
   for calculating stress range cycles during turbine blade operation. The
   analyzes model in the research is built based on a 100 kW utility-scale
   wind turbine installed on the campus of Case Western Reserve University
   with a data acquisition system installed on the wind turbine tower to
   monitor the operation data continuously over the years. In this
   analyses, the data set consists of four years' wind speed data at
   10-minutes time interval and blade rotational speed from March 2014 to
   February 2015 have been used. The results show that the fatigue damage
   of this extensible blade increased is acceptable considering its
   increased power output.},

   MBZIRC 2020 and is primarily focused on the task of assembling large 3D
   structures in outdoors and GPS-denied environments. Primary
   contributions of this system are: (i) a novel computationally efficient
   deep learning based unified multi-task visual perception system for
   target localization, part segmentation, and tracking, (ii) a novel deep
   learning based grasp state estimation, (iii) a retracting
   electromagnetic gripper design, (iv) a remote computing approach which
   exploits state-of-the-art MIMO based high speed (5000Mb/s) wireless
   links to allow the UAVs to execute compute intensive tasks on remote
   high end compute servers, and (v) system integration in which several
   system components are weaved together in order to develop an optimized
   software stack. We use DJI Matrice-600 Pro, a hexrotor UAV and interface
   it with the custom designed gripper. Our framework is deployed on the
   specified UAV in order to report the performance analysis of the
   individual modules. Apart from the manipulation system, we also
   highlight several hidden challenges associated with the UAVs in this

Abstract = {The women's college gymnasium's geographical, architectural and

   in the social constitution of the gendered body. It has provided a
   critical stage on which struggles within the profession of physical
   education and its relation to competitive sport have been enacted both
   within its own boundaries and at the level of the broader campus and its
   shifting priorities. This paper explores the rise and demise of women's
   gymnasia on North American college campuses from the late nineteenth to
   the latter decades of the twentieth century to illuminate how the
   shifting academic landscape has reflected changing attitudes towards the
   perceived needs of female students and the nature of their training in
   physical education and movement sciences. The analysis focuses upon two
   women's colleges in the United States remarkable for their architectural
   splendour and programme integrity: the University of California at
   Berkeley's Phoebe Apperson Hearst Memorial Gymnasium for Women and the
   Anna Hiss Gymnasium at the University of Texas, Austin. It laments their
   gradual demise as academic institutions have increasingly shifted their
   priorities and the world of the female gymnasium has retracted to be
   reinserted into college campuses' twenty-first century vision for
   student recreation and competitive sport.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1254-1272},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article describes the regularities in the use of the Finnish
   conjunctions ja ('and') and mutta ('but') as turn-final particles in
   ordinary conversation. The data is analyzed using conversation analytic
   and interactional linguistic methods. The basic observation discussed in
   this article is that as final particles, the words ja and mutta
   recurrently occur as parts of fixed, two-part discourse patterns. In the
   case of ja ('and'), the discourse pattern consists of a general claim
   and a specifying list that ends in ja. This list-final ja implies that
   the list is not exhaustive but only exemplifies the earlier claim. On
   the other hand, mutta ('but') occurs at the end of the concessive turns
   that are used to retract some earlier claim by the same speaker. By
   using the turn-final mutta, the speaker implies that the earlier claim
   still holds - despite the retraction. This paper argues that the
   identification of the recurrent discourse patterns helps to explain the
   functions and the recognizability of conjunctions as final particles.
   The discourse patterns described in the article may be seen as reduced
   versions of highly predictable, larger patterns in which the obvious
   continuation is left implicit, with the conjunction occurring in final
   position. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Degema is an Edoid language of Nigeria whose ten vowels are organized
   phonologically into two sets of five. The two sets are thought to be
   differentiated by the degree of tongue root advancing. This paper
   examines the acoustic nature of these vowels as represented in field
   recordings of six speakers, The most consistent acoustic correlate of
   the tongue root contrast was found to be the first formant frequency
   which consistently distinguishes four of the five vowel pairs, the
   exception being the two low vowels. Three of the five pairs could also
   be distinguished by F-2, though the direction of the difference was not
   consistent. Additionally, a comparison of corresponding advanced and
   retracted vowels using a normalized measure of relative formant
   intensity demonstrated that this correlate could also distinguish them
   in general, but only operated reliably in two of the five vowel pairs.
   The pair of low vowels could not be distinguished From each other by any
   of these measures. Finally, a perceptual study was conducted which
   demonstrates that Degema speakers do not classify their vowels very well
   using formant frequencies as the sole acoustic variable; only the two
   pairs of mid vowels were reliably singled out by native listeners from
   an array of synthesized vowels.},

Abstract = {A touch-based probe of a coordinate measurement machine (CMM) is
   generally used to validate the dimensions of the artifacts and
   associated features which come out of the manufacturing line against its
   dimensions to ensure to be within prescribed GD\&T {[}Wilson 14] limits.
   Although there could be other applications using a CMM like reverse
   engineering, however the stated inspection process is quite crucial for
   maintaining quality factor and to regulate merits of the manufacturing
   process especially with the continuous wear-tear of the involved
   tooling. However this inspection process, which is considered as
   auxiliary process, needs to have minimum cycle time in order to
   effectively have more quality units to be produced.
   In this paper we describe Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) in
   order to complete Computer Aided Inspection (CAI) process using CMM on
   the work-piece which is created through Computer Aided Design (CAD) and
   Manufacturing (CAM). This leads to Computer Integrated Manufacturing
   (CIM) process. As a result, the features, which need to be inspected,
   could be recognized from its corresponding CAD file and appropriate
   information could be culled out by the Dassault Software System to
   calculate the approach and retract points to inspect the features
   {[}Choudhury 03].
   The main objective of this research paper is to determine the shortest
   collision free trajectory from the retract point of one feature being
   inspected to the approach point of another feature being inspected so
   that the sequencing for the set of trajectories could be calculated
   through existing Traveling Sales Person (TSP) algorithm in order to
   shorten the total distance travelled by the CMM probe, which in turn
   would linearly reflect in reducing the cycle inspection time. Further
   since different features in the work-piece might need to be inspected by
   different probes, an overhead time and displacement for probe change,
   needs to consider in order to shorten the cycle time. These include
   clustering of similar type of features, which can be inspected by the
   same probe. Also clustering of similar type of features need to be
   assessed against spatial distance of separation between the clusters
   that the probe has to travel. Since the CMM travels at a constant low
   speed and the different probes are of similar shape, size and
   comparatively very small weight, the motion dynamics of the CMM does not
   influence the total distance travelled for the inspection process.
   Our main contribution is in the development of a spatial algorithm which
   not only reduces the inter-feature distance but also does that by
   avoiding the potential for any collision with the feature or the
   artifact without the use of any computer vision or collision avoidance
   sensor information. The resulting spatial algorithm has implicit
   embedded information of feature clustering, which when fed into an
   optimization algorithm generates a path planning which would eventually
   shorten the cycle time. The illustration is done with two separate
   simulations.},

Abstract = {A Service-Level Agreement (SLA) provides surety for specific quality
   attributes to the consumers of services. However, current SLAs offered
   by cloud infrastructure providers do not address response time, which,
   from the user's point of view, is the most important quality attribute
   for Web applications. Satisfying a maximum average response time
   guarantee for Web applications is difficult for two main reasons: first,
   traffic patterns are highly dynamic and difficult to predict accurately;
   second, the complex nature of multi-tier Web applications increases the
   difficulty of identifying bottlenecks and resolving them automatically.
   This paper proposes a methodology and presents a working prototype
   system for automatic detection and resolution of bottlenecks in a
   multi-tier Web application hosted on a cloud in order to satisfy

   for identifying and retracting over-provisioned resources in multi-tier

Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},

Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {493-517},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper presents a method for validating safety systems with several
   components. A fall arrest system for billposters is one example. It
   includes a Canadian Standards Association certified harness, shock
   absorber and self-retracting lanyard, a hand-made hook, a horizontal
   lifeline and noncertified anchorage. Since no regulations exist for
   verifying a multi-component assembly made up of certified and hand-made
   components, we present a method for verifying a multi-component system.
   The verification applies the limit states design method. By applying the
   concepts of this method to fall arrest systems, resistance and
   performance requirements can be differentiated. Dynamic strength tests
   maximize the impact forces in the assembly in order to determine the
   strength of the assembly; these tests are performed using a rigid
   compact mass attached to a wire rope lanyard. They therefore verify the
   ultimate limit states. Dynamic performance tests are carried out by
   reproducing the actual conditions of use as closely as possible, only
   the person is replaced by a rigid torso. They verify the serviceability
   limit states. Only the total fall distance is verified. This distinction
   between dynamic strength and performance tests enables to identify the
   proper dynamic drop tests that must be performed in certifying
   components or an assembly. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Indian railways is growing at a healthy rate and the government is
   taking initiatives to become the third largest railway market in the
   next five years. However there exists a growing concern over the waste
   disposal and management system adopted, calling for an immediate
   solution. With a major section of our Indian Railways relying on manual
   scavenging as a current solution, advances in Robotics and Automation
   calls for a more robust and effective system design that could call an
   end to the unhygienic conditions the manual scavengers are subject to
   and also ensure a cleaner railway network. The proposed autonomous
   railway track cleaning bot makes use of specially designed retractable
   wheels, an optimized height adjustable sweeper roller, chlorination
   unit, bot retracting mechanism and GPS-GSM module interfaced via AT
   commands. The problem was approached by kinematic and dynamic modelling
   along with the required static structural analysis of the bot. This
   paper is aims at provide a solution to the menace caused by littered
   waste taking into consideration the rail traffic that prevails along
   certain lines. This work would serve a cost effective yet time and
   life-saving solution to the existing problem. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Abstract = {This paper, based on real world event data, introduces a state of the
   art directional element that has been proven to prevent many of the
   commonly reported mis-operations caused by traditional directional
   elements. Such examples include wind farm collector circuits where there
   have been a significant number of documented occurrences of false trips
   due to leading power factor loads caused by dynamic VAR controllers. To
   mitigate, several `work around' solutions have been devised and
   published. These include creative yet cumbersome approaches that use
   load encroachment and reverse power functions, both of which have
   limitations since they were never intended for that purpose. There are
   also challenges using traditional directional elements for situations
   where the fault current is capacitive. Such examples include ground
   fault current in networks that can be operated as either isolated or
   compensated. All of these challenges can be overcome using an `easy to
   set' flexible directional element design that allows for the phase angle
   operating characteristics to be extended or retracted through its
   ninimum/maximum forward and reverse angle settings. For quick and
   efficient evaluation of study cases, specific directional element
   settings have been modeled in protection design software as they appear
   in the relay to ensure the relay will respond securely and reliably for
   all operating conditions (grounding methods), system variables and fault
   scenarios encountered. The paper provides test data and oscillography
   reports from event (COMTRADE) files to validate the directional
   element's performance.},

Year = {1993},
Volume = {92},

Abstract = {The continuous elongation technique is a preparatory step for excision
   of the pathologic palmar fascia for severe Dupuytren's contracture of
   the hands. It consists of a physiologic, painless, and atraumatic
   elongation that is obtained by means of a device fixed on the fourth and
   fifth metacarpal bones by two self-drilling pins.
   This paper presents our experience since 1986 with the TEC device, which
   we designed and bulk for severe hand contracture; the device has been
   applied on 56 hands and 85 fingers seriously flexed by Dupuytren's
   contracture.
   This advanced methodology also represents a real alternative to the
   surgical indication of finger amputation in progressive cases of the
   fascia retraction, and it avoids the necrosis, loss of vascularity, and
   bad functional results frequently seen after classical operations.
   The TEC device also avoids the plastic surgical correction of digital or
   palmar skin loss, particularly when there is a need for a flap or a skin
   graft.
   Dupuytren's contracture was for 160 years thought to be degenerative,
   progressive, and irreversible, but the TEC device, by bringing the
   contracture back to the initial stage of the disease, opens up new basic
   research into morphologic and biochemical processes of the collagen in
   the retracted palmar fascia.},

Title = {Vaccination against misinformation: The inoculation technique reduces
   the continued influence effect},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The continued influence effect of misinformation (CIE) is a phenomenon
   in which certain information, although retracted and corrected, still
   has an impact on event reporting, reasoning, inference, and decisions.
   The main goal of this paper is to investigate to what extent this effect
   can be reduced using the procedure of inoculation and how it can be
   moderated by the reliability of corrections' sources. The results show
   that the reliability of corrections' sources did not affect their
   processing when participants were not inoculated. However, inoculated
   participants relied on misinformation less when the correction came from
   a highly credible source. For this source condition, as a result of
   inoculation, a significant increase in belief in retraction, as well as
   a decrease in belief in misinformation was also found. Contrary to
   previous reports, belief in misinformation rather than belief in
   retraction predicted reliance on misinformation. These findings are of
   both great practical importance as certain boundary conditions for
   inoculation efficiency have been discovered to reduce the impact of the
   continued influence of misinformation, and theoretical, as they provide
   insight into the mechanisms behind CIE. The results were interpreted in
   terms of existing CIE theories as well as within the remembering
   framework, which describes the conversion from memory traces to
   behavioral manifestations of memory.},

Title = {Dynamics of drop impact onto a solid sphere: spreading and retraction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {824},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {In this paper, drop impact onto a sphere is numerically investigated at
   moderate Reynolds and Weber numbers. It is naturally expected that the
   aspect ratio of the sphere to the drop, lambda(r), would make a big
   difference to drop spreading and retraction on the sphere, compared with
   drop impact onto a flat substrate. To quantitatively assess the effect
   of lambda(r), a diffuse-interface immersed-boundary method is adopted
   after being validated against experiments. With the help of numerical
   simulations, we identify the key regimes in the spreading and
   retraction, analyse the results by scaling laws, and quantitatively
   evaluate the effect of lambda(r) on the impact dynamics. We find that
   the thickness of the liquid film spreading on the sphere can be well
   approximated by hL, (infinity)(1 + 3/4 lambda(-3/2)(r)), where
   hL,(infinity) represents the film thickness of drop impact on a flat
   substrate. At the early stage of spreading, the temporal variation of
   the wetted area is independent of lambda(r) when the time is rescaled by
   the thickness of the liquid film. Drops are observed to retract on the
   sphere at a roughly constant speed, and the predictions of theoretical
   analysis are in good agreement with numerical results.},

Abstract = {The intensification of friendship networks among independent singles is
   considered the pleasure offered by the single life' and the sociability,
   rather than domesticity, of this life stage is often emphasised. This
   paper reports on interviews with independent singles from affluent areas
   which suggested that accompanying this cultural norm of sociability was
   the relentless onus of temporal organisation required for interpersonal
   synchronisation with friends. While not retracting their enjoyment of
   the single life, respondents expressed a distinct and distinctive sense
   of risk or vulnerability of spending too much time alone, particularly
   at the weekend. It is argued that, on the one hand, the relative absence
   of paid work at the weekend removes the structures that constrain the
   participation in and the temporal location of joint leisure practices
   during the week. On the other hand, the absence of employment
   structuring people's day increases unpredictability about other people's

Title = {Analyses of the Extensible Blade in Improving Wind Energy Production at
   Sites with Low-Class Wind Resource},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper describes the feasibility analysis of an innovative,
   extensible blade technology. The blade aims to significantly improve the
   energy production of a wind turbine, particularly at locations with
   unfavorable wind conditions. The innovative `smart' blade will be
   extended at low wind speed to harvest more wind energy; on the other
   hand, it will be retracted to its original shape when the wind speed is
   above the rated wind speed to protect the blade from damages by high
   wind loads. An established aerodynamic model is implemented in this
   paper to evaluate and compare the power output of extensible blades
   versus a baseline conventional blade. The model was first validated with
   a monitored power production curve based on the wind energy production
   data of a conventional turbine blade, which is subsequently used to
   estimate the power production curve of extended blades. The
   load-on-blade structures are incorporated as the mechanical criteria to
   design the extension strategies. Wind speed monitoring data at three
   different onshore and offshore sites around Lake Erie are used to
   predict the annual wind energy output with different blades. The effects
   of extension on the dynamic characteristics of blade are analyzed. The
   results show that the extensive blade significantly increases the annual
   wind energy production (up to 20\% to 30\%) with different blade
   extension strategies. It, therefore, has the potential to significantly
   boost wind energy production for utility-scale wind turbines located at
   sites with low-class wind resource.},

Title = {Impact of location and flow rate oscillation of the pilot jet on the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {The paper investigates the swirling flow structures in an unconfined
   coannular swirl burner under different conditions, namely, with or
   without heat release, two locations of the pilot jet, and constant or
   pulsating mass flow rate in the pilot jet. Six turbulent premixed
   swirling flames as well as two isothermal turbulent swirling flow cases
   for reference are studied with the aid of large-eddy simulation.
   Detailed comparisons with experimental data are performed for velocity
   statistics, and generally good agreement is achieved. Furthermore,
   coherent structures are analyzed, and local power spectra are computed.
   In the nonreactive case with retracted pilot jet, a very strong
   precessing vortex core (PVC) is observed in both the numerical result
   and the experiment. The PVC is weak in the nonretracted case. In the
   reactive cases in which the whole central recirculation zone is enclosed
   in the high-temperature postflame region, the PVC is almost completely
   suppressed. In pulsating reactive jets, the vortex structures exhibit a
   ring shape but not the spiral shape shown in the reactive cases with
   constant mass flow rate in the pilot jet. The flame response to a
   sinusoidal variation of the mass flow rate in the pilot jet is studied,
   and an attempt to quantitatively compare the flame transfer function is
   performed as well.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the treatment of a female patient, aged 23 years
   and 5 months, with a Class 11 division 1 malocclusion, who showed severe
   anterior protrusion and lower anterior crowding. Specially-designed
   orthodontic mini-implants were placed bilaterally in the interdental
   space between both the upper and the lower posterior teeth. Both lower
   first molars showed severe apical lesions. Therefore, the treatment plan
   consisted of extraction of both upper first premolars and lower first
   molars, en masse retraction of the upper six anterior teeth, lower
   anterior alignment, and protraction of all the lower molars.
   C-implants((R)) were used as substitutes for maxillary posterior
   anchorage teeth during anterior retraction and as hooks for mandibular
   molar protraction. The correct overbite and overjet were obtained by
   intruding and retracting the upper six anterior teeth into their proper
   positions. The dentition was detailed using conventional orthodontic
   appliances. The upper C-implants contributed to an improvement in facial
   balance, and the lower C-implants made it possible to protract the lower
   second and third molars with less effect on the axis of the lower
   anterior teeth. The active treatment period was 29 months and the
   patient's teeth continued to be stable 11 months after debonding.},

Title = {CONDITIONAL OBJECTS AS NONMONOTONIC CONSEQUENCE RELATIONSHIPS},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper is an investigation of the relationship be tween conditional
   objects obtained as a qualitative counterpart to conditional
   probabilities, and nonmonotonic reasoning. Roughly speaking, a
   conditional object can be seen as a generic rule which allows us to get
   a conclusion provided that the available information exactly corresponds
   to the `'context'' part of the conditional object. This gives freedom
   for possibly retracting previous conclusions when the available
   information becomes more specific. Viewed as an inference rule
   expressing a contextual belief, the conditional object is shown to
   possess all properties of a well-behaved nonmonotonic consequence
   relation when a suitable choice of connectives and deduction operation
   is made. Using previous results from Adams' conditional probabilistic
   logic, a logic of conditional objects is proposed. Its axioms and
   inference rules are those of preferential reasoning logic of Lehmann and
   colleagues. But the semantics relies on a three-valued truth valuation
   first suggested by De Finetti. It is more elementary and intuitive than
   the preferential semantics of Lehmann and colleagues and does not
   require probabilistic semantics. The analysis of a notion of consistency
   of a set of conditional objects is studied in the light of such a
   three-valued semantics and higher level counterparts of deduction
   theorem, modus ponens, resolution and refutation are suggested.
   Limitations of this logic are discussed. The rest of the paper is
   devoted to studying what remains of the logic in the setting of
   numerical probability theory.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {350},
Number = {1},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents experimental and numerical investigations of single
   drop impacts onto liquid films of finite thickness. The dynamics of the
   drop impingement on liquid surface films, the shape of the cavity, the
   surface film dynamics and the residual film thickness are investigated
   and analysed. The shape of the penetrating cavity within the surface
   film is observed experimentally using a high-speed video system.
   Additionally, the thickness of the liquid film between the expanding,
   receding and retracting cavity and the solid wall is monitored in time
   using an optical sensor based on chromatic confocal imaging. The effects
   of various influencing parameters, such as the drop impingement
   velocity, liquid properties (surface tension and viscosity) and the
   initial liquid film thickness, on the time evolution of the cavity and
   film dynamics are investigated. Complementary to the experiments direct
   numerical simulations of the drop impacts and cavity expansion are
   performed using a volume-of-fluid free-surface capturing model in the
   framework of the finite volume numerical method. The numerical
   predictions of the film thickness dynamics agree well with the
   experiments for most phases of the impingement process. Finally, a
   scaling analysis of the residual film thickness between the cavity and
   the solid wall is performed for various impingement parameters. (C) 2010

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Throughout the years, Sosa has taken different views on the safety
   condition on knowledge. In his early work, he endorsed the safety
   condition, but later retracted this view when first developing his much
   discussed virtue epistemology. Recently, Sosa has further developed his
   virtue theory with the notion of competence and has developed an
   accompanying, modified safety condition that he maintains is entailed by
   that theory: the SSS-safety condition. Sosa's view is that this
   condition holds on both knowledge and action, because both knowledge and
   action are the manifestations of competence. The SSS-safety condition,
   roughly, says that if S were to make an attempt at phi-ing under certain
   specified shape-situation pairs, holding fixed their seat, then S would
   phi. The argument of this paper is that this new SSS-safety condition
   does not hold on either knowledge or action. We argue for this
   conclusion by providing a principled way to generate counterexamples to
   the condition for both knowledge and action. The reasoning is that there
   can exist a non-empty symmetric difference between the sets of
   shape-situation pairs under which distinct agents can manifest their
   epistemic and pragmatic competences, and if there can exist such a
   symmetric difference then the SSS-safety condition fails to hold.},

Abstract = {A wicked problem is a complex one with innumerable causes, is difficult
   to describe, and does not have a right answer. Addressing vaccine
   hesitancy is a wicked problem that has existed since smallpox
   inoculation began in 1796. Spurred by a now-discredited and retracted
   paper by Wakefield, et al. in 1998 and facilitated by the ease of
   connectivity through social media, distrust in vaccination is highly
   publicized, currently contributing to the largest measles outbreak in
   the United States since 1994, threatening public health as more
   vaccine-preventable diseases may be on the rise. Research to address
   vaccine hesitancy has been focused on building vaccine confidence,
   understanding the effects of diseases themselves, who is trusted to make
   a recommendation (i.e. health-care professionals), the need for a strong

Abstract = {Feasibility studies are needed to demonstrate that safe and effective
   manipulation of bowel during Minimal Access Surgery (MAS) can be
   obtained by use of magnetic force. This paper characterises two classes
   of magnetic particles: stainless steel microparticles (SS-mu Ps) and
   iron oxide nanoparticles (IO-nPs) in terms of their magnetisation,
   chemical composition, crystallinity, morphology and size distribution.
   Both magnetic particles were dispersed in a high viscosity biological
   liquid for intraluminal injection of bowel. Ex vivo porcine bowel
   segments were then retracted by permanent magnetic probes of 5.0 and 10
   mm diameter. Strong retraction forces reaching 6 N maximum were obtained
   by magnetic fluid based on dispersion of SS-mu Ps. In contrast, the
   IO-nP-based magnetic liquid generated less attraction force, due to both
   lower magnetic and solution properties of the IO-nPs. The comparison of
   the two particles allowed the identification of the rules to engineer
   the next generation of particles. The results with SS-mu Ps provide
   proof on concept that intraluminal injection of magnetic fluid can
   generate sufficient force for efficient bowel retraction. Thereafter we
   shall carry out in vivo animal studies for efficacy and safety of both
   types of ferrofluids. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   The following issues are noted:
   Table1 contains clinical data described in the paper as being derived
   from a cohort of asthma patients. However, the provenance of this data
   is unclear. Based on the evidence available, the University of Dundee
   investigation concluded that the majority of the patient cohort is
   likely to be a subset of a cohort of cystic fibrosis patients reported
   in PLoS One 8(12): e82432 (), although in a number of cases the
   patient's gender is at odds between the two reports. The RNAseq data are
   unavailable on the European Nucleotide Archive under the reported
   accession number ERG003569. RNAseq data were uploaded with accession
   number ERS654066 before publication. The paper describes use of both
   prednisolone and prednisone, yet only the latter was used in the study.},

Title = {The retraction algorithm for factoring banded symmetric matrices},
Journal = {NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {237-254},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Let A be an n x n symmetric matrix of bandwidth 2m + 1. The matrix need
   not be positive definite. In this paper we will present an algorithm for
   factoring A which preserves symmetry and the band structure and limits
   element growth in the factorization. With this factorization one may
   solve a linear system with A as the coefficient matrix and determine the
   inertia of A, the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of
   A. The algorithm requires between 1/2nm(2) and 5/4nm(2) multiplications
   and at most (2m + I)n locations compared to non-symmetric Gaussian
   elimination which requires between nm(2) and 2nm(2) multiplications and
   at most (3m + 1)n locations. Our algorithm reduces A to block diagonal
   form with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 blocks on the diagonal. When pivoting for
   stability and subsequent transformations produce non-zero elements
   outside the original band, column/row transformations are used to
   retract the bandwidth. To decrease the operation count and the necessary
   storage, we use the fact that the correction outside the band is rank-1
   and invert the process, applying the transformations that would restore
   the bandwidth first, followed by a modified correction. This paper
   contains an element growth analysis and a computational comparison with
   LAPACKs non-symmetric band routines and the Snap-back code of Irony and
   Toledo. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Ethical failings: The problematic history of cancer risk assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper demonstrates that unethical conduct by the US National
   Academy of Sciences (NAS) Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation (BEAR)
   I Genetics Panel led to their recommendation of the Linear Non-Threshold
   (LNT) Model for radiation risk assessment and its subsequent adoption by
   the US and the world community. The analysis, which is based largely on
   preserved communications of the US NAS Genetics Panel members, reveals
   that Panel members and their administrative leadership at the NAS
   displayed an integrated series of unethical actions designed to ensure,
   (1) the acceptance of the LNT and (2) funding to radiation geneticist
   panel members and professional colleagues. These findings are
   significant because major public policies in open democracies, such as
   cancer risk assessment and other issues impacted by public fears of
   radiation or chemical exposures, require ethical foundations.
   Recognition of these ethical failures of the BEAR I Genetics Panel
   should require a high level administrative, legislative and scientific
   reassessment of the scientific foundations of cancer risk assessment,
   with the likely result necessitating revision of current policies and
   practices. The BEAR I Genetics Panel, 1956 Science journal publication
   should immediately be retracted because it contains deliberate
   misrepresentations of the scientific record that were designed to
   manipulate scientific and public opinion on radiation risk assessment in
   a dishonest manner.},

Journal = {AIAA JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2135-2145},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A new concept of active dynamic stall control is proposed, designed and
   experimentally tested on a OA209 airfoil model. The active control
   principle is based on leading-edge vortex generation in order to
   alleviate the dynamic stall vortex formed and convected at the
   leading-edge of an airfoil operating at a helicopter blade in fast
   forward flight. The active device aims to be used only during retreating
   blade side for dynamic stall flight conditions in order to avoid drag
   penalties on the advancing blade side. The designed actuator is a row of
   deployable vortex generators (DVGs) located at the leading-edge of the
   airfoil that fit the airfoil shape when retracted. Deployment is
   possible for different heights as well as different phases and
   frequencies with respect to the airfoil oscillation. The paper addresses
   the validation of the effectiveness of the devices to delay static stall
   and alleviate dynamic stall penalties. Results show a delay in static
   stall angle of attack of 3 deg and a reduction of negative pitching
   moment peak up to 60\% for dynamic stall. The analysis of the
   experimental database indicates that different compromises between lift
   and pitching-moment can be achieved depending on the phase actuation of
   the DVGs.},

Abstract = {In this project, we further developed and tested a ``ZipperMast{''} for
   small robots and legacy manned vehicles. The ZipperMast knits three
   coiled bands of spring steel together to form a rigid mast. As the mast
   is extended, it draws up a cable connecting the host platform to the
   payload, typically antennas and sensors. Elevating the payload improves
   line of sight, and thus improves radio communication and surveillance
   situation awareness. When the mast is retracted, the interior cable
   slides into a horizontal tray. The ZipperMast is a scaleable design. We
   have made systems that elevate to 8 and 20 feet. The 8 foot ZipperMast
   collapses to less that 8 inches high and 8 inches wide. The 20 foot
   ZipperMast collapses to less that 12 inches high and 18 inches wide. In
   this paper we report on tests of the mechanical properties of the mast,
   specifically the strength and stiffness under quasi-static and impulsive
   loading. These properties are important for specifying constraints on
   height as a function of speed and payload and on speed as a function of
   height and payload in order to ensure that the mast will not fail in the
   event of sudden stop, as in the event of a collision.},

Abstract = {Comparing 5 publications from China that described knockdowns of the
   human TPD52L2 gene in human cancer cell lines identified unexpected
   similarities between these publications, flaws in experimental design,
   and mis-matches between some described experiments and the reported
   results. Following communications with journal editors, two of these
   TPD52L2 publications have been retracted. One retraction notice stated
   that while the authors claimed that the data were original, the
   experiments had been out-sourced to a biotechnology company. Using
   search engine queries, automatic text-analysis, different similarity
   measures, and further visual inspection, we identified 48 examples of
   highly similar papers describing single gene knockdowns in 1-2 human
   cancer cell lines that were all published by investigators from China.
   The incorrect use of a particular TPD52L2 shRNA sequence as a negative
   or non-targeting control was identified in 30/48 (63\%) of these

Abstract = {Transhydrogenase couples the reduction of NADP(+) by NADH to inward
   proton translocation across the bacterial (or mitochondrial) membrane.
   Conformational changes in the NADP(H)-binding component of the enzyme
   (dIII) are central to the coupling mechanism. In the ``open{''} state,
   NADP(H) bound to dIII can readily exchange with nucleotides in the
   solvent but hydride transfer {[}to/from NAD(H) bound to dI] is
   prevented. In the ``occluded{''} state, bound NADP(H) cannot exchange
   with solvent nucleotides but the hydride transfer reaction is permitted.
   It was previously found that the conformational state of isolated,
   recombinant dIII is pH dependent. At neutral pH, the protein adopts a
   conformation resembling the occluded state, and at low pH, it adopts a
   conformation resembling the open state. The crystal structure of dIII
   indicates that the loop E ``lid{''} might be largely responsible for the
   very high affinity of the protein for NADP(H). In this paper we show,
   using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that the distance between
   the apex of loop E of isolated dIII, and the core of the protein,
   increases when the solution pH is lowered. This is consistent with the
   view that the lid is retracted to permit NADPH release during turnover
   of the complete enzyme. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Luffing mechanism is a key component of the construction machinery. This
   paper proposes a two degree of freedom (2-DOF) luffing mechanism, which
   has one more pair of driving cylinders than the single DOF luffing
   mechanism, to improve the performance of the machinery. To establish the
   dynamic model of the 2-DOF luffing mechanism, firstly, we develop a
   hierarchical method to deduce the Jacobian matrix and Hessian matrix for
   obtaining the kinematics equations. Subsequently, we divide the luffing
   mechanism into six bodies considering actuators, and deduce the kinetic
   equations of each body by the Newton-Euler method. Based on the dynamic
   model, we simulate the luffing process. Finally, a prototype is built on
   a pile driver to validate the model. Simulations and experiments show
   that the dynamic model can reflect the dynamic properties of the
   proposed luffing mechanism. And the control strategy that the front
   cylinders retract first shows better mechanical behavior than the other
   two control strategies. This research provides a reference for the
   design and application of 2-DOF luffing mechanism on construction
   machinery. The modeling approach can also be applied to similar
   mechanism with serial closed kinematic chains, which allows to calculate
   the dynamic parameters easily and exactly.},

Volume = {85},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In the early phases of an immune response, T cells of appropriate
   antigen specificity become activated by antigen-presenting cells in
   secondary lymphoid organs. Two-photon microscopy imaging experiments
   have shown that this stimulation occurs in distinct stages during which
   T cells exhibit different motilities and interactions with dendritic
   cells (DCs). In this paper, we utilize the Cellular Potts Model, a model
   formalism that takes cell shapes and cellular interactions explicitly
   into account, to simulate the dynamics of, and interactions between, T
   cells and DCs in the lymph node paracortex. Our three-dimensional
   simulations suggest that the initial decrease in T-cell motility after
   antigen appearance is due to `stop signals' transmitted by activated DCs
   to T cells. The long-lived interactions that occur at a later stage can
   only be explained by the presence of both stop signals and a high
   adhesion between specific T cells and antigen-bearing DCs. Furthermore,
   our results indicate that long-lasting contacts with T cells are
   promoted when DCs retract dendrites that detect a specific contact at
   lower velocities than other dendrites. Finally, by performing long
   simulations (after prior fitting to short time scale data) we are able
   to provide an estimate of the average contact duration between T cells
   and DCs.},

Title = {Fruit of Staphylea (Staphyleaceae) from the Oligocene of Montana, USA},
Journal = {REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {280},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Staphylea has abundant isolated seeds in the fossil record, but no
   fossil fruits of this genus have been confirmed before. In this paper,
   we report a capsular fruit of Staphylea from the Oligocene Renova
   Formation of Woodworth, western-central Montana, USA. Detailed
   investigation of this fruit gives new insights on the phylogenetic and
   biogeographic history of the genus. Morphological comparison with modern
   Staphylea fruits shows its closest resemblance to the extant Asian
   spedes, S. bumalda DC., which is similar in fruit shape, size, and
   pericarp venation, but differs by the angle of interlobal sinus and the
   stipe development. We establish a new fossil species, S. woodworthensis
   Zhu \& Manchester sp. nov. for this fossil fruit. This discovery
   indicates that Staphylea was already established in western North
   America at least by the Oligocene, which is inconsistent with the recent
   interpretation of a late Oligocene origin of the genus in Europe. The
   distribution of fossils indicates an earlier diversification of
   Staphylea, along with other staphyleaceous genera, back to early
   Paleogene in North America. The genus subsequently retracted its range
   to the east and south in North America as evidenced by younger fossils
   and its modern geographic range. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Well they had a couple of bats to be truthful: Well-prefaced,

Abstract = {This paper reports a conversation analytic study of well-prefaced,
   self-initiated repairs in talk-in-interaction. We show that speakers use
   well-prefacing of self-repairs to manage the credibility of claims in
   talk. Specifically, well-prefaced self-repairs attend to the relevant
   accuracy of a turn-so-far by revising it but without retracting it. For
   example, in the extract from which the title for this paper is taken, a
   speaker tells an interviewer that in New Zealand the- they for millions
   of years had no mammals. The- they they only had really birds'. This
   turns out to be a slightly exaggerated claim, which the speaker
   self-repairs in the transition space with a well-prefaced statement -
   `Well they had .hhh a couple of batsto be (.).hhh to be truthful But (.)
   they had no big mammals. No cats. No (.) dogs. No stoats'. Here, the
   additional information modifies the claim that there were no mammals
   (because there were bats) but also maintains the gist of what was said
   earlier (i.e. there were no large, predatory mammals). Our work has
   clear resonances with Drew's (2003) analysis of precision and
   exaggeration in interaction, though where he focussed on
   recipient-prompted revisions, we focus on self-initiation. Like Drew, we
   note that participants' orientations to speaking precisely connect to
   matters of veracity and accountability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Medium Voltage (MV), High Current (HC) switches are growing in demand
   for MV applications in land, sea and air transport, fast charging,
   renewable energy, and a host of applications in pulsed power, e.g.
   solid-state protection. However, widespread adoption of commercially
   available MV-HC modules is limited due to retracted dynamic performance
   from paralleling many high voltage, low current semiconductors. The
   associated cost is relatively high because of low yield, and expensive
   material and fabrication. An alternative is series connection of Low
   Voltage (LV)-HC semiconductors to form a SuperCascode (SC) power switch.
   This paper introduces a Cascaded SuperCascode (CSC) power switch
   topology that scales to very high voltages (>100 kV) or applied to
   optimize previously reported MV SCs to achieve higher switching speed,
   reduced balancing network size and lower switching losses. This paper
   describes the design of the balancing network for optimized CSC switch
   switching speed, and provides simulation and test results of a 6.5 kV
   power switch. The switch simulated to show a 4.5x improvement in
   switching speed (avg of T-on and T-off), 40\% reduction in switching
   losses, 60\% net charge reduction in network capacitors (i.e. size
   reduction) and superior avalanche energy management for greater short
   circuit performance compared to other SCs. The switch was fabricated and
   tested showing 408 m Omega, 0.7 mA @ 4.8 kV and 23ns rise and 50ns fall
   in current at 4kV for 50A switching from double-pulse testing (DPT).},

Abstract = {Koro is a syndrome in which the penis (or sometimes the nipples or
   vulva) is retracting, with deleterious effects for the sufferer. In
   modern psychiatry, it is considered a culture-bound syndrome (CBS). This
   paper considers the formation and development of psychiatric conceptions
   of koro and related genital retraction syndromes from the 1890s to the
   present. It does so by examining the different explanations of koro
   based on shifting conceptions of mental illness, and considers the
   increased recognition of the role culture has to play in psychiatric
   concepts. Conceptions of culture (deriving from colonial psychiatry as
   well as from anthropology) actively shaped the ways in which
   psychiatrists conceptualized koro. Cases under consideration, additional
   to the first Dutch descriptions of koro, include the ways in which koro
   was identified in white western cases, and the 1967 Singaporean koro
   epidemic. Following a number of psychiatrists and psychologists who have
   addressed the same material, attention is also paid to the recent
   genital-theft panics in sub-Saharan Africa, considering the implications
   of the differences between koro and other genital-theft panics. Finally,
   the paper addresses the role played by koro in the development of the
   concept of CBSs, which was first presented in the DSM IV in 1994. This
   is explored against the backdrop of emerging ideas about culture and
   psychiatry from the late colonial period, especially in Africa, which
   are central to modern ideas about transcultural psychiatry.},

Abstract = {It has been a pleasure and a privilege to serve as the first
   Editor-in-Chief of Royal Society Open Science for the past 6 years. I
   step down at the end of December 2021, having completed two 3-year
   terms, and am taking the opportunity here to reflect on some of the
   successes and challenges that the journal has experienced and the
   innovations that we have introduced. When I was first approached back in
   2015, the breadth of the journal, covering the whole of science,
   resonated with my own interests: my research career has ranged across
   the entire landscape of chemistry, while my leadership roles have
   embraced all of science, technology and medicine. The open access ethos,
   the objective refereeing policy that rejects the idea of only publishing
   what is in fashion, and the opportunities offered by a new venture that
   could transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries also all appealed to
   me. Among our successful innovations are Registered Reports, Replication
   Studies and the new `Science, Society and Policy' section. The
   challenges have included the transition to paid article processing
   charges (APCs), whether to resist pressure to retract a controversial
   paper, and bullying of young female authors by established senior males
   in the same field. I explore all of these below, provide some statistics
   on the journal's performance, also cover some of the notable papers we
   have published, and provide some concluding thoughts.},

Title = {The Seralini affair: degeneration of Science to Re-Science?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {A paper reporting findings relevant to safety of the genetically
   modified (GM) maize NK603 and the herbicide Roundup (Seralini et al.,
   Food Chem Toxicol. 50:4221-4231, 2012) was retracted against the wishes
   of the authors, and subsequently republished in another peer-reviewed
   journal (Seralini et al. Environ Sci Europe, doi:
   10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5, 2014). These events exemplify a trend in
   which disputes, between interest groups vying for retraction and
   republication of papers that report controversial results, overshadow
   the normal scientific process in which peer-reviewed publication
   stimulates new research, generating new empirical evidence that drives
   the evolution of scientific understanding. This paper reviews the
   current status of research on safety of NK603 maize and Roundup
   herbicide for human and livestock health, and attempts to glean from
   recent developments insights relevant to risk assessment policy for GM
   crops and pesticides, as well as relevant to the scientific process in
   general. Our analysis of currently published evidence confirms NK603 and
   Roundup are kidney and liver toxicants at levels below current
   regulatory thresholds. Consequently, the regulatory status of NK603,
   glyphosate and Roundup requires reevaluation. Additionally, preliminary
   evidence indicates Roundup and NK603, individually and in combination,
   may increase tumor incidence and mortality. Follow-up long-term
   carcinogenicity studies, using test animal strains and numbers of
   animals that assure robust conclusions, are required to confirm/refute
   this preliminary evidence. The inherent tension between the scientific
   process and commercial interests of product developers necessitates
   implementation of safeguards that protect the scientific process and
   prevent degeneration of Science to Re-Science (typified by retraction
   and republication disputes).},

Title = {A closed-loop constant deposition current control method based on MCED
   circuit model},
Journal = {AIP ADVANCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED) is a simple and economical
   fabrication method for micro/nanoscale three-dimensional metal printing.
   In most applications of MCED of copper pillars using a deposition
   pipette probe, there exists a certain probe retraction speed range that
   can ensure successful pillar deposition. If the probe retraction speed
   exceeds this range, however, the morphological changes in the contact
   meniscus droplet bridge between the probe tip and substrate induce
   deposition current fluctuations. These fluctuations result in uneven
   pillar diameters (i.e., beaded wire deposition) and can even lead to
   nanowire breakage and growth termination. To analyze the MCED process,
   therefore, this paper first proposes a circuit model for the MCED
   process and then, based on this model, analyzes the mechanism underlying
   the deposition current fluctuations present as the probe retracts at
   higher speeds. To effectively suppress these deposition current
   fluctuations and improve the stability and quality of deposited copper
   pillars, a closed-loop constant-deposition-current control method is
   proposed. Compared with deposition using no control strategy, the
   constant-deposition-current control method is shown by simulations and
   experiments to significantly suppress the fluctuation of the deposition
   current and increase the stability of copper pillar growth. In addition,
   the constant-deposition-current control method is used for the rapid
   fabrication of copper pillars with high aspect ratios.},

Title = {MD-MARS: Maintainability Framework Based on Data Flow Prediction Using
   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines Algorithm in Wireless Sensor
   Network},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {10604-10622},
Abstract = {The demand for Wireless Sensor Networks is increasing day by day because
   of their diverse nature. Due to the limited energy, it is a complex task
   to retract the sensor node after deployment. So, there is a requirement
   for network maintainability before the deployment phase for its smooth
   working. It is achieved in three phases: hardware of the sensor node,
   communication and external environmental phase. This paper focuses on
   network maintainability in the communication phase. A novel framework
   MD-MARS is presented to enhance the network maintainability. This
   framework is classified into three phases namely analysis of performance
   parameters, data flow optimization and maintainability evaluation. In
   the initial phase, the performance parameter is analyzed using NS2
   simulator. The next phase deals with data flow optimization using a
   machine learning algorithm. It reduces congestion and enhances network
   performance. The proposed algorithm is finely tuned to different degrees
   using the Grid Search approach to achieve the highest accuracy. The best
   model is selected based on accuracy and minimizes the prediction error.
   This algorithm predicts with the highest accuracy of 99.83\%, lowest
   being 21.17\%. Maintainability is achieved in the last phase using the
   total time taken to optimize the data flow. Several observations of
   repair time are determined for the best-tune model during the prediction
   of optimized data flow. These observations are used to calculate the
   mean time to repair, standard deviation, probability density function,
   maintainability and repair rate. The maximum maintainability achieved in
   this paper is 97.67\% at a repair time of 26.07 milliseconds.},

Abstract = {Recent developments have enabled daily accumulated medical information
   to be converted into medical big data, and new evidence is expected to
   be created using databases and various open data sources. Database
   research using medical big data was actively conducted in the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and created evidence for a
   new disease. Conversely, the new term ``infodemic{''} has emerged and
   has become a social problem. Multiple posts on social networking
   services (SNS) overly stirred up safety concerns about the COVID-19
   vaccines based on the analysis results of the Vaccine Adverse Event
   Reporting System (VAERS). Medical experts on SNS have attempted to
   correct these misunderstandings. Incidents where research papers about
   the COVID-19 treatment using medical big data were retracted due to the
   lack of reliability of the database also occurred. These topics of
   appropriate interpretation of results using spontaneous reporting
   databases and ensuring the reliability of databases are not new issues
   that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic but issues that were present
   before. Thus, literacy regarding medical big data has become
   increasingly important. Research related to artificial intelligence (AI)
   is also progressing rapidly. Using medical big data is expected to
   accelerate AI development. However, as medical AI does not resolve all
   clinical setting problems, we also need to improve our medical AI
   literacy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, it is aimed to investigate the ambivalently psychological
   construction of the protagonist Jose Celio in the novel De mim ja nem se
   lembra, by Luiz Ruffato. Jose Celio's perception, regarding his
   migration to Greater Sao Paulo and his relation there, is inscribed on
   an instinct duality sense, denying, therefore, a manichean point of view
   of the world. In his letters sent to his mother, which are the core of
   the narrative, the protagonist's affective ambiguities, and the
   conflicted association of what is around him, are manifested: for
   example, at the same time that he misses his family, he edifies other
   bonds; at the same time that his work retracts his hours of joy, the
   labor itself provides him his political education in the middle of a
   dictatorship. The feeling of helplessness, the loss of a stable place,
   provokes, as well, through Jose Celio's partial porosity, his individual
   autonomy. Based on the ideas of Sigmund Freud (1986) about the feeling
   of helplessness, of Enrico Testa (2019) on the permeability of the
   literary characters, of Franco Moretti regarding the Bildungsroman and
   the texts of the novels critical fortune, it is shown how the nostalgia
   and the potent will of building the future, which is ambiguously
   ruptured by his early death, coexist in the registration of the
   protagonist's psychology through the letters to his mother.},

Abstract = {Assume that C is a closed convex subset of a reflexive Banach space E
   and phi = \{T(i)\}(i is an element of I) is a family of self-mappings on
   C of type (gamma) such that F(phi), the common fixed point set of phi,
   is nonempty. From our results in this paper, it can be derived that: (a)
   If boolean OR(i is an element of I), F(T(i)) is contained in a
   3-dimensional subspace of E then F(phi) is a nonexpansive retract of C;
   (b) If phi is commutative, there exists a retraction R of type (gamma)
   from C onto F(phi), such that RT(i) = T(i)R = R(for all i), and every
   closed convex phi-invariant subset of C is R-invariant; the same result
   holds for a non-commutative right amenable semigroup phi, under some
   additional assumptions. Moreover, the existence of a (T(i))-ergodic
   retraction R of type (gamma) from (C) over tilde = \{(X(i)) is an
   element of l(infinity) (E) : x(i) is an element of C, for all i is an
   element of l\} onto F(phi) in l(infinity) (E) for the family phi is
   discussed. We also apply some of our results to find ergodic retractions
   for nonexpansive affine mappings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   topological spaces. In relation to the development of a homotopy for the
   category of Marcus-Wyse (for short M-) topological spaces on Z(2), we
   need to generalize the M-topology on Z(2) to higher dimensional spaces X
   subset of Z(n), n >= 3 {[}18]. Hence the present paper establishes a new
   topology on Z(n), n is an element of N, where Ni s the set of natural
   numbers. It is called the generalized Marcus-Wyse (for short H-)
   topology and is denoted by (Z(n), gamma(n)). Besides, we prove that
   (Z(3), gamma(3)) induces only 6- or 18-adjacency relations. Namely,
   (Z(3), gamma(3)) does not support a 26-adjacency, which is quite
   different from the Khalimsky topology for 3D digital spaces. After
   developing an H-adjacency induced by the connectedness of
   (Z(n),gamma(n)), the present paper establishes topological graphs based
   on the H-topology, which is called an HA-space, so that we can establish
   a category of HA-spaces. By using the H-adjacency, we propose an
   H-topological graph homomorphism (for short HA-map) and an
   HA-isomorphism. Besides, we prove that an HA-map (resp. an
   HA-isomorphism) is broader than an H-continuous map (resp. an
   H-homeomorphism) and is an H-connectedness preserving map. Finally,
   after investigating some properties of an HA-isomorphism, we propose
   both an HA-retract and an extension problem of an HA-map for studying
   HA-spaces.},

Abstract = {Robotic surgical assistants are enhancing physician performance,
   enabling physicians to perform more delicate and precise minimally
   invasive surgery. However, these devices are currently tele-operated and
   lack autonomy. In this paper, we present initial steps toward automating
   a commonly performed surgical task, tissue retraction, which involves
   grasping and lifting a thin layer of tissue to expose an underlying
   area. Given a model of tissues in the vicinity, our method computes a
   motion plan for a 6-DOF gripper that grasps a tissue flap at an optimal
   location and retracts it such that an underlying target is fully
   visible. The planner considers three optimization objectives relevant to
   medical applications: minimizing the maximum deformation energy,
   minimizing maximum stress, and minimizing the control effort in lifting
   the tissue flap. The planner can be used to locally improve physician
   specified retraction trajectories based on the optimization criteria or
   to compute a de novo plan. We use a physically-based simulation to
   compute equilibrium configurations of the tissue flap subject to
   manipulation constraints. These configurations are used with a
   sampling-based planner to explore the space of deformations and compute
   an optimal plan subject to discretization and modeling error. Our
   experimental results illustrate the ability of the method to compute
   retractions for heterogeneous tissues while avoiding obstacles and
   minimizing tissue damage.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of multimedia and internet allows for wide
   distribution of digital media data. It becomes much easier to edit,
   modify and duplicate digital information. In additional, digital
   document is also easy to copy and distribute, therefore it may face many
   threats. It became necessary to find an appropriate protection due to
   the significance, accuracy and sensitivity of the information. Nowadays,
   protection system can be classified into more specific as hiding
   information and encryption information or a combination between them.
   The strength of the combination between hiding and encryption science is
   due to the non-existence of standard algorithms to be used in (hiding
   and encryption) secret messages. Also there is randomness in hiding
   methods such as combining several media (covers) with different methods
   to pass a secret message. Furthermore, there is no formal method to be
   followed to discover a hidden data In this paper, a new information
   hiding system is presented. The aim of the proposed system is to hide
   information (data file) in an execution file (EXE). The new proposed
   system is able to embed an information in an execution file and also
   able to retract the hidden file from the execution file. Meanwhile,
   since the cover file might be used to identify hiding information, the
   proposed system considers overcoming this dilemma by using the execution
   file as a cover file.},

Abstract = {Automation feeding machine helps to replace the manual feeding of the
   components to achieve the production rate. Even so, all industrialists
   have been trying to get 100\% efficiency from every machine and to give
   more production. The production rate of the machine is depended on
   certain factors like feeding, accuracy, Manpower, etc. However, feeding
   is the most important factor, because the production will be fast only
   while the component is federal quick. This paper is providing an
   automation solution of feed ball joints for an automotive industry when
   the vehicle gathers the steering assembly. There were many feeding
   mechanisms available. Still, the ball joint is such a large component
   and should need a certain interval to feed it correctly as required. In
   this machine, the hoppers to be a trapezoidal tanks stores the sorted of
   long components. The two-step feeders consist of cylinders, which make
   the movement of steps. The steps that are used the EN-8 materials are
   used to make the feeder assembly, and those are connected with the
   cylinders that are used to construct the up and down movements, when the
   cylinder makes the forward and retracts motion. The steps scoop up the
   components and feed them to the additive chute. The linear chute
   transfers the properly oriented components to the singling unit feeds
   the components to the machine for making further operations.},

Abstract = {For a class M of monomorphisms of a category, mathematicians usually use
   different types of essentiality. Essentiality is an important notion
   closely related to injectivity. Banaschewski defines and gives
   sufficient conditions on a category A and a subclass M of its
   monomorphisms under which M-injectivity well-behaves with respect to the
   notions such as M-absolute retract and M-essentialness.
   In this paper, A is taken to be the category of acts over a semigroup S
   and M-sd to be the class of strongly s-dense monomorphisms. We study
   essentiality with respect to strongly s-dense monomorphisms of acts.
   Depending on a class M of morphisms of a category A, In some
   literatures, three different types of essentialness are considered. Each
   has its own benefits in regards with the behavior of M-injectivity. We
   will show that these three different definitions of essentiality with
   respect to the class of strongly s-dense monomorphisms are equivalent.
   Also, the existence and the explicit description of a strongly s-dense
   injective hull for any given act which is equivalent to the maximal such
   essential extension and minimal strongly s-dense injective extension
   with respect to strongly s-dense monomorphism is investigated. At last
   we conclude that strongly s-dense injectivity well behaves in the
   category Act-S. (C) 2020 Mathematical Institute Slovak Academy of

Abstract = {In this paper, we perform a parametric study of the nonlinear dynamics
   of a reduced order model for boiling water reactors (BWR) near the Hopf
   bifurcation point using the method of multiple scales (MMS). Analysis
   has been performed for general values of the parameters, but the results
   are demonstrated for parameter values of the model corresponding to the
   advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR). The neutronics of the AHWR is
   modeled using point reactor kinetic equations while a one-node lumped
   parameter model is assumed both for the fuel and the coolant for
   modeling the thermal-hydraulics. Nonlinearities in the heat transfer
   process are ignored and attention is focused on the nonlinearity
   introduced by the reactivity feedback. It is found that the steady-state
   operation of the AHWR mathematical model looses stability via. a Hopf
   bifurcation resulting in power oscillations as some typical bifurcation
   parameter like the void coefficient of reactivity is varied. The
   bifurcation is found to be subcritical for the parameter values
   corresponding to the AHWR. However, with a decrease in the fuel
   temperature coefficient of reactivity the bifurcation turns to
   supercritical implying global stability of the steady state operation in
   the linear stability regime. Moreover slight intrusion into the
   instability regime results in small-amplitude limit cycles leaving the
   possibility of retracting back to stable operation. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {We prove existence of extension dimension for paracompact spaces. Here
   is the main result of the paper:
   Theorem. Suppose X is a paracompact space. There is a CW complex K such
   that
   (a) K is an absolute extensor of X up to homotopy,
   (b) If a CW complex L is an absolute extensor of X up to homotopy, then
   L is an absolute extensor of Y up to homotopy of any paracompact space Y
   such that K is an absolute extensor of Y up to homotopy.
   The proof is based on the following simple result (see Theorem 1.2).
   Theorem. Let X be a paracompact space. Suppose a space Y is the union of
   a family \{Y-s\}(sis an element ofS) of its subspaces with the following
   properties:
   (a) Each Y-s is an absolute extensor of X,
   (b) For any two elements s and t of S there is u is an element of S such
   that Y-s boolean OR Y-t subset of Y-u.
   If f : A --> Y is a map from a closed subset A to Y such that A = U-sis
   an element ofS Int(A)(f(-1) (Y-s)), then f extends over X.
   That result implies a few well-known theorems of classical theory of
   retracts which makes it of interest in its own. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {There is a growing body of research on family relationships and the
   nature of family violence in Muslim-majority countries of Asia. However,
   patterns and trends around family dynamics and violence do not remain
   static. Despite the diversity of South Asian societies, all are being
   influenced by a constellation of globalized social, economic, political
   and religious forces that manifest in unique ways in different contexts.
   To date, there is little written about the implications for women's
   rights and gendered violence when globalization remolds religious,
   cultural, geographic and other social realities. This critical review
   presents a review of feminist literature on gender, family and violence
   in Asian Muslim-majority countries - notably Pakistan, Indonesia,
   Malaysia and Bangladesh - from a feminist globalization theoretical
   perspective. The article uses the Maldives as a case study to map how
   globalized socio-economic and political trends are changing the terrain
   of family and society in ways that both advance and retract women's
   rights and contribute to their increased risk of violence. This paper
   advances the literature on feminist perspectives on family relationships
   by demonstrating the importance of considering localized problems within
   a global sphere. This approach will allow researchers to systematically
   assess the influence of global processes on changing family relations
   and implications for family structures. The paper concludes with
   applications for feminist approaches to globalization, gender and
   violence. In particular, an increased focus on global processes and the
   shifting dynamics of family relationships will better inform global
   feminist activism, and feminist activism in Asian Islamic communities.},

Title = {The influencing mechanism of drilling parameters on micro drilling
   temperature on the basis of calibration of surface emissivity of micro
   drill bit},
Journal = {CIRCUIT WORLD},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {63-68},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to calibrate the surface
   emissivity of micro drill bit and to investigate the effect of different
   drilling parameters on the temperature of micro drill bit in printed
   circuit board (PCB) micro drilling process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The surface emissivity of micro drill bit
   was obtained by experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied in
   this study to analysis the effect of different drilling parameters on
   the temperature of micro drill bit in PCB micro hole drilling. The most
   significant influencing factor on micro drill bit temperature was
   achieved by ANOVA.
   Findings - First, the surface emissivity of cemented carbide rod
   decreased from 0.4 to 0.32 slowly with temperature in the range of
   50-220 degrees C. Second, the most significant influencing factor on the
   micro drill bit temperature was spindle speed among the drilling
   parameters including spindle speed, retract rate and infeed rate.
   Research limitations/implications - In this paper, the influence of
   roughness of black coating, carbide rod and micro drill bit on the
   surface emissivity calibration and the temperature measurement was not
   considered.
   Originality/value - A new simple method has been presented to calibrate
   the surface emissivity of micro drill bit. Through calibrating the
   surface emissivity of micro drill bit, the temperature of micro drill
   bit can be measured accurately by infrared thermometry. Analyzing the
   influences of different drilling parameters on the temperature of micro
   drill bit, the mechanism of drilling parameters on drilling temperature
   is achieved. The basis for the selection of drilling parameters to
   improve the hole quality is enhanced.},

Title = {``Velaria{''} in ancient Roman theatres: Can they have an acoustic role?},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {95},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {98-105},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {In the early Imperial age Roman unroofed theatres were endowed with
   velaria. Velaria were awnings made of sailcloth, in either canvas, linen
   or cotton, attached to spokes of rope that could be extended or
   retracted with ropes and pulleys over the cavea. Their main purpose was
   to provide shade for the spectators who watched the show in blistering
   sun and heat. The aim of this paper is to understand if velaria, beside
   their primary function, could affect the acoustics of the theatres. A
   specific study was carried out with the use of a commercial software for
   the prediction of room-acoustics characteristics of halls. Actually,
   numerical simulations were aided by acoustic measurements performed in
   two existing theatres, namely the ``Teatro Grande{''} in Pompeii and the
   ``Teatro Romano{''} in Benevento as they are in the present state. Both
   theatres are used rather regularly for public shows including music of
   various genres and drama. Like other ancient theatres not in a good
   state of conservation both theatres are deficient of natural
   reverberation because of the lack of structural elements important for
   this acoustic feature. To overcome inherent drawbacks electroacoustic
   means are used. However, there are instances where these remedial
   measures are not appropriate. The results of this study show that the
   use of suitable awnings can improve the reverberation in these venues.

Title = {Rotor Position Synchronization in Central-Converter Multi-Motor Electric
   Actuation Systems},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The aerospace industry is increasingly transitioning from hydraulic and
   pneumatic drives to power-electronic based drive systems for reduced
   weight and maintenance. Electromechanical thrust reverse actuation
   systems (EM-TRAS) are currently being considered as a replacement for
   mechanical based TRAS for future aircraft. An EM-TRAS consists of one or
   more power-electronic drives, electrical motors, and gear-trains that
   extend/retract mechanical members to produce a drag force that
   decelerates the aircraft upon landing. The use of a single ( ``central
   ``) power electronic converter to simultaneously control a set of
   parallel induction machines is a potentially inexpensive and robust
   method for implementing EM-TRAS. However, because the electrical motors
   may experience different shaft torques-arising from differences in wind
   forces and a flexible nacelle-a method to implement rotor position
   synchronization in central-converter multi-motor (CCMM) architectures is
   needed. This paper introduces a novel method for achieving position
   synchronization within CCMM architecture by using closed-loop feedback
   of variable stator resistances in parallel induction machines. The
   feasibility of the method is demonstrated in several case studies using
   electromagnetic transient simulation on a set of parallel induction
   machines experiencing different load torque conditions, with the central
   converter implementing both voltage-based and current-based primary
   control strategies. The key result of the paper is that the CCMM
   architecture with proposed feedback control strategy is shown in these
   case studies to dynamically drive the position synchronization error to
   zero. The initial findings indicate that the CCMM architecture with
   induction motors may be a viable option for implementing EM-TRAS in
   future aircraft.},

Journal = {NANOSCALE},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {8843-8857},
Abstract = {We report an in vivo electromechanical atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   study of charge distribution on the cell wall of Gram+ Rhodococcus
   wratislaviensis bacteria, naturally adherent to a glass substrate, under
   physiological conditions. The method presented in this paper relies on a
   detailed study of AFM approach/retract curves giving the variation of
   the interaction force versus distance between the tip and the sample. In
   addition to classical height and mechanical (as stiffness) data, mapping
   of local electrical properties, such as bacterial surface charge, was
   proved to be feasible at a spatial resolution better than a few tens of
   nanometers. This innovative method relies on the measurement of the
   cantilever's surface stress through its deflection far from (>10 nm) the
   repulsive contact zone: the variations of surface stress come from the
   modification of electrical surface charge of the cantilever (as in
   classical electrocapillary measurements) likely stemming from its
   charging during contact of both the tip and the sample electrical double
   layers. This method offers an important improvement in local electrical
   and electrochemical measurements at the solid/liquid interface,
   particularly in high-molarity electrolytes when compared to techniques
   focused on the direct use of electrostatic force. It thus opens a new
   way to directly investigate in situ biological electrical surface
   processes involved in numerous practical applications and fundamental
   problems such as bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, microbial fuel
   cells, etc.},

Abstract = {Psychopharmacology has had some bad publicity lately. Frankly, there
   have been some major problems along the way in developing new effective
   drugs for psychiatric disorders. After a prolonged period of high
   investments but low success rates, big pharmaceutical companies seem to
   retract their activities in the psychopharmacology field. Yet, the
   burden of mental disorders is likely to keep on growing in the next
   decades. In this position paper, we focus on drug development for
   depression and anxiety disorders, to narrow the scope of the assay. We
   describe the current situation of the psychopharmacology field, and
   analyse some of the methods and paradigms that have brought us here, but
   which should perhaps change to bring us even further. In addition, some
   of the factors contributing to the current stagnation in
   psychopharmacology are discussed. Finally, we suggest a number of
   changes that could lead to a more rational strategy for central nervous
   system drug development and which may circumvent some of the pitfalls
   leading to ``me too{''} approaches. Central to the suggested changes, is
   the notion that mental disorders do not lead to several symptoms, but a
   network of causally related symptoms convolutes into a mental disorder.
   We call upon academia to put these changes in the early phases of drug
   development into effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the present paper was to study the long-term
   clinical results with ceramic-veneered Procera titanium copings.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 44 titanium copings (fabricated for 22
   patients) veneered with a low-fusing ceramic were followed for 60 to 78
   months. The clinical examinations were performed by licensed specialists
   in prosthetic dentistry. The crowns were rated according to the
   California Dental Association system. In addition, Bleeding Index and
   Margin Index were also evaluated. Results: In 3 crowns ceramic fractures
   necessitated their replacement. Two crowns had to be replaced because of
   caries. The ratings for surface and color had changed markedly, from
   excellent to acceptable. Regarding anatomic form, with the exception of
   the 3 fractured ceramic crowns, there were no obvious changes. The
   margin integrity, aside from the 2 crowned teeth with caries, was
   recorded as satisfactory (excellent or acceptable) for all other crowns;
   in fact, a large majority were rated excellent. Regarding Bleeding
   index, there were no differences between crowned teeth and control
   teeth. Changes in Margin Index showed that the gingiva of the crowned
   teeth had retracted. Conclusion: Of the various clinical factors
   evaluated, only surface and color-related to the low-fusing ceramic used
   for veneering-showed any obvious change during the follow-up period.
   Otherwise the veneered titanium copings had, in general, performed well.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C},

Abstract = {Self-reproduction on asynchronous cellular automata (ACAs) has attracted
   wide attention due to the evident artifacts induced by synchronous
   updating. Asynchronous updating, which allows cells to undergo
   transitions independently at random times, might be more compatible with
   the natural processes occurring at micro-scale, but the dark side of the
   coin is the increment in the complexity of an ACA in order to accomplish
   stable self-reproduction. This paper proposes a novel model of
   self-timed cellular automata (STCAs), a special type of ACAs, where
   unsheathed loops are able to duplicate themselves reliably in parallel.
   The removal of sheath cannot only allow various loops with more flexible
   and compact structures to replicate themselves, but also reduce the
   number of cell states of the STCA as compared to the previous model
   adopting sheathed loops {[}Y. Takada, T. Isokawa, F. Peper and N.
   Matsui, Physica D 227, 26 (2007)]. The lack of sheath, on the other
   hand, often tends to cause much more complicated interactions among
   loops, when all of them struggle independently to stretch out their
   constructing arms at the same time. In particular, such intense
   collisions may even cause the emergence of a mess of twisted
   constructing arms in the cellular space. By using a simple and natural
   method, our self-reproducing loops (SRLs) are able to retract their arms
   successively, thereby disentangling from the mess successfully.},

Title = {Sequent-Type Calculi for Three-Valued and Disjunctive Default Logic},
Journal = {AXIOMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Default logic is one of the basic formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning,
   a well-established area from logic-based artificial intelligence dealing
   with the representation ofrational conclusions, which are characterised
   by the feature that the inference process may require to retract prior
   conclusions given additional premisses. This nonmonotonic aspect is in
   contrast tovalid inference relations, which are monotonic. Although
   nonmonotonic reasoning has been extensively studied in the literature,
   only few works exist dealing with a proper proof theory for specific
   logics. In this paper, we introduce sequent-type calculi for two
   variants of default logic, viz., on the one hand, forthree-valued
   default logicdue to Radzikowska, and on the other hand, fordisjunctive
   default logic, due to Gelfond, Lifschitz, Przymusinska, and
   Truszczynski. The first variant of default logic employs Lukasiewicz's
   three-valued logic as the underlying base logic and the second variant
   generalises defaults by allowing a selection of consequents in defaults.
   Both versions have been introduced to address certain representational
   shortcomings of standard default logic. The calculi we introduce
   axiomatisebrave reasoningfor these versions of default logic, which is
   the task of determining whether a given formula is contained in some
   extension of a given default theory. Our approach follows the sequent
   method first introduced in the context of nonmonotonic reasoning by
   Bonatti, which employs arejection calculusfor axiomatising invalid
   formulas, taking care of expressing the consistency condition of
   defaults.},

Abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been applied to measure inter- or
   intra-molecular forces acting to hold biological molecules and
   structures. For these measurements, it is important to keep the target
   molecules biologically active on a solid surface. Besides the strategy
   for immobilizing them on the surface keeping their biological activities
   intact, it is crucial to reduce the force applied to them through the
   AFM tip to avoid mechanical inactivation of the sample. In this paper,
   we propose a new procedure to minimize the effect of contact force. The
   first step of the procedure is to bring the cantilever tip close to the
   sample surface within less than 3 mum, but short of contact with the
   sample surface. The approximate distance of the tip from the sample
   stage is measured using the thermal fluctuation of the cantilever. The
   second step is a ``compression-free{''} force spectroscopy for the
   measurement of protein-protein interactions only, which is possible when
   the piezo scanner was retracted before the cantilever starts upward
   deflection. The interaction force can be measured in the retraction
   period provided a physical contact is established between the proteins
   on the tip and the substrate. This procedure allowed to measure
   interaction forces between GroEL and a denatured protein without
   mechanical deformation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Development of pollen dyads in Polypleurum munnarense Nagendran \&
   Arekal (Podostemaceae): Insights into the plant's reproductive strategy},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {305},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Riverweeds (Podostemaceae) are one of a kind among angiosperms owing to
   their deviant ecological, morphological and embryological features.
   Podostemaceae is well-known for rare occurrences of pollen grains as
   dyads. However, little is known about the development of pollen in a
   dyad. This paper highlights the key developmental events of dyad pollen
   in one of the endemic taxa of riverweeds (Polypleurum munnarense)
   through anatomical and ultrastructural studies. The study shows that the
   pollen in the species are acalymate, tricolpate and are connected
   through cytomictic channels. These channels are open during the initial
   stages of development. By mitosis I stage, the channels are completely
   obliterated due to deposition of the orbicular material. Pollen wall
   possesses a multi-layered microechinate exine consisting of a continuous
   tectum except in the colpus region, granular infratectum and a
   foot-layer. The dyads disperse at bi-celled stage and their wall
   retracts from the colpus regions, showing harmomegathic movements, that
   are aided by the granular infratectum of the exine. X-ray spectral
   analysis revealed the presence of signaling molecules in granular
   microechinate orbicules and pollenkitt, indicating their possible
   involvement in pollen development. Most of the features of pollen
   development recorded in the study seem to be adaptive in countering
   rapid temperature fluctuations that the plant experiences in its
   partially submerged habitat during flowering, and thus help it in its
   reproductive endeavours.},

Title = {Preliminary Design Method and Prototype Testing of a Novel Rotors
   Retractable Hybrid VTOL UAV},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {161141-161160},
Abstract = {Conventional hybrid VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft are
   always designed by directly mounting multicopter rotors onto a
   fixed-wing plane. This type of VTOL aircraft may suffer from terrible
   drag due to the copter rotors. To tackle this problem, this paper
   describes a novel rotors retractable hybrid VTOL UAV (RR VTOL) that
   combines the hovering capability of multicopters and the high cruise
   velocity property of pure fixed-wing aircraft. Computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) analysis on rotors folding and unfolding models proves
   that the retractable rotors can increase the lift-to-drag ratio by
   approximately two times compared to that of the common hybrid VTOL UAV.
   Moreover, some aerodynamic performance data of the rotors folded model
   are also acquired. A preliminary design method for this creative UAV is
   proposed with new empirical equations derived from many hybrid VTOL
   UAVs' data. Emphasis is given to the method for determining the center
   of gravity position and horizontal tail dimensions as they are the
   unique aspects of the RR VTOL configuration. Subsequently, the
   manufacturing process and rotor retraction mechanism of two UAV
   generations are reviewed and a rapid prototyping method for RR VTOL is
   summarized. Finally, a successful flight test confirms that the proposed
   VTOL concept is practical and the drag reduction of rotors retracting
   function is remarkable.},

Title = {2-polyhedra for which every homotopy domination over itself is a
   homotopy equivalence},
Journal = {TOPOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {207},
Pages = {54-61},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {We consider an open question: Is it true that each homotopy domination
   of a polyhedron over itself is a homotopy equivalence? The answer is
   known to be positive for 1-dimensional polyhedra and polyhedra with
   virtually-polycyclic fundamental groups, so it is natural to ask about
   2-dimensional polyhedra, in particular about those with solvable
   fundamental groups.
   In this paper we prove that for each 2-dimensional polyhedron P with
   weakly Hopfian fundamental group, every homotopy domination of P over
   itself is a homotopy equivalence. A group is weakly Hopfian if it is not
   isomorphic to a proper retract of itself. Thus every Hopfian group is
   weakly Hopfian.
   The class of Hopfian groups contains: all torsion-free hyperbolic
   groups, finitely generated linear groups, knot groups, limit groups, and
   many others.
   One corollary to the main result is that for 2-dimensional polyhedra
   with elementary amenable (including virtually-solvable) fundamental
   groups of finite cohomological dimension, the answer to our question is
   positive (we show that every elementary amenable group with finite
   cohomological dimension is Hopfian).
   The problem in consideration is related in an obvious way to the famous
   question of K. Borsuk (1967): Is it true that two compact ANR's homotopy
   dominating each other have the same homotopy type? (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {FUNDAMENTA MATHEMATICAE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {223},
Number = {2},
Pages = {99-136},
Abstract = {For every n >= 2, let cc(R-n) denote the hyperspace of all nonempty
   compact convex subsets of the Euclidean space R-n endowed with the
   Hausdorff metric topology. Let cb(R-n) be the subset of cc(R-n)
   consisting of all compact convex bodies. In this paper we discover
   several fundamental properties of the natural action of the affine group
   Aff(n) on cb(R-n). We prove that the space E(n) of all n-dimensional
   ellipsoids is an Aff(n)-equivariant retract of cb(R-n). This is applied
   to show that cb(R-n) is homeomorphic to the product Q x Rn(n+3)/2, where
   Q stands for the Hilbert cube. Furthermore, we investigate the action of
   the orthogonal group O(n) on cc(R-n). In particular, we show that if K
   subset of O(n) is a closed subgroup that acts nontransitively on the
   unit sphere Sn-1, then the orbit space cc(R-n)/K is homeomorphic to the
   Hilbert cube with a point removed, while cb(R-n)/K is a contractible
   Q-manifold homeomorphic to the product (E(n)/K) x Q. The orbit space
   cb(R-n)/Aff(n) is homeomorphic to the BanachMazur compactum BM(n), while
   cc(R-n)/O(n) is homeomorphic to the open cone over BM(n).},

Abstract = {From stadium covers to solar sails, we rely on deployability for the
   design of large-scale structures that can quickly compress to a fraction
   of their size(1-4). Historically, two main strategies have been used to
   design deployable systems. The first and most frequently used approach
   involves mechanisms comprising interconnected bar elements, which can
   synchronously expand and retract(5-7), occasionally locking in place
   through bistable elements(8,9). The second strategy makes use of
   inflatable membranes that morph into target shapes by means of a single
   pressure input(10-12.) Neither strategy, however, can be readily used to
   provide an enclosed domain that is able to lock in place after
   deployment: the integration of a protective covering in linkage-based
   constructions is challenging and pneumatic systems require a constant
   applied pressure to keep their expanded shape(13-15). Here we draw
   inspiration from origami-the Japanese art of paper folding-to design
   rigid-walled deployable structures that are multistable and inflatable.
   Guided by geometric analyses and experiments, we create a library of
   bistable origami shapes that can be deployed through a single fluidic
   pressure input. We then combine these units to build functional
   structures at the metre scale, such as arches and emergency shelters,
   providing a direct route for building large-scale inflatable systems
   that lock in place after deployment and offer a robust enclosure through
   their stiff faces.},

Title = {Development and Performance of a Battery-Free Disaster Prevention Radio
   ``HOOPRA{''} Using the Energy Harvested from Radio Waves},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {A battery-free radio receiver, HOOPRA (hoop type radio), is proposed for
   acquiring information using middle wave AM radio broadcasting during
   unexpected power failures or disasters, with emphasis on wide coverage,
   immediate information acquisition, and energy saving. The HOOPRA
   utilizes middle waves for energy harvesting. As this radio is intended
   for use during disasters, the protection methods, receiving performance,
   and the applications of energy harvesting are reported in this paper.
   The HOOPRA is ring-shaped with a diameter of 20 cm when retracted, for
   portability and 60 cm when expanded, for usage and is lightweight (180
   g). The HOOPRA works on the principle of a crystal radio but has an
   adequate receiving performance without an external antenna that is
   generally necessary for crystal radios and is portable. It could receive
   a radio broadcast within an area of radius 15 km from a transmitting
   station of the NHK Fukui Daiichi Broadcasting (JOFG, 5 kW). Further, the
   energy harvested from the middle waves utilizing the high sensitivity of
   the HOOPRA was found to light-up a white LED. In a field test with the
   HOOPRA, it was found that the receiving sensitivity was particularly
   enhanced near a tall building, probably owing to the diffraction effect
   of the radio waves. Use of this effect for enhancing the sensitivity of
   the battery-free radio is also explained.},

Title = {Cortical Factor Feedback Model for Cellular Locomotion and Cytofission},
Journal = {PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Eukaryotic cells can move spontaneously without being guided by external
   cues. For such spontaneous movements, a variety of different modes have
   been observed, including the amoeboid-like locomotion with protrusion of
   multiple pseudopods, the keratocyte-like locomotion with a widely spread
   lamellipodium, cell division with two daughter cells crawling in
   opposite directions, and fragmentations of a cell to multiple pieces.
   Mutagenesis studies have revealed that cells exhibit these modes
   depending on which genes are deficient, suggesting that seemingly
   different modes are the manifestation of a common mechanism to regulate
   cell motion. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that the positive
   feedback mechanism working through the inhomogeneous distribution of
   regulatory proteins underlies this variety of cell locomotion and
   cytofission. In this hypothesis, a set of regulatory proteins, which we
   call cortical factors, suppress actin polymerization. These suppressing
   factors are diluted at the extending front and accumulated at the
   retracting rear of cell, which establishes a cellular polarity and
   enhances the cell motility, leading to the further accumulation of
   cortical factors at the rear. Stochastic simulation of cell movement
   shows that the positive feedback mechanism of cortical factors
   stabilizes or destabilizes modes of movement and determines the cell
   migration pattern. The model predicts that the pattern is selected by
   changing the rate of formation of the actin-filament network or the
   threshold to initiate the network formation.},

Abstract = {The type of actuator described in this paper can provide constant
   velocity motion with extremely small following error (less than 20 nm).
   However, the speed of translation is limited by the size, and therefore
   the stroke, of the piezoelectric actuator. Two designs have been
   developed, one with a large high-voltage actuator (25 mm long, 25 mum
   stroke at 1000v) and the other with a miniature low-voltage actuator (4
   mm long, 3 mum stroke at 60v). The maximum speed capability is a direct
   function of the stroke of the actuator, the expand/retract frequency of
   the piezoelectric actuators and the natural frequency of the structure.
   Since the natural frequency of the structure will be on the order of 500
   Hz, the maximum operating frequency should be less than half of that
   value to avoid large structural vibrations and therefore large following
   errors. Therefore, the limiting speed can be estimated as:
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   For the large actuator the maximum speed from this expression would be
   on the order of 6 mm/sec and 1 mm/sec for the smaller one. While not
   measured at the theoretical limit, the two actuators behave as expected
   and the larger one was operated at 3 mm/sec with a +/-2 mum following
   error and the smaller one operated up to 0.3 mm/sec with a similar
   following error.},

Title = {Droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces fully decorated with
   cylindrical macrotextures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {509},

Abstract = {Hypothesis: Impacting on a superhydrophobic surface, water droplet
   spreads to a pancake shape and then retracts and bounces off. Although
   the collision time is mostly in the order of couple of 10 ms for
   milli-metric droplets, researchers have shown recently that decorating
   the superhydrophobic surface with a single macrotexture or intersecting
   ridge reduces this contact time if the droplet hits the texture or the
   intersection exactly in the center. Hence, covering the surface with
   ridges should address this hitting point restriction.
   Experiments: Using an extruder-type 3D printer, we fabricated a
   superhydrophobic surface fully decorated with cylindrical ridges. The
   dynamic of water droplet impact on this surface at different impact
   velocities has been studied for varied droplet volumes and ridge sizes.
   Findings: Our data show that regardless of the location of the contact
   point, when the kinetic energy of the drop is sufficient to completely
   wet the ridges, the contact time reduces similar to 13\% as the
   consequence of similar to 20\% faster retraction. For higher impact
   velocity, the contact becomes shorter since the flattened drop splashes
   from the periphery. Moreover, the simplified, time-efficient and
   inexpensive method of fabricating the surfaces presented in this paper
   can be implemented in fabricating many versatile superhydrophobic
   surfaces with complex geometries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {A duplicate publication, or parts thereof, without disclosure, is now
   definitively considered to be an ethical infraction. The amount of
   duplication usually determines the correction that is necessary, either
   an erratum or a retraction. Such duplications can exist as a result of
   error, misconduct, or even gray areas in between. In the highly
   competitive market of scholarly and academic publishing, there exists
   constant pressure, and thus temptation, to boost output. Academics who
   are not native English speakers, or who publish in journals whose
   primary language is not English, may also consider publishing their data
   sets in their native language. There are increasing cases of duplicated
   data and papers in the English literature that have been corrected or
   retracted as a result of undeclared prior publication in another journal
   and language. This letter explores some of the discussion points
   surrounding duplicate publications in two languages. Provided that
   multiple sources in two or more languages that report the same data,
   text, ideas, concepts, methodologies or analyses are clearly
   cross-referenced, thereby alerting the editors, peers and readers that
   such aspects have been previously published, there is a reduced risk of
   an ethical infraction. In fact, secondary publications in two or more
   languages could benefit a wider pool of scientists. However, undeclared
   duplications, whole or in part, are considered to be ethical
   infractions.},

Title = {Emittance compensation schemes for a superconducting rf injector},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW ACCELERATORS AND BEAMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 18},
Abstract = {Contemporary particle injector technologies provide different advantages
   depending on the chosen design. In the case of copper rf injectors these
   is primarily the high accelerating field, enabling the generation of
   high charge bunches with very low emittance. However, the cost of that
   is a comparably low repetition rate. DC guns, on the other hand, can
   provide higher repetition rates and consequently increased beam currents
   at lower beam quality, i.e., increased emittance. The concept of a
   superconducting rf injector offers the opportunity to combine the
   advantages of both these concepts. However, it demands special concepts
   for emittance compensation, as the common approach with overlapping
   magnetic fields during the rf acceleration interferes with the
   limitations of superconductivity. The ELBE SRF Gun project is one of the
   most advanced in this field. Gun II, the second SRF injector at the
   Electron Linear accelerator with high Brilliance and low Emittance
   (ELBE), introduces new features for emittance compensation which were
   studied in detail over the last years. One of these methods is the
   integration of a superconducting solenoid into the cryostat. Another
   method uses rf focusing by retracting the photocathode's tip from the
   last cell of the resonator. This paper discusses both of these schemes
   by briefly outlining their setups, discussing results of numerical
   simulations of their impact, and presenting results of initial
   experimental beam measurements with Gun II.},

Title = {Magnetic Field Effects on Backward-Facing Step Flow of Ferrofluids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Backward-facing step (BFS) flow is a benchmark case study in fluid
   mechanics. Its control by means of electromagnetic actuation has
   attracted great interest in recent years. This paper focuses on the
   effects of a uniform stationary magnetic field on the laminar ferrofluid
   BFS flows for the Reynolds number range 0.1 <= Re <= 400 and different
   expansion ratios. The coupled ferrohydrodynamic equations, including the
   microscopically derived magnetization equation, for a two-dimensional
   domain are solved numerically by an OPENFOAM solver after validation and
   a test of accuracy. The application of a magnetic field causes the
   corner vortices in the concave corner behind the step to be retracted
   compared with their positions in the absence of a magnetic field. The
   maximum percentage of the normalized decrease in length of these eddies
   reaches 41.23\% in our simulations. For small Reynolds numbers (<10),
   the flow separation points on the convex corner are lowered in the
   presence of a magnetic field. Furthermore, the dimensionless total
   pressure drop between the channel inlet and outlet decreases almost
   linearly with Reynolds number Re, but the drop is greater when a
   magnetic field is applied. On the whole, the normalized recirculation
   length of the corner vortex increases nonlinearly with increasing
   magnetic Reynolds number Re-m and Brownian Pieclet number Pe, but it
   tends to constant values in the limits Re-m << 1 and Re-m >> 1.},

Title = {University autonomy under democratic backsliding: a case study of a

Abstract = {Scholars have documented a tendency of (semi-)authoritarian regimes to
   undermine university autonomy, mainly through organizational (de jure)
   changes. This paper presents a case study of a publicly triggered
   plagiarism investigation by the University of Belgrade into the doctoral
   thesis of the Serbian Minister of Finance, one of the key members of the
   increasingly authoritarian regime. The analysis finds a proceduralized
   and delayed response of the university's leadership, which indicates
   lowered de facto autonomy from politics, despite the university's
   continually high de jure autonomy. The investigation was closed only
   after a mobilization within the academic community which resulted in a
   university's blockade that forced its leadership to retract the
   contentious thesis. The case study shows that, in contexts of democratic
   backsliding, political capture can extend farther than usually thought,
   impacting even the implementation of internal university standards. On
   the other hand, the analysis also shows that political capture is not
   necessarily irreversible and that academic community can mobilize to
   `undo' it. This reinforces the notion of academic communities as
   value-driven groups capable of exerting peer pressure to override even
   authoritarian pressures. In order to understand the dynamic of the
   plagiarism inquiry in its entirety, we apply insights from theory of
   power to complement and overcome the limitations of the conventional
   theoretical frameworks on democratic backsliding and academic autonomy.},

Title = {An Experimental Characterization on the Acoustic Performance of
   Forward/Rearward Retraction of a Nose Landing Gear},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {The modern undercarriage system of a large aircraft normally requires
   the landing gear to be retractable. The nose landing gear, installed in
   the front of the fuselage, is retracted either forward or rearward. In
   the forward/rearward retraction system, the landing gear is normally
   installed to the trailing/leading side of the bay. When the incoming
   flow passes the landing gear as well as the bay, the installation that
   corresponds to the forward/rearward retraction system has a significant
   impact on the coupling flow and the associated noise of the landing gear
   and the bay. In this paper, acoustic performance of the forward/rearward
   retraction of the nose landing gear was discussed based on experiment.
   The landing gear bay was simplified as a rectangular cavity, and tests
   were conducted in an aeroacoustics wind tunnel. The cavity oscillation
   was first analyzed with different incoming speeds. Then, the landing
   gear model was installed close to the trailing and the leading side of
   the cavity, respectively. It was observed that installation close to the
   leading side can help disturb the shear layer so as to suppress the
   oscillation, while the trailing one can make the landing gear itself
   produce lower noise. Accordingly, conclusions on the acoustic
   performance of the forward/rearward retraction of the nose landing gear
   are made.},

Abstract = {Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has gradually become the most
   common treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in clinical practice
   due to its advantages of small trauma and quick recovery. However, the
   availability of hospitals with cardiac catheterization facilities and
   trained interventionalists is extremely limited in remote and
   underdeveloped areas. Remote vascular robotic system can assist
   interventionalists to complete operations precisely, and reduce
   occupational health hazards occurrence. In this paper, a bionic remote
   vascular robot is introduced in detail from three parts: mechanism,
   communication architecture, and controller model. Firstly, human
   finger-like mechanisms in vascular robot enable the interventionalists
   to advance, retract and rotate the guidewires or balloons. Secondly, a
   5G-based communication system is built to satisfy the end-to-end
   requirements of strong data transmission and packet priority setting in
   remote robot control. Thirdly, a generalized predictive controller (GPC)
   is developed to suppress the effect of time-varying network delay and
   parameter identification error, while adding a designed polynomial
   compensation module to reduce tracking error and improve system
   responsiveness. Then, the simulation experiment verifies the system
   performance in comparison with different algorithms, network delay, and
   packet loss rate. Finally, the improved control system conducted PCI on
   an experimental pig, which reduced the delivery integral absolute error
   (IAE) by at least 20\% compared with traditional methods.},

Abstract = {We report in this paper a solar eruptive event, in which a vertical
   current sheet (VCS) is observed in the wake of an erupting flux rope in
   the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
   131 A passband. The VCS is first detected following the impulsive
   acceleration of the erupting flux rope but prior to the onset of a
   non-thermal hard X-ray (HXR)/microwave burst, with plasma blobs moving
   upwards at speeds up to 1400 km s(-1) along the sheet. The timing
   suggests that the VCS with plasma blobs might not be the primary
   accelerator for non-thermal electrons emitting HXRs/microwaves. The
   initial, slow acceleration of the erupting structure is associated with
   the slow elevation of a thermal looptop HXR source and the subsequent,
   impulsive acceleration is associated with the downward motion of the
   looptop source. We find that the plasma blobs moving downwards within
   the VCS into the cusp region and the flare loops retracting from the
   cusp region make a continuous process, with the former apparently
   initiating the latter, which provides a 3D perspective on reconnections
   at the VCS. We also identify a dark void moving within the VCS towards
   the flare arcade, which suggests that dark voids in supra-arcade
   downflows are of the same origin as plasma blobs within the VCS.},

Abstract = {Machining of steep regions is an important research topic in the
   machining of free-form surfaces. A new tool path generation algorithm to
   adaptively machine free-form surfaces has been recently developed.
   However, similarly to many newly emerged methods, so far it has not been
   used in industry because no commercial platform is currently available
   and the user-developed system is not robust enough for industrial
   applications. To solve this problem, this paper presents a new
   implementation method by integrating it in a commercial CAD/CAM system
   (Pro/Engineer). With this strategy, other than conducts detailed
   computations for parameters, such as scallop heights and forward steps,
   or designing the non-cutting functions such as engaging and retracting
   methods, which are routines in every tool path generation process, the
   implementation utilizes existing tool path generation templates in Pro/E
   to generate the required tool paths. This makes the tool path generation
   process easier and the tool paths generated more practicable because the
   integration is relieved of the time-consuming routine calculation and
   the entire cutting and non-cutting functions in the commercial system
   are transparent to users. Based on the API of Pro/E, the new tool path
   generation method was successfully implemented and cutting tests were
   conducted. Not losing generality, the implementation could also be
   conducted in other commercial systems as similar templates are available
   in these systems as well.},

Abstract = {The parameters are described that characterise the exposure of the users
   of cellular phones. The parameters are distinguished in two classes: the
   human and the cell phone parameters. Among the human parameters the
   following are discussed: size and shape of head and neck, manner of
   holding the phone: (left vs, right, finger tips vs. palm contact) and
   phone position on the face of the user. The cell phone parameters
   causing the: largest exposure variations are: antenna geometry (size,
   shape, extended or retracted) and matching conditions; operating RF
   power level; proximity of tissue to RF currents on metal parts, channel
   access method (analogue, pulsed, CDMA). The large variability of the RF
   exposure is further expanded by the variety (ever increasing) of phone
   models available to users who may change service frequently or
   sporadically. After a brief discussion of possible dose definitions and
   the uncertainty of the `user' of a cell phone for a specific call, the
   paper analyses the critical exposure parameters that should be
   investigated to characterise statistically the RF exposure of the
   subjects of an epidemiological study. The improved exposure assessment
   of the users of cellular phones requires the cooperation of network
   operators and equipment manufacturers. The statistics of the most
   critical parameters, those with variability greater that 10:1, can be
   collected by modifying the software and hardware of the cell phone
   equipment. The paper suggests base station software modifications and
   the introduction of cell phone `dosemeter' devices that record some of
   the critical exposure parameters. A certain number of these `dosemeters'
   should be distributed among subscribers to determine the statistical
   variations of the RF exposure from cell phones. The paper concludes by
   recommending a pilot dosimetric study independent from any
   epidemiological study.},

   3D, possibly inhomogeneous layer of tissue. We present an algorithm that
   computes a set of stable and secure grasp-and-retract trajectories for a
   point-jaw gripper moving along a plane, and runs a 3D finite element
   (FEM) simulation to certify and assess the quality of each trajectory.
   To compute secure candidate grasp locations, we use a continuous spring
   model of thin, inhomogeneous deformable objects with linear energy
   potential. Experiments show that this method produces many of the same
   grasps as an exhaustive optimization with an FEM mesh, but is orders of
   magnitude cheaper: our method runs in O(v log v) time, where v is the
   number of veins, while the FEM computation takes O(pn(3)) time, where n
   is the number of nodes in the FEM mesh and p is the number of nodes on
   its perimeter. Furthermore, we present a constant tissue curvature (CTC)
   retraction trajectory that distributes strain uniformly around the
   medial axis of the tissue. 3D FEM simulations show that the CTC achieves
   retractions with lower tissue strain than circular and linear
   trajectories. Overall, our algorithm computes and certifies a
   high-quality retraction in about one minute on a PC.},

Abstract = {The true identity of florigen - the molecule(s) that migrates from
   leaves to apical meristem to initiate flowering - was notoriously
   elusive, having made it almost the ``Bigfoot{''} of plant biology. There
   was never a lack of drama in the field of florigen study, and florigen
   researchers have once again experienced such a swing in the last two
   years. We wrote a minireview last year in this journal (Yu et al. 2006)
   to excitedly salute, among other discoveries, the notion that the
   flowering locus T (FT) mRNA might be the molecular form of a florigen.
   However, this hypothesis was challenged in a little less than two years
   after its initial proposition, and the original paper proposed that the
   FT mRNA hypothesis was retracted (Huang et al. 2005 Bohlenius et al.
   2007). Interestingly enough, the FT gene previously proposed to encode a
   florigen was never challenged. Rather, the FT protein, instead of the FT
   mRNA, is now believed to migrate from leaves to the apical meristem to
   promote floral initiation. In this update, we will share with our
   readers some entertaining stories concerning the recent studies of
   florigen in five different plant species. In addition to the published
   reports referenced in this update, readers may also refer to our
   previous minireview and references therein for additional background
   information (Yu et al. 2006).},

Abstract = {In view of the long time of passing the ship locks, this paper designs a
   new type of semi-submersible carrier. This carrier adopts electric
   propulsion drive, which can carry 4-6 ships at a time through the ship
   lock, shortening the crossing time; For the electric energy supplement
   problem caused by the semi-submersible ship adopting the electric
   propulsion system, this paper has designed a set of ship charging system
   in the gate. This system realizes the rapid charging during the lifting
   process of the internal carrier at the gate through the ship-end power
   receiving device, the shore power supply device and the tension
   self-sensing cable retracting device. For the lack of security measures
   and the means of monitoring the bottom of the dirt, this research has
   designed a new type of ship bottom visual monitoring system, which is
   realized by setting up a professional imaging device on the
   semi-submersible ship to collect clear image of the ship bottom, and
   assists the gate security personnel to realize the rapid and accurate
   monitoring of the explosives at the bottom of the ship, the damage of
   the bottom of the ship and the fouling of the ship. For the problem that
   the current ship support platform is not adaptive to all types of ships
   is not strong, this work designs an adaptive ship support platform that
   will be adaptive hydraulic support and semi-submersible The combination
   of carrier ships enables adaptive support for different ship types,
   ensuring stability during the process of passing the ship, and reducing
   the stress concentration at the bottom of the ship.},

Title = {Drop Impact on Two-Tier Monostable Superrepellent Surfaces},

Abstract = {Superrepellency is a favorable nonwetting scenario featuring a dramatic
   reduction of the solid/liquid contact area. The robustness of
   superhydrophobicity plays a central role in self-cleaning and
   anti-icing. Drop impacts happen ubiquitously in natural environments and
   often cause a notable extension of the solid/liquid contact area. This
   is associated with an enhanced affinity between water and the
   microtextures and therefore leads to irreversible breakdowns in the
   superhydrophobicity. This problem remains a major challenge and limits
   the practical applications of superrepellent materials. In order to find
   a solution, in this paper, a repeated Cassie-Wenzel-Cassie wetting state
   transition is studied at the microscale when a drop impacts a two-tier
   superhydrophobic surface. In this case, the surface is completely dry
   without any liquid residue after the drop rebounds. The present results
   exhibit a striking contrast to the conventional perspective. The
   influence of geometrical parameters of the textured surface on the
   spreading and retracting behaviors of the impact drops is quantified, as
   well as the time-dependence scaling laws. From a practical point of
   view, it is demonstrated that the self-cleaning and dropwise
   condensation may significantly benefit from this repeated wetting
   transition. Dirt particles or small droplets in deep textures are able
   to be taken away so that the functionality and the robustness of the
   superhydrophobicity may be significantly strengthened. The results
   reported in this study facilitate the design of functional
   superrepellent materials.},

Title = {Passive Contribution of ChatGPT to Scientific Papers},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 7},
Abstract = {Arguably ChatGPT jeopardizes the integrity and validity of the academic
   publications instead of ethically facilitating them. ChatGPT can
   apparently fulfill a portion of one of the four authorship criteria set
   by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), i.e.,
   ``drafting.{''} However, the authorship criteria by ICMJE must all be
   collectively met, not singly or partially. Many published manuscripts or
   preprints have credited ChatGPT by including it in the author byline,
   and the academic publishing enterprise seems to be unguided on how to
   handle such manuscripts. Interestingly, PLoS Digital Health removed
   ChatGPT off a paper which had ChatGPT listed initially in the author
   byline of the preprint version. Revised publishing policies are, thus,
   promptly required to guide a consistent stance regarding ChatGPT or
   similar artificial content generators. Publishing policies must accord
   among publishers, preprint servers
   (https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers), universities, and research
   institutions worldwide and across different disciplines. Ideally,
   considering any declaration of the contribution of ChatGPT to writing
   any scientific article should be recognized as publishing misconduct
   immediately and be retracted. Meanwhile, all parties involved in the
   scientific reporting and publishing must be educated about how ChatGPT
   fails to meet the essential authorship criteria, so that no author must
   submit a manuscript with ChatGPT contributing as a ``co-author.{''}
   Meanwhile, using ChatGPT for writing laboratory reports or short
   summaries of experiments may be acceptable, but not for academic
   publishing or formal scientific reporting.},

Abstract = {The Tension Leg Semisubmersible (TLS) floater is the second generation
   of the Free-Hanging Solid Ballast Semisubmersible (FHSB Semi) design.
   The FHSB Semi is the state-of-the-art design that maintains the
   advantages of the conventional Semisubmersibles and provides the motions
   of Spars. The FHSB Semi design is a conventional semisubmersible with an
   added feature of a Free-Hanging Solid Ballast tank (SBT) located deep
   below the hull keel level and connected through four groups of chains
   (on its four corners) to the semisubmersible hull. During the
   pre-service conditions, the chains are used to retract the SBT and
   maintain it at a close proximity to the hull keel to facilitate the
   transportation and installation operations. Once the semisubmersible is
   moored in-place, the chain system is operated to lower the SBT to its
   desired elevation below the hull keel and maintain it permanently
   connected to the semisubmersible hull during the in-service condition.
   The SBT provides substantial in-water weight and added mass that
   significantly reduce the platform response and maintains the chains in
   tension.
   In this paper, detailed description of the Tension Leg Semisubmersible
   (TLS) design as the second generation of the FHSB Semi is presented. The
   paper also includes discussions on the proposed project execution plan
   for the TLS covering the fabrication, transportation and installation as
   well as the added risks and risk mitigations associated with the new
   semisubmersible design and execution
   A case study is introduced where a TLS is used as a dry tree host for a
   field located at 6,000 ft of water in the central Gulf of Mexico (GoM)

Abstract = {This paper reports on the latest phase of the development of a new
   rotating machinery sealing technology, which was a successful seal test
   in a high temperature steam test facility at TU Brauschweig in Germany.
   The ``Aerostatic Seal{''} is a dynamic clearance seal that is capable of
   maintaining very small clearances with a rotor and has the potential for
   a wide range of rotating machinery applications. It has been developed
   in recent years at Durham University, UK, in collaboration with a major
   OEM with a focus on steam turbine sealing, and has previously been
   reported on in a number of ASME Turbo Expo papers. Previous work has
   reported on the design tool, and two air test facilities; testing in
   steam addressed the effect of high temperature components and the
   working fluid, and was an opportunity to verify, the design system.
   The seal is a development of a retractable gland seal and so in a low
   load condition it is retracted from the rotor with a large rotor
   clearance and then when the pressure ratio is sufficient moves to an
   operational small clearance. At its operational clearance the seal is
   capable of moving with rotor vibrations which means the design clearance
   can be smaller than any expected rotor movement. The benefits include a
   significant reduction in leakage when compared to conventional sealing
   technologies and also the ability to react to large transients or
   thermal growths caused by rapid changes in machine loads and speeds. The
   seal is shown to operate well in this environment and this work moves
   the technology closer to deployment in industry},

Title = {Economic model predictive control of space heating and dynamic solar
   shading},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Dynamic solar shading devices are an effective mean to avoid overheating
   in buildings due to excessive solar heat gains. They can also be used to
   affect the heat balance of buildings; they can be on e.g. during
   nighttime to reduce space heating or retracted to increase night
   cooling. The shading control system can utilize this feature to obtain
   energy cost savings and reduce peak consumption. However, it is
   difficult to define optimal rule-based control strategies that minimize
   overheating and energy costs simultaneously. In this paper, we therefore
   propose an economic model predictive control (E-MPC) scheme for space
   heating where solar shading is included as an additional control
   variable. The proposed scheme employs black-box models, as they are
   `cheap' to create from data; this is important for a widespread
   deployment of E-MPC in practice. The study was based on co-simulation
   experiments where EnergyPlus models represented the actual building and
   it was hereby demonstrated that the proposed E-MPC outperformed two
   rule-based controllers with respect to reducing overheating, energy
   costs and peak consumption. Shading also turned out to be valuable for
   north facing rooms where it reduced costs and peak consumptions compared
   to an MPC without shading. The energy-related benefits of the proposed
   E-MPC scheme can be regarded as `an added value' that can be used for
   economic justification of an investment in dynamic solar shading
   devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach to analytically determine the most
   energy efficient toolpath strategy in mechanical machining. This was
   achieved by evaluating the electrical energy requirement of the NC codes
   generated for the zag, zigzag, and rectangular contour toolpath
   strategies. The analytical method was validated by performing pocket
   milling on AISI 1018 steel with the considered toolpaths using a 3-axis
   Takisawa Mac-V3 milling machine. The rectangular contour toolpath was
   the most efficient in terms of the electrical energy demand of the feed
   axes and cycle time. Pocket milling with the zigzag toolpath strategy
   resulted in higher electrical energy demand of the feed axes and cycle
   time by 2\% due to acceleration and deceleration characteristics of the
   machine tool feed axes execution at corners of the toolpath strategy
   adopted. Also, the electrical energy demand of the feed axes and cycle
   time for the zag toolpath were higher by 14\% and 8\%, respectively, due
   to the number of tool retracts as a result of the executed toolpath
   strategy. The experimental validation results showed good agreement with
   the analytical approach presented in this study. It can be deduced that
   for sustainable machining, the rectangular contour toolpath should be
   adopted since it has less tool retractions irrespective of the toolpath
   strategy adopted for machining. This could further enhance the selection
   of optimum green parameters by shop floor process engineers for
   sustainable manufacture of products.},

Abstract = {The quality and authenticity of images is essential for data
   presentation, especially in the life sciences. Questionable images may
   often be a first indicator for questionable results, too. Therefore, a
   tool that uses mathematical methods to detect suspicious images in large
   image archives can be a helpful instrument to improve quality assurance
   in publications. As a first step towards a systematic screening tool,
   especially for journal editors and other staff members who are
   responsible for quality assurance, such as laboratory supervisors, we
   propose a basic classification of image manipulation. Based on this
   classification, we developed and explored some simple algorithms to
   detect copied areas in images. Using an artificial image and two
   examples of previously published modified images, we apply quantitative
   methods such as pixel-wise comparison, a nearest neighbor and a variance
   algorithm to detect copied-and-pasted areas or duplicated images. We
   show that our algorithms are able to detect some simple types of image
   alteration, such as copying and pasting background areas. The variance
   algorithm detects not only identical, but also very similar areas that
   differ only by brightness. Further types could, in principle, be
   implemented in a standardized scanning routine. We detected the copied
   areas in a proven case of image manipulation in Germany and showed the
   similarity of two images in a retracted paper from the Kato labs, which
   has been widely discussed on sites such as pubpeer and retraction watch.},

Abstract = {In this paper we introduce the category Apro- ANR called the approximate
   pro-category of ANR's, whose objects are all systems of ANR's and whose
   morphisms are obtained as equivalence classes of system maps for some
   equivalence relation. We show that any 2-sink X ->(f) Z <-(g) in
   Apro-ANR admits a weak pull-back and it admits pull-back if they are
   systems of compact ANR's. Moreover, it admits `` pull-back if they are
   objects of pro- ANRU. Here ANRU is the full sub-category of the category
   Unif of uniform spaces and uniform maps, whose objects are uniform
   absolute neighborhood retracts (ANRU's) in the sense of Isbell. We
   define the approximate homotopy lifting property (AHLP) for morphisms in
   Apro- ANR and show that the category Apro- ANR with fibration = morphism
   with the AHLP with respect to paracompact spaces, and weak equivalence =
   morphism inducing an isomorphisms in pro- H(ANR) satisfies composition
   and factorization axioms and part of pull-back axiom for fibration
   category in the sense of Baues. Finally, we show that the limit of the
   pull-back of any 2-sink X ->(f) Z <-(g) Y in Apro- ANR consisting of
   systems of compact ANR's is a pull-back in the category Top of
   topological spaces and continuous maps, and conversely every pull-back
   in the full subcategory CH of Top whose objects are compact Hausdorff
   spaces admits an expansion which is a pull-back in Apro- ANR.},

Abstract = {As the size and complexity of software systems increase, software
   architecture and software fault-tolerance become as significant as the
   issues of choice of algorithms and data structures Prominent software
   fault tolerance methodologies are N-Version programming and the Recovery
   Block approach. Both require several versions of software to be
   developed separately. The focus of our research is in the
   telecommunication domain. Our software systems are characterized by
   their huge size (typically well over a million lines of code) and
   complexity. It is impossible to develop multiple independent versions of
   such huge software systems as required by N-Version and Recovery Block
   methods.
   This paper presents a fault-tolerance methodology and accompanying tool
   sets, Workflow-2-SDL (W2S) which makes use of the architectural
   description of the system to improve fault-tolerance. W2S method obtains
   a simulator by first constructing a formal model from a semi-formal
   architectural description, and then executing the model on top of an
   underlying engine. It has the on-line simulator,running in parallel with
   the target software system. It compares the results from the target
   system and the simulator in real-time and subsequently retract the
   target system failures.
   The current experimental results suggest that this approach can
   effectively improve the fault-tolerance of real-lime telecom control
   programs, as well as reduce the development cost as compared to the
   N-Version and Recovery Block approaches.},

Title = {Oroch vowel harmony},
Journal = {LINGUA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {128-151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper I examine vowel harmony in Oroch, a recently extinct
   Manchu-Tungusic language. Oroch vowels are subject to the interplay of
   retracted tongue root (RTR) harmony and rounding harmony. The two kinds
   of harmony have contrasting effects on neutral vowels. The front vowels
   /i/ and /ea/ are transparent to RTR harmony, while the vowels A/, /1 and
   /u/ are opaque to rounding harmony. Crucially, if the root contains only
   neutral vowels /i/ and /m/, the RTR feature of the suffix is
   unpredictable.
   This paper puts forth a Strata! OT analysis of Oroch vowel harmony,
   along the lines of Kiparsky (2000). The neutral vowels are assumed to be
   subject to RTR harmony at the word level, where the most harmonic
   candidate wins, but at the postlexical level there is a constraint
   against {[}i] bearing {[}+RTR] feature and against {[}i] bearing {[}
   RTR] feature; so on the surface the effect of RTR harmony is undone on
   transparent vowels. Thus, the trahsparency of the neutral vowels is
   predicted, as well as the distribution of suffixes with neutral roots,
   the underlying RTR specification of which spreads onto suffixes at the
   word level.
   In addition, the Strata! OT approach derives the transparency vs.
   opacity effects of the two harmonies while obeying strict locality, i.e.
   spreading is restricted to adjacent segments. This allows a more
   economic account of Oroch vowel harmony in terms of a small set of
   constraints predicting the transparency with respect to RTR harmony,
   opacity with respect to rounding harmony, and suffix variation with the
   neutral roots. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Credit scoring is a way of analyzing statistical data used in financial
   organizations and banks to acquire a person's creditworthiness. The
   bestowers generally manipulate it to decide to widen or retract credit.
   The score plays a significant role in determining the creditworthiness
   of a person and if he/she can be sanctioned a loan or not. Machine
   learning techniques help us to predict the credit score more accurately
   using classification algorithms. Few base and ensemble classification
   algorithms were used in this research to perform a comparative analysis.
   The ensemble method incorporates several base classification algorithms
   like Decision trees, Logistic Regression, Nearest neighbor, Support
   Vector Machine, etc. to achieve better results. The objective of this
   paper is to predict the credit score based on different classifier
   models and evaluate the performance of each model based on the metrics.
   A comparative analysis is done to identify the best classifier to
   predict the credit score. The evaluation metrics used for evaluating the
   model are Recall, Precision, F-measure, and Accuracy. Error measures
   like MAE and RMSE of the model were also used to evaluate the model.
   This helps us to improve the decision in identifying the more accurate
   classifier model. The dataset used for this analysis is the Australian
   credit dataset from the UCI Machine learning repository. Experimental
   results prove that the Random Forest and Extratree classifier model
   produces better accuracy in ensemble classifiers and the SVM model
   furnishes better accuracy in the base classifier.},

Title = {Semi-automated fact-checking of nucleotide sequence reagents in
   biomedical research publications: The Seek \& Blastn tool},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Nucleotide sequence reagents are verifiable experimental reagents in
   biomedical publications, because their sequence identities can be
   independently verified and compared with associated text descriptors. We
   have previously reported that incorrectly identified nucleotide sequence
   reagents are characteristic of highly similar human gene knockdown
   studies, some of which have been retracted from the literature on
   account of possible research fraud. Because of the throughput
   limitations of manual verification of nucleotide sequences, we developed
   a semi-automated fact checking tool, Seek \& Blastn, to verify the
   targeting or non-targeting status of published nucleotide sequence
   reagents. From previously described and unknown corpora of 48 and 155
   publications, respectively, Seek \& Blastn correctly extracted 304/342
   (88.9\%) and 1066/1522 (70.0\%) nucleotide sequences and a predicted
   targeting/non-targeting status. Seek \& Blastn correctly predicted the
   targeting/non-targeting status of 293/304 (96.4\%) and 988/1066 (92.7\%)
   of the correctly extracted nucleotide sequences. A total of 38/39
   (97.4\%) or 31/79 (39.2\%) Seek \& Blastn predictions of incorrect
   nucleotide sequence reagent use were correct in the two literature
   corpora. Combined Seek \& Blastn and manual analyses identified a list
   of 91 misidentified nucleotide sequence reagents, which could be built
   upon through future studies. In summary, incorrect nucleotide sequence
   reagents represent an under-recognized source of error within the
   biomedical literature, and fact checking tools such as Seek \& Blastn
   may help to identify papers and manuscripts affected by these errors.},

Title = {An Adaptive Foot Device for Increased Gait and Postural Stability in
   Lower Limb Orthoses and Exoskeletons},

Abstract = {Assistive devices and exoskeletons have critical importance for people
   with manipulative and locomotive disabilities. One of the major purposes
   of such devices when used for lower extremities is to help provide the
   postural or gait stability of the user. However, current lower extremity
   exoskeletons available lack the sufficient foot support area to
   guarantee a safe operation for the rehabilitation of patients, and
   normal posture/gait for users carrying heavy loads on backpack. As a
   result, these devices may require an intensive control effort to supply
   the posture or gait stability and can demand additional therapist help
   during rehabilitation. In this paper, we proposed a novel adaptive foot
   system to enhance the required stability of lower extremity exoskeletons
   as an add-on device. The method essentially aims to automatically extend
   the support area behind the heel during walking. The proposed adaptive
   foot system can extend passively during stance and retract during the
   toe rocker phase, which allows increased support areas during stance and
   prevent collisions to the level ground during swing. It is practical to
   implement and can be employed without necessitating an actuation power.
   The proposed wearable system will particularly be valuable in
   rehabilitation for enhancing the stability where safety of patients is
   particularly critical. It is also anticipated that the system can be a
   complementary device for current exoskeletons or humanoid robots to
   enhance their stability. A detailed description and numerical analysis
   of the stability in sagittal plane is presented for postural and gait
   cases in this paper. Experiments have been also conducted to prove the
   effectiveness of the adaptive wearable device for postural and gait
   stability.},

Title = {Droplet evaporation on pillar structured surface: A 3D lattice Boltzmann
   numerical study},
Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {226},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {In this paper, a three-dimensional symmetric lattice Boltzmann (LB)
   model is built up to investigate evaporation of a sessile droplet on
   pillar structured surfaces. Parametric effects on droplet evaporation,
   including pillar structure size, roughness, temperature and wettability,
   are studied comprehensively, with emphasis on the variations of contact
   angle, contact radius and velocity of triple-phase contact line (TPCL)
   as well as heat and mass fluxes during evaporation. Pillar structures
   are found to induce the droplet to split into spherical cap part and
   liquid film part, resulting in an evaporation mode different from that
   on a plain surface. The extent of pinning-depinning is strongly
   associated with structures when TPCL retracts between pillars.
   Increasing surface temperature can accelerate evaporation by breaking
   the constant contact angle (CCA) mode, and increasing surface roughness
   accelerates evaporation by decreasing the duration of CCA mode. The
   majority of heat and mass transfer takes place around TPCL. High
   wettability can facilitate the evaporation of spherical cap due to the
   meniscus at liquid-vapor interface in the vicinity of pillar top
   surface. The substrate heat flux directly affected by structure size is
   higher in the region where pillars are distributed, and the solid-liquid
   interfacial heat flux varies with the specific interface location within
   droplet. The total mass flux primarily depends on the TPCL length
   determined by the droplet evaporation mode. When the droplet evaporates
   by partial penetration in the Cassie state, the amount of evaporation at
   liquid-vapor interface between pillars is greater than that above
   pillars. This paper provides more details and insights for a deep
   understanding of droplet evaporation on pillar structured surfaces.},

Abstract = {In 2013 a new bulk tungsten divertor, Div-III, was installed in ASDEX
   Upgrade (AUG). During the concept and design phase of Div-III the option
   of adaptable divertor instrumentation and divertor modification as
   contribution for divertor investigations in preparation of ITER was
   given a high priority. To gain flexibility for the test of divertor
   modifications without affecting the operational space of AUG, the large
   divertor manipulator, DIM-II, was designed and installed.
   DIM-II allows to retract 2 out of 128 outer divertor target tiles
   including the water cooled support structure into a target exchange box
   and to replace these targets without breaking the vacuum of the AUG
   vessel. DIM-II is based on a carriage-rail system with a driving rod
   pushing a front-end with the target module into the divertor position
   for plasma operation.
   Three types of front-ends are foreseen for physics investigations: (i)
   modified standard targets clamped to the standard cooling structure,
   (ii) dedicated front-ends making use of the whole available volume of
   about 230 x 160 x 80 mm(3) and (iii) actively cooled/heated targets for
   cooling water temperatures up to 230 degrees C.
   This paper presents the DIM-II design including the FEM calculations for
   the modified divertor support structure and the front-end options, as
   well as the test procedure and operation mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Takeoff and climb out flap retraction is a procedure that is conducted
   following takeoff to retract the flaps and slats from a takeoff
   configuration to a clean-up-and-away configuration. During this period
   the aircraft accelerates from the takeoff V2 speed to 250 knots and
   generally includes a thrust reduction from the takeoff thrust setting to
   the climb thrust setting. Timing of the flap retraction is critical to
   avoid overspeed or underspeed. Also, due to the vicinity of terrain and
   traffic, the aircraft performance and airspace must be carefully
   monitored while staying responsive to Air Traffic Control voice
   communication. As a result the design and certification of these
   procedures must resolve multiple conflicting objectives.
   This paper describes a formal analysis of alternate takeoff flap
   retraction procedures for the BAE 146 (Avro) aircraft. One procedure
   requires a ``callout{''} by the Pilot Flying (PF) for each stage of flap
   retraction. The other procedure delegates flap retraction to the Pilot
   Monitoring (PM). A formal analysis of the procedures using the Human
   Machine Interaction Sequence Diagram (HMI-SD) method yielded equal
   utility. Overall, the Callout procedure is more robust to interruption
   and provides a better shared mental model between the crew members.
   However, the Delegate procedure can be completed on average 4.5 seconds
   faster providing more time for monitoring or performing other tasks. The
   implications and limitations of the formal procedure analysis is
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The TB-Horse II is a bio-inspired quadruped robot with biological
   features of the breed Mangalarga Marchador. The main target of this
   paper is to verify the possibility of the robot to make the transition
   to paw/hoof during its movements through the gait marcha. In this study,
   the transition is the process of retracting the end joints, which are
   the feet of robot's legs, forming something similar to a paw or hoof
   that increase the ground contact area of the robot. The swing-leg
   retraction allows the TB-Horse II to walk on soft ground or sandy
   terrain, because the normal position of the legs creates an excessive
   pressure and can sink into the sand. The transition to paw/hoof is
   carried out in three steps defined as gait marcha, gait marcha in
   transition and paw/hoof locomotion. In the first step, the TB-Horse II
   uses the gait marcha as a walking pattern. The swing-leg retraction is
   performed in the second step. In the third step, the robot moves using
   the gait marcha, but with the paw/hoof already formed. However, in this
   step, the movements of the gait marcha is changed due to the curvature
   of the paw/hoof formed and increase the contact area with the ground.
   Finally, the three steps are implemented and validated in the simulation
   software called Virtual Robot Experimentation Platform (V-REP).},

Abstract = {In most mobile robots, the ability to move from point to point in
   various types of terrain was the most crucial part to the design. Being
   able to survive through impact conditions is also essential for robots
   under hazardous circumstances such as rescue robots or military robots.
   In this paper, we designed and developed a robot with impact reduction
   mechanism which is based on the compliant design of its legs. The
   stiffness of the legs was designed to not only to serve walking purposes
   but also to help reduce the impact while dropping. An experiment was set
   to investigate how the radius of curvature of the connecting plate and
   the compliant leg of the robot play a role in impact absorption. The
   radius of curvature is one of the key factors which vary the stiffness
   of the compliant parts. With this design, the robot will gradually press
   the ground during landing using springlike legs. The compliant legs with
   nonlinear spring constant help absorb impact energy while the robot hits
   the ground. During drop-landing motion, the robot also transforms itself
   from a spherical shape into a legged robot while landing. The legs are
   extended into a walking mechanism on uneven terrain and retracted to
   create a ball shaped robot for rolling motion over smooth terrain. The
   transformation between the spherical shaped robot and the legged robot
   increase its motion capabilities under various conditions including
   falling, rolling and walking. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {An inchworm-like capsule robot (ILCR) is a promising device for a
   minimally invasive diagnosis and treatment of colon diseases. It
   consists of two expanders and one extensor, the former provides a
   traction force by expanding the colon and the latter can elongate and
   retract to enable active locomotion. However, the locomotion efficiency
   of the ILCR can be seriously lowered by the complex colon environment
   featuring slippery, viscoelastic, and suspend properties, which has been
   a main obstacle to its clinical application. This paper aims at
   improving the locomotion efficiency of the ILCR by optimizing its
   extensor design. To do this, the locomotion resistance of the ILCR in
   the colon is analyzed, and complying with a requirement that the
   traction force must be larger than the locomotion resistance to avoid
   slipping, a restriction on the extensor design is obtained. Then under
   the restriction and with reference to the Hyperelastic model which
   correlates stress and strain of colon tissue, a model for analyzing the
   influence of the design parameters of the extensor on the locomotion
   efficiency of the ILCR is built. With this model, the extensor has been
   optimized and the optimized results have been used to guide the
   development of a novel extensor, which employs two pairs of lead-screws
   and nuts and is actuated by one motor. Ex-vivo experiment has shown that
   the novel extensor can improve the locomotion efficiency of an ILCR
   prototype by 57\%, without changing its total length.},

Title = {QUANTITATIVE EXAMINATION OF A LARGE SAMPLE OF SUPRA-ARCADE DOWNFLOWS IN
   ERUPTIVE SOLAR FLARES},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {730},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Sunward-flowing voids above post-coronal mass ejection flare arcades
   were first discovered using the soft X-ray telescope aboard Yohkoh and
   have since been observed with TRACE (extreme ultraviolet (EUV)),
   SOHO/LASCO (white light), SOHO/SUMER (EUV spectra), and Hinode/XRT (soft
   X-rays). Supra-arcade downflow (SAD) observations suggest that they are
   the cross-sections of thin flux tubes retracting from a reconnection
   site high in the corona. Supra-arcade downflowing loops (SADLs) have
   also been observed under similar circumstances and are theorized to be
   SADs viewed from a perpendicular angle. Although previous studies have
   focused on dark flows because they are easier to detect and
   complementary spectral data analysis reveals their magnetic nature, the
   signal intensity of the flows actually ranges from dark to bright. This
   implies that newly reconnected coronal loops can contain a range of hot
   plasma density. Previous studies have presented detailed SAD
   observations for a small number of flares. In this paper, we present a
   substantial SADs and SADLs flare catalog. We have applied semiautomatic
   detection software to several of these events to detect and track
   individual downflows thereby providing statistically significant samples
   of parameters such as velocity, acceleration, area, magnetic flux,
   shrinkage energy, and reconnection rate. We discuss these measurements
   (particularly the unexpected result of the speeds being an order of
   magnitude slower than the assumed Alfven speed), how they were obtained,
   and potential impact on reconnection models.},

Title = {Equations in acylindrically hyperbolic groups and verbal closedness},
Journal = {GROUPS GEOMETRY AND DYNAMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Pages = {613-682},
Abstract = {Let H be an acylindrically hyperbolic group without nontrivial finite
   normal subgroups. We show that any finite system S of equations with
   constants from H is equivalent to a single equation. We also show that
   the algebraic set associated with S is, up to conjugacy, a projec-tion
   of the algebraic set associated with a single splitted equation (such an
   equation has the form w (x1, ... , xn) = h, where w 2 F (X), h 2 H).From
   this we deduce the following statement: Let G be an arbitrary overgroup
   of the above group H. Then H is verbally closed in G if and only if it
   is algebraically closed in G.These statements have interesting
   implications; here we give only two of them: If H is a non -cyclic
   torsion-free hyperbolic group, then every (possibly infinite) system of
   equations with finitely many variables and with constants from H is
   equivalent to a single equation. We give a positive solution to Problem
   5.2 from the paper {[}J. Group Theory 17 (2014), 29-40] of Myasnikov and
   Roman'kov: Verbally closed subgroups of torsion-free hyperbolic groups
   are retracts.Moreover, we describe solutions of the equation xnym = anbm
   in acylindrically hyperbolic groups (AH-groups), where a, b are
   non-commensurable jointly special loxodromic elements and n, m are
   integers with sufficiently large common divisor. We also prove the
   existence of special test words in AH-groups and give an application to
   endomorphisms of AH-groups.},

Title = {NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH AMBIENT PRESSURES ON
   SUPERCRITICAL JETS AND MIXING PROCESS},
Journal = {HEAT TRANSFER RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Number = {8},
Pages = {717-737},
Abstract = {Understanding and predicting the fuel spray characteristics under
   trans/supercritical conditions is crucial to the design of rocket and
   diesel engines. In this paper, the effects of different supercritical
   environmental pressures on the thermodynamics and flow characteristics
   of a cryogenic liquid jet are investigated numerically. In particular,
   we discuss the evolution processes and characteristics of the mixing
   layer on the liquid jet surface. To facilitate the analysis, we use
   nitrogen as a material to simulate the supercritical jet under the
   Mayer's experimental conditions by a self-built CFD model. Results
   demonstrate that, with increasing the supercritical ambient pressures,
   the pseudoboiling temperatures are increased, but the pseudoboiling
   behavior is significantly weakened, while the intensity of thermal
   diffusion increases and also the length of the cold core becomes
   shorter. However, in the downstream of the cold core, the thickness of
   the mixing layer is increased due to the reduction of the damping
   introduced by the density gradient. Also, with increasing the
   supercritical ambient pressure and weakening of the pseudoboiling
   effect, the isothermal expansion is more and more replaced by a
   continuously rising temperature process. Consequently, the jet is more
   like a gaseous jet, and enters the self-similar state fast. Furthermore,
   an entropy analysis demonstrates that a high ambient pressure promotes
   the entropy yield and accelerates the mixing between the injected fluids
   and surrounding gas, so that the mixing layer gradually retracts toward
   the nozzle.},

Title = {Continued post-retraction citation of a fraudulent clinical trial
   report, 11 years after it was retracted for falsifying data},
Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of long-term post-retraction citation
   to falsified clinical trial data (Matsuyama et al. in Chest
   128(6):3817-3827, 2005. 10.1378/chest.128.6.3817), demonstrating
   problems with how the current digital library environment communicates
   retraction status. Eleven years after its retraction, the paper
   continues to be cited positively and uncritically to support a medical
   nutrition intervention, without mention of its 2008 retraction for
   falsifying data. To date no high quality clinical trials reporting on
   the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing inflammatory markers
   have been published. Our paper uses network analysis, citation context
   analysis, and retraction status visibility analysis to illustrate the
   potential for extended propagation of misinformation over a citation
   network, updating and extending a case study of the first 6 years of
   post-retraction citation (Fulton et al. in Publications 3(1):7-26, 2015.
   10.3390/publications3010017). The current study covers 148 direct
   citations from 2006 through 2019 and their 2542 second-generation
   citations and assesses retraction status visibility of the case study
   paper and its retraction notice on 12 digital platforms as of 2020. The
   retraction is not mentioned in 96\% (107/112) of direct post-retraction
   citations for which we were able to conduct citation context analysis.
   Over 41\% (44/107) of direct post-retraction citations that do not
   mention the retraction describe the case study paper in detail, giving a
   risk of diffusing misinformation from the case paper. We analyze 152
   second-generation citations to the most recent 35 direct citations
   (2010-2019) that do not mention the retraction but do mention methods or
   results of the case paper, finding 23 possible diffusions of
   misinformation from these non-direct citations to the case paper. Link
   resolving errors from databases show a significant challenge in a reader
   reaching the retraction notice via a database search. Only 1/8 databases
   (and 1/9 database records) consistently resolved the retraction notice
   to its full-text correctly in our tests. Although limited to evaluation
   of a single case (N = 1), this work demonstrates how retracted research
   can continue to spread and how the current information environment
   contributes to this problem.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Blockchain has been expected to create a secure
   mechanism for exchanging not only for cryptocurrency but also for other
   types of assets without the need for a powerful and trusted third-party.
   This could enable a new era of the Internet usage called the Internet of
   Value (IoV) in which any types of assets such as intellectual and
   digital properties, equity and wealth can be digitized and transferred
   in an automated, secure, and convenient manner. In the IoV, Blockchain
   is used to guarantee the immutability of transactions meaning that it is
   impractical to retract once a transaction is confirmed. Therefore, to
   strengthen the IoV, before making any transactions it is crucial to
   evaluate trust between participants for reducing the risk of dealing
   with malicious peers. In this article, we clarify the concept of IoV and
   propose a trust-based IoV model including a system architecture,
   components and features. Then, we present a trust platform in the IoV
   considering two concepts, Experience and Reputation, originated from
   Social Networks for evaluating trust between two any peers in the IoV.
   The Experience and Reputation are characterized and calculated using
   mathematical models with analysis and simulation in the IoV environment.
   We believe this paper consolidates the understandings about IoV
   technologies and demonstrates how trust is evaluated and used to
   strengthen the IoV. It also opens important research directions on both
   IoV and trust in the future.},

   was focused onto the MCA over the intact skull. Upon laser irradiation,
   intravenous administration of a rose bengal solution was begun. After 4
   min of irradiation, the laser beam was refocused on the MCA just
   proximal to the first spot, and another 4-min irradiation was performed.
   Then, the right common carotid artery (CCA) was ligated. Three days
   later, the brain was removed, and infarct volume was determined.
   Infarction confined almost solely to the cortical area was produced in
   each mouse. Mean infarct volume in C57BL/6 mice was 25.2 +/- 13.7 mm(3).
   The BALB mice group showed significantly larger and more reproducible
   infarction (44.1 +/- 5.2 mm(3); the coefficient of variation was 12\%)
   than did C57BL/6 mice (P<0.005).
   Our photothrombosis model of stroke in mice can be performed without
   craniectomy, and its reproducibility is satisfactory when using BALB
   mice. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Vulnerability of Drop Ceilings in Roadway Tunnels to Fire-Induced Damage},

Abstract = {Roadway tunnels often include a reinforced concrete drop ceiling that is
   hung from the liner to create a plenum that facilitates ventilation and
   houses utilities. Drop ceiling panels are lightweight compared with the
   much thicker tunnel liner and can experience significant damage from a
   fire on the roadway below. This paper examines the flexural response of
   drop ceiling panels in two representative tunnels to standard fire
   curves as well as several realistic fires due to vehicular accidents.
   Standard fire demands as per the Rijkswaterstaat and ASTM E1529 fire
   curves are uniformly applied to the ceiling panels, and heat exposure
   contours for typical vehicle fires with heat release rates of 30, 100,
   and 200 MW are generated from the software CFAST. The finite element
   analysis software SAFIR is used to evaluate the thermo-mechanical
   behavior of the ceiling panels when subjected to various thermal demands
   from the fire below. The analysis results indicate that drop ceiling
   panels are highly vulnerable to fire-induced damage and potential
   collapse both during a fire's active heating phase (from simultaneous
   loss of capacity and restraint of thermal expansion) and during the
   subsequent cooling period (from tension that develops when the
   permanently deformed panel thermally retracts). The potential for
   fire-induced damage or collapse of the drop ceiling panels can be
   mitigated by reducing the fire hazard, removing the drop ceiling, or
   enhancing the fire resistance of the panels via the application of
   passive protection or structural hardening.},

Abstract = {In this paper we initiate the study of discrete random variables over
   domains. Our work is inspired by that of Daniele Varacca, who devised
   indexed valuations as models of probabilistic computation within domain
   theory. Our approach relies on new results about commutative monoids
   defined on domains that also allow actions of the non-negative reals.
   Using our approach, we define two such families of real domain monoids,
   one of which allows us to recapture Varacca's construction of the
   Plotkin indexed valuations over a domain. Each of these families leads
   to the construction of a family of discrete random variables over
   domains, the second of which forms the object level of a continuous
   endofunctor on the categories RB (domains that are retracts of bifinite
   domains). and on FS (domains where the identity map is the directed
   supremum of deflations finitely separated from the identity). The
   significance of this last result lies in the fact that there is no known
   category of continuous domains that is closed under the probabilistic
   power domain, which forms the standard approach to modelling
   probabilistic choice over domains. The fact that RB and FS are Cartesian
   closed and also are closed under a power domain of discrete random
   variables means we can now model, e.g. the untyped lambda calculus
   extended with a probabilistic choice operator, implemented via random
   variables. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Emotional language processing in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {In his first description of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Kanner
   emphasized emotional impairments by characterizing children with ASD as
   indifferent to other people, self-absorbed, emotionally cold, distanced,
   and retracted. Thereafter, emotional impairments became regarded as part
   of the social impairments of ASD, and research mostly focused on
   understanding how individuals with ASD recognize visual expressions of
   emotions from faces and body postures. However, it still remains unclear
   how emotions are processed outside of the visual domain. This systematic
   review aims to fill this gap by focusing on impairments of emotional
   language processing in ASD. We systematically searched PubMed for papers
   published between 1990 and 2013 using standardized search terms. Studies
   show that people with ASD are able to correctly classify emotional
   language stimuli as emotionally positive or negative. However,
   processing of emotional language stimuli in ASD is associated with
   atypical patterns of attention and memory performance, as well as
   abnormal physiological and neural activity. Particularly, younger
   children with ASD have difficulties in acquiring and developing
   emotional concepts, and avoid using these in discourse. These emotional
   language impairments were not consistently associated with age, IQ, or
   level of development of language skills. We discuss how emotional
   language impairments fit with existing cognitive theories of ASD, such
   as central coherence, executive dysfunction, and weak Theory of Mind. We
   conclude that emotional impairments in ASD may be broader than just a
   mere consequence of social impairments, and should receive more
   attention in future research.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the experimental characterization of droplet
   formation in accordance with different types of driving waveform. The
   objective of the experiments is to generate sound droplets with a
   minimal volume depending on the types of driving waveform. For it, two
   types of driving waveform are used to investigate the droplet formation
   of the M-Jet: one is bipolar and another W-shaped. In the case of the
   bipolar waveform, t(i) lead to fluid flows from the liquid reservoir
   into the chamber in the M-Jet and t(h) is time to impose a pulse under
   the constant magnetic field, resulting in the formation of the droplets.
   The droplet volume decreases as t(i) increases, and increases with
   further increase of t(i). The threshold t(i) is equal to 500 mu s. The
   droplet volume decreases as t(h) decreases, but the droplet formation
   was not successful at less than 550 mu s. In the case of the W-shaped
   waveform, maintains t(i) and t(h) where is set from bipolar waveform,
   control the t(r) where retracted MM keeps to control droplet volume. The
   tail becomes longer as t(r) increases. The droplet volume remains nearly
   constant as t(r) increases, but rapidly increases with further increase
   of t(r). When the two driving waveform, the W-shaped driving waveform
   seems to be effective in reducing the droplet volume, and achieves the
   reduction of volume by 30 percent.},

Title = {Gradual or abrupt? The phonetic path to morphologisation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHONETICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {76-91},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While some sound changes occur in environments defined in purely
   phonological terms, others may become sensitive to morphological
   boundaries. In this paper, we investigate the phonetic nature of this
   latter diachronic development: does it happen through small gradient
   increments, or is there a categorical shift from one allophone to
   another? We focus on Goose-fronting and /I/-darkening in Southern
   British English, the interaction of which is sensitive to morphological
   boundaries. Relatively retracted realisations of the vowel and dark
   realisations of the Ill appear before a morpheme boundary, even when a
   vowel follows (e.g. fool-ing), whereas in monomorphemic words (e.g.
   hula), there is more /u:/-fronting, and the /I/ is relatively lighter.
   We analyse the phonetic realisation of such pairs as hula vs. fooling in
   20 speakers of Southern British English using both acoustic and
   articulatory (ultrasound) instrumental methods. All the speakers express
   the morphological contrast in some way, although effect sizes vary
   dramatically. For some speakers, the contrast involves subtle
   articulatory differences without any clear acoustic consequences,
   whereas other speakers show robust differences employing multiple
   phonetic correlates. We therefore argue that the hula similar to
   fool-ing contrast would be misrepresented if analysed in terms of a
   small number of either /u:/ or /I/ allophonic categories. Instead, we
   interpret the results as supporting the predictions of phonological
   frameworks that incorporate phonetically-gradient morphologisation. (C)

Title = {Shape Memory Alloy Based Morphing Aerostructures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {132},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In order to continue the current rate of improvements in aircraft
   performance, aircraft and components which are continuously optimized
   for all flight conditions, will be needed. Toward this goal
   morphing-capable, adaptive structures based on shape memory alloy (SMA)
   technology that enable component and system-level optimization at
   multiple flight conditions are being developed. This paper reviews five
   large-scale SMA based technology programs initiated by The Boeing
   Company. The SAMPSON smart inlet program showed that fully integrated
   SMA wire bundles could provide a fighter aircraft with a variable engine
   inlet capability. The reconfigurable rotor blade program demonstrated
   the ability of highly robust, controlled 55-Nitinol tube actuators to
   twist a rotor blade in a spin stand test to optimize rotor aerodynamic
   characteristics. The variable geometry chevron (VGC) program, which was
   the first use of 60-Nitinol for a major aerospace application, included
   a flight test and static engine test of the GE90-115B engine fitted with
   controlled morphing chevrons that reduced noise and increased engine
   efficiency. The deployable rotor tab employed tube actuators to deploy
   and retract small fences capable of significantly reducing blade-vortex
   interaction generated noise on a rotor-craft. Most recently, the
   variable geometry fan nozzle program has built on the VGC technology to
   demonstrate improved jet engine performance. Continued maturation of SMA
   technology is needed in order to develop innovative applications and
   support their commercialization. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4001119]},

Title = {Psychometric properties of the job anxiety scale},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {BackgroundOccupational stress and specifically job anxiety are crucial
   factors in determining health outcomes, job satisfaction as well as
   performance. In order to assess this phenomenon, the Job Anxiety Scale
   (JAS) is one of the instruments available. It consists of 70 items that
   are clustered in 14 subscales and five dimensions. This manuscript is a
   revised version of a retracted article that analyzed the properties of a
   short version of the JAS. Rather than shortening the scale, the authors
   of the JAS recommend to further assess the scale in its current state
   without modification of the factor structure. Hence, the aim of this
   paper is to assess the psychometric properties of the original JAS.
   MethodsThe sample consists of 991 - mostly psychosomatic - patients from
   two different clinics. We applied methods of factor analysis and
   bivariate correlations to explore and test factor structure and the
   nomological net of related constructs. ResultsThe Job Anxiety Scale
   evinced satisfactory psychometric properties. We found very high
   internal consistency, and invariance across participant age. It
   displayed good discriminant validity and we found the expected pattern
   of convergent correlations. However, the model fit is not convincing.
   ConclusionWith the Job Anxiety Scale, researchers can assess job related
   worries in a reliable manner. The questionnaire is particularly useful
   in large-scale surveys, in therapy or work-related contexts. However,
   the scale could be modified in order to aim for a better fit and assess
   job related anxiety in a more efficient way.},

   Lioy, 1864 (Diptera: Agromyzidae) mining in or near the cambium of trees
   and shrubs (Cui et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2016). The genus now includes 18
   described species (12 Palaearctic species and six Nearctic species)
   (Chen and Zheng 2020), characterized by the following (Cui et al. 2015;
   Chen and Zheng 2020): vein r-m of fore wing absent; mandible exodont,
   with 3 teeth and sometime additional 1-2 small lobes, second tooth
   usually acute; epistomal suture deep and as wide as convex part of
   clypeus (subgenus Trachionus Haliday) or quite narrow (subgenus
   Planiricus Perepechayenko); ocelli strongly protruding (subgenus
   Trachionus) or normal (subgenus Planiricus); metanotum distinctly and
   acutely protruding dorsally; second and third metasomal tergites at
   least partly sculptured, fourth and fifth tergites smooth; for female,
   combined length of second and third tergites 0.6-0.8x total length of
   metasoma and tergites beyond the third more or less retracted. The type
   of Trachionus polongongius sp. nov. is deposited in the Institute of

Abstract = {Gravitational Wave (GW) events are physical processes that significantly
   perturbate space-time, e.g. compact binary coalescenses, causing the
   production of GWs. The detection of GWs by a worldwide network of
   advanced interferometers offers unique opportunities for multi-messenger
   searches and electromagnetic counterpart associations. While carrying
   extremely useful information, searches for associated electromagnetic
   emission are challenging due to large sky localisation uncertainties
   provided by the current GW observatories LIGO and Virgo. Here we present
   the methods and procedures used within the High Energy Stereoscopic
   System (H.E.S.S.) in searches for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray
   emission associated to the emission of GWs from extreme events. To do so
   we create several algorithms dedicated to schedule GW follow-up
   observations by creating optimized pointing paterns. We describe
   algorithms using 2-dimensional GW localisation information and
   algorithms correlating the galaxy distribution in the local universe, by
   using galaxy catalogs, with the 3-dimensional GW localisation
   information and evaluate their performances. The H.E.S.S. automatic GW
   follow-up chain, described in this paper, is optimized to initiate GW
   follow-up observations within less than 1 minute after the alert
   reception. These developements allowed H.E.S.S. observations of 6 GW
   events out of the 67 non-retracted GW events detected during the first
   three observation runs of LIGO and Virgo reaching VHE gamma-ray
   coverages of up to 70\% of the GW localisation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, according to problems of large deformation, high stress
   and strong disturbance exist in the retracement roadway during the
   equipment withdrawal of 18,205 large height mining working face in
   Xiegou mine. The method of roof cutting and pressure release by
   deep-hole blasting is put forward. Based on the analysis of the
   characteristics of different roof cutting depth on the stress and
   deformation of surrounding rock of the retracement roadway by using
   Phase numerical simulation software, the optimum roof cutting depth
   suitable for safe retracting of working face is obtained. The support
   scheme of retracement roadway of the working face and its cross area
   with the mining gateway is put forward and realize the safely equipment
   retreat of the working face. The research results show that the stress
   of surrounding rock and the development depth of plastic zone as well as
   the displacement of roof, floor and left side of the retracement roadway
   are effectively reduced after roof cutting, and the larger of the roof
   cutting depth, the more obvious the pressure release effect will be. The
   optimal roof cutting position of the working face is calculated and the
   monitoring results of mine pressure show that the deformation of the
   retracement roadway and the cross area of the roadway after cutting off
   the roof and unloading is small, and the support scheme could
   effectively control the destruction of the surrounding rock of the
   retracement roadway.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present algorithms and experiments for multi-scale
   assembly of complex structures by multi-robot teams. We also focus on
   tasks where successful completion requires multiple types of assembly
   operations with a range of precision requirements. We develop a
   hierarchical planning approach to multi-scale perception in support of
   multi-scale manipulation, in which the resolution of the perception
   operation is matched with the required resolution for the manipulation
   operation. We demonstrate these techniques in the context of a
   multi-step task where robots assemble large box-like objects, inspired
   by the assembly of an airplane wing. The robots begin by transporting a
   wing panel, a coarse manipulation operation that requires a wide field
   of view, and gradually shifts to a narrower field of view but with more
   accurate sensors for part alignment and fastener insertion. Within this
   framework we also provide for failure detection and recovery: upon
   losing track of a feature, the robots retract to using wider field of
   view systems to re-localize. Finally, we contribute collaborative
   manipulation algorithms for assembling complex large objects. First, the
   team of robots coordinates to transport large assembly parts which are
   too heavy for a single robot to carry. Second, the fasteners and parts
   are co-localized for robust insertion and fastening. We implement these
   ideas using four KUKA youBot robots and present experiments where our
   robots successfully complete all 80 of the attempted fastener insertion
   operations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology to measure the pull-off force of
   rigid bodies by recording force curves with an atomic force microscope
   (AFM). With the presented method, structured or modified surfaces can be
   inspected under close to target device conditions. Furthermore, large
   sample arrays can be inspected using the AFM as a sensing element. The
   inspected structures in this study are rigid silicon discs with a
   diameter of 200 mu m, supported by soft silicon oxide springs. The discs
   are pushed down by the AFM tip on a bottom substrate. When retracting
   the AFM tip and the disc, a discontinuity in the force curve of the AFM
   occurs due to the pull-off. The surface interaction of silicon oxide
   surfaces provided with hemispherical tips and flat silicon surfaces is
   determined. Therefore, various surface configurations are inspected,
   with varying tip radii and varying number of tips. The lowest adhesion
   force measured for a single device is 240 nN. In terms of total work of
   adhesion per area this value equals 9 x 10(-7) mJ m(-2). The measured
   adhesion is compared to calculated data based on a Van der Waals surface
   interaction model. The method features a relative error of 0.26 which is
   comparable to the corresponding value of cantilever beam detachment
   (CBD) measurements from the literature. The resolution of the presented
   method is only limited by the force resolution of the AFM which in this
   work is 20 nN.},

Abstract = {The U.S. solar-array strings on the International Space Station are
   connected to a sequential shunt unit. The sequential shunt unit's job is
   to shunt excess current from the solar array, such that just enough
   current is provided downstream to maintain the bus voltage while meeting
   the power load demand. Should a unit fail, its removal and replacement
   would normally be done with the solar arrays retracted to reduce the
   voltages and currents at the sequential shunt unit to safe levels.
   However, an alternate approach was desired to avoid the inherent risks
   associated with array retraction and redeployment. This approach allowed
   the replacement to be conducted via astronaut ``space walk{''} or extra
   vehicular activity with the solar array still deployed. Removing a
   sequential shunt unit with the solar array in sunlight could result in
   substantial hardware damage and/or safety risk to the astronaut due to
   the voltages that may be present. Replacing the sequential shunt unit
   during eclipse would seem optimal, except that the maximum eclipse
   period is only 36 min, which is insufficient time. To guide the
   assessment and ameliorate hazards, the athours analyzed array string
   current and voltage capability during the various operating conditions
   using System Power Analysis for Capability Evaluation (SPACE), an
   electrical power system modeling code. This paper discusses six
   sequential shunt unit remove and replacement options and the associated
   analysis to develop a workable sequential shunt unit replacement
   procedure via extravehicular activity.},

   robot motions in configuration spaces of small and large
   dimensionalities. However, their efficiency decreases dramatically in
   spaces with narrow passages. This paper presents a new method-small-step
   retraction-that helps PRM planners find paths through such passages.
   This method consists of slightly ``fattening{''} robot's free space,
   constructing a roadmap in fattened free space, and finally repairing
   portions of this roadmap by retracting them out of collision into actual
   free space. Fattened free space is not explicitly computed. Instead, the
   geometric models of workspace objects (robot links and/or obstacles) are
   ``thinned{''} around their medial axis. A robot configuration lies in
   fattened free space if the thinned objects do not collide at this
   configuration. Two repair strategies are proposed. The ``optimist{''}
   strategy waits until a complete path has been found in fattened free
   space before repairing it. Instead, the ``pessimist{''} strategy repairs
   the roadmap as it is being built. The former is usually very fast, but
   may fail in some pathological cases. The latter is more reliable, but
   not as fast. A simple combination of the two strategies yields an
   integrated planner that is both fast and reliable. This planner was
   implemented as an extension of a pre-existing single-query PRM planner.
   Comparative tests show that it is significantly faster (sometimes by
   several orders of magnitude) than the pre-existing planner.},

Title = {Benchmarking Scientific Image Forgery Detectors},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The field of scientific image integrity presents a challenging research
   bottleneck given the lack of available datasets to design and evaluate
   forensic techniques. The sensitivity of data also creates a legal hurdle
   that restricts the use of real-world cases to build any accessible
   forensic benchmark. In light of this, there is no comprehensive
   understanding on the limitations and capabilities of automatic image
   analysis tools for scientific images, which might create a false sense
   of data integrity. To mitigate this issue, we present an extendable
   open-source algorithm library that reproduces the most common image
   forgery operations reported by the research integrity community:
   duplication, retouching, and cleaning. We create a large scientific
   forgery image benchmark (39,423 images) with enriched ground truth using
   this library and realistic scientific images. All figures within the
   benchmark are synthetically doctored using images collected from
   creative commons sources. While collecting the source images, we ensured
   that the they did not present any suspicious integrity problems. Because
   of the high number of retracted papers due to image duplication, this
   work evaluates the state-of-the-art copy-move detection methods in the
   proposed dataset, using a new metric that asserts consistent match
   detection between the source and the copied region. All evaluated
   methods had a low performance in this dataset, indicating that
   scientific images might need a specialized copy-move detector. The
   dataset and source code are available at
   https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil.},

Title = {Networked Social Enterprises: A New Model of Community Schooling for
   Disadvantaged Neighborhoods Facing Challenging Times},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Community schools have long been accepted as an institutional mechanism
   for intervening in the relationship between poverty, poor educational
   outcomes, and limited life chances. At a time when public services are
   being retracted, and disadvantaged places are being increasingly left to
   struggle, community schools are poised to become more important in
   offering a response to the needs of children, families, and communities
   in these places. Yet, despite their apparent promise, community schools
   remain badly under-conceptualized. As an international field, research
   on community schooling has rarely articulated or questioned how-by
   providing additional learning and leisure opportunities and personal and
   social supports-community schools might create a viable intervention in
   the relationship between poverty and poor outcomes. This paper
   explicitly addresses this significant challenge. Conceptualizing
   empirical findings emerging from a research-practice partnership, it
   identifies the core features of a new institutional design for community
   schools which can help to clarify their potential contribution to
   addressing disadvantage. Marking a considerable shift from a traditional
   design of simply adding new services to the school day, it argues that
   community schools will need to operate as social enterprises with
   networked governance arrangements, and to develop strategies which
   engage with children's social ecologies, and are risk-reducing and
   resilience-building within these. This, in turn, sets a new agenda for
   significantly advancing the field of community schooling by further
   defining-conceptually and empirically-the core elements of a new
   institutional design as identified here.},

Title = {Pure endoscopic removal of epidermoid tumors of the cerebellopontine

Volume = {30},

Pages = {1261-1267},

Abstract = {Epidermoid tumors located in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) are
   challenging lesions because they tend to grow slowly in the subarachnoid
   cisterns around delicate neurovascular structures and often extend into
   surgical anatomic corners. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the
   advantages and limitations of purely endoscopic removal of the CPA
   epidermoids.
   Six patients harboring an epidermoid tumor located in the CPA were
   treated using an endoscope-controlled microsurgical technique. A
   retrosigmoid suboccipital approach was used in all patients. The
   cerebellomedullary cistern and the cisterna magna were opened to allow
   cerebrospinal fluid drainage and cerebellar drop, thus yielding a wide
   and straight working channel to the CPA. Then, the tumor and its capsule
   were removed by the modified microsurgical instruments.
   The symptoms caused by mass effect of the lesion resolved after surgery.
   There were no deaths, but permanent deficits occurred in one patient
   whose cranial nerves VII/VIII complex was accidentally lesioned. Tumors
   and their capsules were totally removed in five cases. All patients were
   discharged 3-5 days after surgery. To date, no recurrences have been
   observed (follow-up range 14-50 months).
   The endoscope-controlled microsurgical technique enables a safe tumor
   removal even when parts of the lesion are not visible in a straight line
   in CPA epidermoids. By angled endoscopic lenses, tumor extending into
   adjacent cranial compartments or surgical anatomic corners can be
   removed through a single small craniotomy without retracting
   neurovascular structures.},

Title = {A spiral-based inspection path generation algorithm for efficient
   five-axis sweep scanning of freeform surfaces},
Journal = {COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {124},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Traditional inspection of freeform surfaces via three-axis or three +
   two-axis CMM mainly works in a point-by-point manner where for each
   inspection point, the stylus of CMM has to approach to and then retract
   from the surface of inspection, which inevitably drags down (often
   substantially) the inspection efficiency. Recently, a new inspection
   apparatus called five-axis inspection machine has emerged, on which the
   stylus tip can continuously sweep on the part surface and the inspection
   efficiency can thus be tremendously improved. The crux in using this new
   inspection technology is how to plan an efficient five-axis inspection
   path (including both the position and orientation of the stylus). In
   this paper, we present a new type of five-axis inspection path
   generation strategy for the inspection of a general freeform surface.
   Based on the proposed index called Surface Sweep Rate (SSR), an
   algorithm is designed to partition the surface into a single spiral
   strip, which maximizes the overall SSR. Then, for this single spiral
   strip, a five-axis inspection path is generated that takes into
   consideration the key constraints such as the required smoothness of the
   probe head trajectory, the sampling density, and the collision-free
   condition. Physical inspection experiments of our proposed strategy are
   conducted on two typical freeform surfaces, and the results convincingly
   confirm the feasibility, effectiveness, and advantages of our new
   solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigate the security properties of the three deterministic random
   bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms in NIST SP 800-90A {[}2]. The standard
   received considerable negative attention due to the controversy
   surrounding the now retracted DualEC-DRBG, which appeared in earlier
   versions. Perhaps because of the attention paid to the DualEC, the other
   algorithms in the standard have received surprisingly patchy analysis to
   date, despite widespread deployment. This paper addresses a number of
   these gaps in analysis, with a particular focus on HASH-DRBG and
   HMAC-DRBG. We uncover a mix of positive and less positive results. On
   the positive side, we prove (with a caveat) the robustness {[}13] of
   HASH-DRBG and HMAC-DRBG in the random oracle model (ROM). Regarding the
   caveat, we show that if an optional input is omitted, then contrary to
   claims in the standard HMAC-DRBG does not even achieve the (weaker)
   property of forward security. We then conduct a more informal and
   practice-oriented exploration of flexibility in the standard.
   Specifically, we argue that these DRBGs have the property that partial
   state leakage may lead security to break down in unexpected ways. We
   highlight implementation choices allowed by the overly flexible standard
   that exacerbate both the likelihood, and impact, of such attacks. While
   our attacks are theoretical, an analysis of two open source
   implementations of CTR-DRBG shows that these potentially problematic
   implementation choices are made in the real world.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Embryology is the biological science that studies the
   prenatal development of organisms. Interest is to clarify the gross
   anatomy and explain how they develop normal and abnormal structures,
   such as congenital malformations.
   Purpose: This paper describes the macroscopic and radiographic
   morphology found in malformed fetuses.
   Materials and methods in the laboratory of experimental embryology
   malformed fetuses were studied footage being photographed with Kodak
   film radiographic D speed, size 3x4 cm Kodak D-speed film, size 6x8 cm.
   The radiation generating device used was 70 kV and 8 mA, with an
   exposure time of 0.25 seconds at an object-focus distance of 40cm, fixed
   anode tube. The radiogenic fluids used to process Kodak film by the
   method visual.
   Results: Based on macroscopic observation were identified in a fetal
   omphalocele, acraneo, rachischisis almost complete bony bump on the
   neck, absence of parietal, occipital and lumbar vertebral arches. Eyes
   retracted. Was found radiographically normal process of calcification of
   upper and lower limbs. Vertebrae, ribs and skull with delayed
   calcification, with the abnormal-looking skull. In another macroscopic
   observation revealed fetal anencephaly and spina bifida, rachischisis.
   Radiographically, no signs of calcification.
   Conclusions: Macroscopic identification allowed to classify the type of
   malformations and radiographic imaging features of ossification found
   altered in fetuses. Knowledge about normal development and causes of
   congenital malformations is necessary to incorporate preventive measures
   that allow the embryo and fetus to achieve normal development.},

   be surprisingly effective. In general, this is attributed to collateral
   ventilation which takes place between obstructed and adjacent,
   non-obstructed air spaces. In this paper we investigate the contribution
   of collateral ventilation to the distribution of gases in the lung and
   to the slopes of the alveolar plateaus (S) of the expirograms of He and
   SF6. To that end, we have simulated single-breath washout experiments
   with a mathematical lung model in which a fraction of the total acinar
   space was obstructed. The obstructed part was collaterally ventilated
   via the non-obstructed part by convection where both parts distended and
   retracted isotropically during the breathing maneuver. Collateral
   diffusion was assumed to be negligible during inspiration and
   expiration, but was taken into account for periods of post-inspiratory
   apnea (tA). With 20\% of the total acinar space obstructed and tA = 0
   sec, S(He) = 3.3\% . L-1 and S(SF6) = 4.7\% . L-1. For both gases S
   increased with increasing degree of airway obstruction, and decreased
   with increasing tA and with increasing degree of collateral diffusion.
   For all simulated maneuvers the alveolar plateau was rectilinearly
   shaped. We conclude that in case of airway obstructions collateral
   ventilation may substantially contribute to the slope of the alveolar
   plateaus of the expirograms of He and SF6.},

Abstract = {A morphism of a category which is simultaneously an epimorphism and a
   monomorphism is called a bimorphism. In (Dydak and Ruiz del Portal
   (Monomorphisms and epimorphisms in pro-categories, preprint)) we gave
   characterizations of monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) in arbitrary
   pro-categories, pro-C, where C has direct sums (resp. weak push-outs).
   In this paper, we introduce the notions of strong monomorphism and
   strong epimorphism. Part of their significance is that they are
   preserved by functors. These notions and their characterizations lead us
   to important classical properties and problems in shape and
   pro-homotopy. For instance, strong epimorphisms allow us to give a
   categorical point of view of uniform movability and to introduce a new
   kind of movability, the sequential movability. Strong monomorphisms are
   connected to a problem of K. Borsuk regarding a descending chain of
   retracts of ANRs. If f : X --> Y is a bimorphism in the pointed shape
   category of topological spaces, we prove that f is a weak isomorphism
   and f is an isomorphism provided Y is sequentially movable and X or Y is
   the suspension of a topological space. If f :X --> Y is a bimorphism in
   the pro-category pro-H-0 (consisting of inverse systems in H-0, the
   homotopy category of pointed connected CW complexes) we show that f is
   an isomorphism provided Y is sequentially movable. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Title = {Uses of guilt in the treatment of dehumanization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOANALYSIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {98},

Abstract = {It is likely that under the impact of impending Nazism, aggression
   theory in late Freud, as presented in Civilization and its Discontents
   (1930), left the entirety of guilt to self-punishment, thus retracting
   his view that love functions in the superego as remorse and restitution.
   This change however, essentially withdraws provision for treating
   victims of abuse, violence and terror. This paper proposes a paradigm
   shift that reframes Freud's late instinct theory into a theory of
   dehumanization by recovering reparative and relational components of
   guilt. This reframe has major implications for the position taken with
   regard to the role of witnessing and the moral imperative in recovery
   from dehumanizing experience, which orthodox psychoanalytic theory has
   essentially bypassed. It is propose that victim treatment, as case
   examples illustrate, reformulates guilt as drawing on the life instincts
   to revivify victims' humanity through analytic witnessing and
   acknowledgment. Indeed, unless breaches of humanity are confronted by a
   witness, the life instincts stay merely rhetorical, if not
   contradictory, by leaving the death instincts to grow unseen and, thus,
   unopposed. A two-fold formulation of guilt may better address and
   redress disorders of dehumanization, whereby death guilt' (under the
   sway of aggression) signifies the orthodox, irrevocable guilt of
   self-reproach for the bad we may have done, and life guilt' (under the
   sway of a moral imperative) the redeemable guilt for the good we have
   still to do.},

   microscopy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {20},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {An electrostatic force microscope (EFM) was used to characterize
   single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based nanoswitches in this paper. A
   conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip acted as a mechanical probe
   as well as a positioning electrode in the experiment. The resonance
   frequency of the SWNT beams was computed from the measured SWNTs'
   dimension and spring constant. The pull-in voltages and the
   corresponding gaps were extracted simultaneously from a set of force
   curves at different EFM probe bias voltages. The adhesive force between
   the AFM tip and the SWNT beam was measured through the analysis of
   retract force curves. The relationship between the pull-in voltage and
   the SWNT nanoswitch gap was in agreement with the electrostatic pull-in
   theory. Long-range forces such as meniscus force or electrostatic force
   from surface charges engaged the SWNT beam when the gap was below 6 nm
   in atmosphere. The SWNT beam with a resonance frequency of 1.1 GHz was
   actuated by a voltage of 2 V for a gap of 6.5 nm. The average adhesive
   force between an SWNT beam and a platinum/iridium (PtIr5)-coated tip was
   found to be about 50 nN. Considering the stiffness of the 1.1 GHz SWNT
   beam, the elastic restoring force at 6.5 nm exceeds 53 nN, which will
   overcome the adhesive force and release the 1.1 GHz SWNT beam. Finally,
   some possible approaches to further improve the behavior of SWNT
   nanoswitches are discussed.},

Abstract = {A new method is demonstrated for the simultaneous determination of both
   the liquid phase: relative permeability and the gas phase relative
   permeability as a function of compression in thin porous materials such
   as those used as gas diffusion layers (GDLs) in proton exchange membrane
   fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this method, multiple layers of the material of
   interest are inserted into the test section and the desired compression
   is achieved via pneumatic cylinders. The compression of the sample is
   maintained while both liquid and gas are forced through the medium at a
   known rate until a steady pressure differential across the compressed
   medium is achieved. Upon achieving a steady pressure differential, the
   pneumatic cylinders are retracted and the center layer of the sample
   material is released and suspended from an analytical balance. The mass
   measurement yields the liquid saturation of the material, while the flow
   rate of each component and the common pressure drop arc used to
   determine the relative permeability of each phase. The process is
   repeated at different flow rates until the dependence of the relative
   permeability on saturation is established.
   The relative permeability of liquid water in GDL materials has long been
   assumed to follow a cubic relationship with saturation similar to what
   has been observed in packed sand. However, it is shown in this work for
   a variety of macroporous GDL materials including both carbon fiber paper
   and carbon fiber cloth, that the relative permeability function is
   actually a linear function of liquid water saturation. The slope of the
   linear function is highly dependent on the substrate type, the level of
   wetproofing that has been applied to the substrate, and the compression
   of the material. Results are presented for carbon paper and carbon cloth
   materials that are untreated (no wetproofing) and that have been treated
   with a wetproofing agent to a level of 20 wt\%.},

Title = {The impact of reversibility on the decision to disclose personal
   information},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {428-436},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to examine how reversibility in disclosing
   personal information - that is, having (vs not having) to option to
   later revise or retract personal information - can impact consumers'
   willingness to divulge personal information.
   Design/methodology/approach - Three studies examined how informing
   consumers they may (reversible condition) or may not (irreversible
   condition) revise their personal information in the future affected
   their propensity to disclose personal information, compared to a control
   condition.
   Findings - Study 1 (which included three experiments with different time
   intervals between initial and revised disclosure) showed that consumers
   disclose less in both the reversible and irreversible conditions,
   compared to the control condition. Studies 2 and 3 showed that this is
   because consumers treat reversibility as a cue to the sensitivity of the
   information they are asked to divulge, and that leads them to disclose
   less when reversibility or irreversibility is made explicitly salient
   beforehand.
   Practical implications - As many marketers are interested in hoarding
   consumers' personal information, privacy advocates call for methods that
   would ensure careful and well-informed disclosure. Offering
   reversibility to a decision to disclose personal information, or merely
   pointing out the irreversibility of that decision, can make consumers
   reevaluate the sensitivity of the situation, leading to more careful
   disclosures.
   Originality/value - Although previous research on reversibility in
   consumer behavior focused on product return policies and showed that
   reversibility increases purchases, none have studied how reversibility
   affects self-disclosure and how it can decrease it.},

Title = {The elastodynamics of embryonic epidermal wound closure},
Journal = {STUDIES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {118},
Number = {4},
Pages = {365-395},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the elastodynamics of embryonic epidermal
   wound closing. Underlying the recovery process for this type of wounds
   is a mechanism of wound recognition through directed cell-to-cell
   signaling. The observed actin filament realignment induced by the
   biological signals leads to a purse-string effect and the resulting
   (unknown) ``active stresses.{''} The circumferential contraction of the
   epidermis surrounding the wound is then determined by the laws of
   mechanics and propagation properties of the relevant cell-cell signaling
   that decays with distance. With the wound known to retract for a short
   period immediately after infliction, the quasi-equilibrium configuration
   reached during this initial phase serves as the initial condition for
   the dynamic wound closing phase. A small strain variation of the
   Murray-Sherratt model of the quasi-equilibrium problem will be
   formulated for speedy computation of this initial state at the inception
   of the wound closure phase, with the latter problem being the main
   concern of this paper. Some theoretical developments are found to be
   instrumental to an efficient algorithm for the otherwise time-consuming
   task of calculating the effect of the biological signals generated by
   the presence of a wound. Application of our elastodynamic model to the
   case of a circular wound suggests that the propagation range of our
   choice of cell-cell signaling mechanism must be above a certain minimum
   fraction of the wound radius for wound closure. As expected, stress
   concentration occurs adjacent to the edge of the remaining small wound
   near the end of the wound closing process. At that point, the present
   model is not expected to be adequate and more appropriate expressions of
   elastic strain and active stress induced by actin filaments may be in
   order. Other biological processes such as cell proliferation and
   differentiation may be involved.},

Abstract = {Through the use of Hot-Spot analysis, typically reserved for local
   analysis of crime and law enforcement, I document the dispersal and
   clustering of migrant mortalities on a temporal scale in the Ajo valley
   of Southern Arizona in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. The study maps the
   influence of border enforcement by time and documents the forming of a
   state of exception, by finding whether and where migrants had taken
   other more-remote routes in relation to the constructing of and policing
   by a Border Patrol checkpoint, The spatiotemporal nature of `Hot' and
   `Cold-Spots' plus an analysis of migrant mortality locations before and
   after the establishment of a checkpoint serves as a novel approach to
   spatial analysis in border studies. It creates a type of remote
   forensics for verifying the `funnel effect' and the condition of Bare
   Life it produces where law has taken migrant's political power and left
   them with their biological existence (Agamben in Homo sacer: sovereign
   power and bare life. Stanford University Press, Stanford,1998). I show a
   widening of the state and a receding of the migrant into a rugged and
   remote isolation. Until now, the defining of the borderlands as a State
   of Exception (Doty in Int Political Sociol 1(2):113-137,2007) has been
   theoretical and qualitative. This paper doesn't retract from that but
   rather adds quantitative data and interpretation to theory, making it a
   needed clarification of biopolitics in a time of growing use of
   militarization at the U.S.-Mexico border and worldwide.},

   mechanisms of formed lines with high-viscosity silver paste and small
   gap was performed in this paper. There were three different transfer
   states under different laser fluences: non-transferred lines or
   transferred but no continuous lines, continuous transferred lines, and
   explosive transferred lines. There was a critical transfer threshold for
   the continuous line transfer under different processing speeds. Higher
   processing speed required a larger critical transfer threshold. The line
   width increased as the laser fluence increased. For all continuous
   formed lines, the cross-sectional morphologies with single and double
   peaks were shown at critical and above transfer threshold, respectively.
   Two symmetrical protrusions with steep edges were observed for the
   formed line with double peaks. By comparing the silver paste remaining
   on the donor and transferred to the acceptor under different laser
   fluences, it can be found the transferred silver paste exhibited a
   retracting characteristic under the critical and above transfer
   threshold. While a stretching characteristic was obvious when the laser
   fluence was much higher than the transfer threshold. Morphological
   characteristics with single or double peaks were determined by the
   distance between the rupture position of the bridge and the bottom of
   the bubble, under the action of the axial combined forces. This work can
   provide insights for improving fine-line metallization and understanding
   transfer mechanisms in the photovoltaic application and flexible
   electronics devices.},

Title = {Influence of Blade Type on the Flow Structure of a Vortex Pump for
   Solid-Liquid Two-Phase Flow},
Journal = {MACHINES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Vortex pumps have good non-clogging performance owing to their impellers
   being retracted into retraction cavities, but they are much less
   efficient than ordinary centrifugal pumps. In this paper, numerical
   simulations were performed on a model of the 150WX200-20 vortex pump for
   four different blade types, and the influence of blade structure on pump
   performance was determined. The simulations revealed the existence of
   axial vortices in the flow passage between the blades in the impeller
   region. The geometric characteristics of these axial vortices were more
   regular in two-phase solid-liquid flow than single-phase liquid flow.
   The presence of the solid phase reduced the vortex strength compared
   with the single-phase flow and suppressed the increase in size of the
   secondary circulation vortex. It was found, however, that the blade
   shape had a greater influence on the circulating flow than the presence
   of the solid phase. The flow state of the medium flowing out of the
   impeller domain had a direct effect on the circulating flow with this
   effect being related to the law governing the flow of the medium in the
   flow channel between the blades. It was found that the performance of a
   front-bent blade was the best and that of a curved blade the worst. This
   influence of blade type on the internal flow structure was used to
   further explain the relationship between the internal flow structure and
   the external characteristics of the vortex pump, the understanding of
   which is crucial for blade selection and hydraulic optimization.},

Abstract = {A novel manufacturing means for arrays of carbon fibers with diameters
   less than 10 nm has been developed. The method improves dramatically
   upon the state of the art of making carbon fibers by pyrolysis of near
   field electrospun (NFES) polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers. The conductive
   nature of the PAN ink, touch and retract mode of the droplet at the
   ejector needle tip and a rotating drum for jet initiation as well as a
   tight control of the ink flow and droplet shape with a porous paper
   enable continuous near field electrospinning at an ultra-low voltage of
   35 V - far below current low-voltage NFES practice. By pyrolyzing the
   thus obtained thinner PAN nanofibers on carbon scaffolds, a dramatic
   further shrinkage of the diameter leads to ultrathin carbon nanofibers
   e.g. from an similar to 245 nm polymer fiber to an similar to 5 nm
   carbon fiber i.e. a 4900\% reduction in fiber diameter. To increase and
   survive the thinning during the pyrolysis process, PAN stabilization at
   a relatively low temperature (115 degrees C) and carbon support
   scaffolds are implemented to provide just the right amount of tension of
   the suspended polymer nanofibers. A small inter-fiber spacing (<8 mu m)
   of the ultrathin carbon fibers in an array is achieved by simultaneously
   controlling the linear speed of the spinneret and the rotational speed
   of the collector. In one application, we demonstrate aligned ultra-thin
   carbon fibers freely suspended and in good ohmic contact with carbon
   scaffolds on a silicon substrate.},

   scoping analysis},
Journal = {AIDS RESEARCH AND THERAPY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an acquired
   defect of the cellular immunity associated with the infection by the
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The disease has reached pandemic
   proportion and has been considered a public health concern. This study
   is aimed at analyzing the trend of HIV/AIDS research in Nigeria. Method:
   We used the PUBMED database to a conduct bibliometric analysis of
   HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria from 1986 to 2021 employing ``HIV
   ``, ``AIDS ``, ``acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ``, ``Human
   immunodeficiency virus ``, and ``Nigeria `` as search description. The
   most common bibliometric indicators were applied for the selected
   publications. Result: The number of scientific research articles
   retrieved for HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria was 2796. Original
   research was the predominant article type. Articles authored by 4
   authors consisted majority of the papers. The University of Ibadan was
   found to be the most productive institution. Institutions in the United
   States dominated external production with the University of Maryland at
   the top. The most utilized journal was PLoS ONE. While Iliyasu Z. was
   the most productive principal author, Crowel TA. was the overall most
   productive author with the highest collaborative strength. The keyword
   analysis using overlay visualization showed a gradual shift from disease
   characteristics to diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Trend in
   HIV/AIDS research in Nigeria is increasing yet evolving. Four articles
   were retracted while two had an expression of concern. Conclusion: The
   growth of scientific literature in HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria
   was found to be high and increasing. However, the hotspot analysis still
   shows more unexplored grey areas in future.},

Title = {Efficient Spatial Sampling for AFM-Based Cancer Diagnostics: A
   Comparison between Neural Networks and Conventional Data Analysis},
Journal = {CONDENSED MATTER},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in spectroscopy mode receives a lot of
   attention because of its potential in distinguishing between healthy and
   cancer tissues. However, the AFM translational process in clinical
   practice is hindered by the fact that it is a time-consuming technique
   in terms of measurement and analysis time. In this paper, we attempt to
   address both issues. We propose the use of neural networks for pattern
   recognition to automatically classify AFM force-distance (FD) curves,
   with the aim of avoiding curve-fitting with the Sneddon model or more
   complicated ones. We investigated the applicability of this method to
   the classification of brain cancer tissues. The performance of the
   classifier was evaluated with receiving operating characteristic (ROC)
   curves for the approach and retract curves separately and in combination
   with each other. Although more complex and comprehensive models are
   required to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed
   approach, preliminary evidence is given for the accuracy of the results,
   and arguments are presented to support the possible applicability of
   neural networks to the classification of brain cancer tissues. Moreover,
   we propose a possible strategy to shorten measurement times based on the
   estimation of the minimum number of FD curves needed to classify a
   tissue with a confidence level of 0.005. Taken together, these results
   have the potential to stimulate the design of more effective protocols
   to reduce AFM measurement times and to get rid of curve-fitting, which
   is a complex and time-consuming issue that requires experienced staff
   with a strong data-analysis background.},

Abstract = {During laparoscopic surgery, tissues frequently need to be retracted and
   mobilized for manipulation or visualisation. State-of-the-art robotic
   platforms for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) typically rely on rigid
   tools to interact with soft tissues. Such tools offer a very narrow
   contact surface thus applying relatively large forces that can lead to
   tissue damage, posing a risk for the success of the procedure and
   ultimately for the patient. In this paper, we show how the use of
   Pneumatically Attachable Flexible (PAF) rail, a vacuum-based soft
   attachment for laparoscopic applications, can reduce such risk by
   offering a larger contact surface between the tool and the tissue. Ex
   vivo experiments are presented investigating the short- and long-term
   effects of different levels of vacuum pressure on the tissues surface.
   These experiments aim at evaluating the best trade-off between applied
   pressure, potential damage, task duration and connection stability. A
   hybrid control system has been developed to perform and investigate the
   organ repositioning task using the proposed system. The task is only
   partially automated allowing the surgeon to be part of the control loop.
   A gradient-based planning algorithm is integrated with learning from
   teleoperation algorithm which allows the robot to improve the learned
   trajectory. The use of Similar Smooth Path Repositioning (SSPR)
   algorithm is proposed to improve a demonstrated trajectory based on a
   known cost function. The results obtained show that a smoother
   trajectory allows to decrease the minimum level of pressure needed to
   guarantee active suction during PAF positioning and placement.},

Abstract = {Let G be a finite p-group and k a field of characteristic p > 0. A
   universal Galois algebra of G is a weakly initial object in the category
   Ts of trace-surjective (commutative) k - G algebras. The objects in Ts
   are precisely the k - G-algebras that are Galois ring extensions over
   the ring of G-invariants. They are also characterized as k - G algebras
   which are free kG-modules. One example is D-k, the dehomogenized
   symmetric algebra of the regular representation, which is also an
   s-projective object in Ts (see the definition in the paper). In the
   previous work we proved that the polynomial ring D-k (of dimension
   vertical bar G vertical bar - 1) contains a polynomial retract U is an
   element of Ts of dimension n := log(p)(vertical bar G vertical bar),
   such that the invariant rings U-G and D-k(G); are again polynomial
   rings. The G-action on U will in general be highly non-linear, but in
   special cases it can be chosen to be ``almost linear{''}. In this paper
   we investigate such almost linear universal algebras, generalizing the
   construction of the algebras D-k and U. It is known that for k = F-p the
   minimal dimension of a polynomial universal algebra is n. Among other
   things we prove that such an algebra can be realized in an ``almost
   linear{''} way, if and only if G is ``crossed isomorphic{''} to an
   F-p-vector space. This is equivalent to the existence of a kG-module V
   such that there is 0 not equal {[}rho] is an element of H-1(G, V) with p
   is an element of Z(1)(C. V) being a bijective cocycle. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is a non-surgical approach used
   to open narrowed coronary arteries and restore arterial blood flow to
   heart tissue. During a PCI procedure, the clinician uses X-ray
   fluoroscopy to visualize and guide the catheter, guidewire, and other
   devices (e.g. angioplasty balloons and stents). Robot-assisted PCI could
   potentially reduce the radiation exposure of operators and provide a
   more ergonomic workflow. However, modeling and controlling of the
   guidewire remains challenging because of the interplay of guidewire
   motions, the tip properties (e.g., loads, coating), and the local
   cross-sectional area of the vessel lumen (e.g, stenosis) and results in
   a highly non-linear system. Thus, robot-assisted PCI devices are still
   passively controlled by human operators at the cockpit. In this paper,
   we introduce methods to generate distal guidewire motions that take
   advantage of the fast response of a robotic system and which may be
   difficult to generate by a human hand. The fundamental motions that a
   robot can use to control the movement and direction of the guidewire are
   rotation and pushing/retracting, from the proximal end of the guidewire
   outside the insertion point on the patient's body. We begin by
   investigating combinations of these fundamental motions under structured
   environmental settings and conduct a systematic empirical comparison of
   task completion time for a given setting. We then demonstrate improved
   dynamic behavior motions for a soft guidewire, which shows a promising
   speed-up by 33\% and 44\% for two difficult stenosis cases.},

Title = {Temporally programmed cyclic deformation to control structural hierarchy
   and shrinkage in poly lactic acid films},
Journal = {POLYMER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {266},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {In this paper we explore the role of programmed deformation history on
   the strain induced crystallization-crystalline order and chain
   orientation developed in initially amorphous poly lactic acid films in
   rubbery state. For this purpose, we use highly instrumented programmable
   uniaxial stretcher that captures true strain, true stress, birefringence
   continuously during processing. Using this highly instrumented tool, we
   apply deformation up to strategically selected strain levels where
   initially amorphous PLA film potentially could strain-crystallize. This
   is followed by small strain cycling to affect the level of orientation
   and order in crystalline and amorphous phases through stretch-retract
   sequence. With application of strain cycling following deformation near
   strain hardening and beyond, the crystalline chain orientation increases
   dramatically as the oriented amorphous regions are allowed to relax to
   form oriented crystals as the number of sites forming crystals increases
   and unoriented amorphous regions are then oriented in subsequent cycles.
   Deformation followed by small strain cycling lead to near perfect
   crystalline chain orientation and high crystallinity but smaller
   crystallite sizes especially under moderate total strains. For the first
   time, stretching plus strain cycling the thermal shrinkage in oriented
   films has been shown to substantially decrease at the same overall
   strain levels as the fraction of taut oriented amorphous chains reduces
   while the number of crystalline sites increases substantially leading to
   a more thermally stable morphology. This opens new processing step that
   can be employed in large tenter frame biaxial stretching machines
   together with heat setting to produce thermally stable substrates.},

Abstract = {The campinas and campinaranas are Amazonian ecosystems of great value,
   especially in the Rio Negro Basin. The campinaranas are an forest
   phytophysiognomy where C-4 metabolism plants predominate. The campinas
   are an grassland phytophysiognomy characterized by the abundance of C-3
   plants. These ecosystems are often associated to Spodosols. These soils
   have a Bh horizon formed by the humus migration from the surface
   horizons and subsequently accumulate in some region of the profile.
   Studies have shown that the dynamics of contraction and expansion
   between campinas and campinaranas are related to pedogenetic and
   morphogenetic processes. The goals of this paper is to verify if there
   have been expansion or contraction of the campinas over the campinaranas
   in the study area the and propose a model to explain this dynamic. A
   transect was established from the edge of the low plateau toward its
   center so as to include the main the phytophysiognomies of the region.
   Along this transect pits were opened for pedological description and
   sample collection for physicochemical and carbon isotope ratio analysis.
   The latter was performed on samples of the A and Bh horizons. The
   interpretations made based on the available literature about the region
   landscape evolution, results of physical analysis and carbon isotope
   ratio analysis suggest the campinaranas, which are associated with
   Spodosols, have expanded and the campinas that lies on Gleysols and
   Histosols are retracting. The driving process of this dynamics is
   related to incision of the watercourses on the plateaus culminating in
   drainage and clay depletion of the plateaus.},

Title = {A Closer Look at the Short Front Vowel Shift in Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},
Pages = {91-119},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines several aspects of the ``Short Front Vowel Shift{''}
   (SFVS) in Canadian English, known in most previous research as the
   ``Canadian Vowel Shift.{''} It is based on acoustic analysis of a list
   of one hundred words produced by sixty-one Canadian and thirty-one
   American university students. The analysis focuses on three questions:
   (1) the relations among the vowels involved in the shift, including
   relations with vowels not traditionally considered part of the shift;
   (2) the behavior of individual words in each vowel category, which
   displays allophonic variation; and (3) the role of regional and national
   identity (western versus eastern Canadian, and Canadian versus American)
   and speaker sex in predicting the degree of participation in the shift,
   which is measured with a unitary quantitative index of the shift that is
   proposed here for the first time. The analysis finds that the short
   front vowels (kit, dress, and trap) lower and retract as a set, but that
   shifts of several back vowels (particularly foot, goat, and strut) are
   also correlated but not necessarily structurally connected with these;
   that following voiceless fricatives favor the SFVS while preceding
   velars disfavor it; that women are more advanced in the shift than men;
   that there is no regional difference within Canada in the progress of
   the shift; and, most surprisingly, that, once the American comparison
   group is restricted to those with a low-back merger, Americans are more
   shifted than their Canadian peers, calling into question the association
   of the shift with Canada in most previous research on Canadian English.},

Volume = {120},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional images have become an important
   tool in understanding surgical anatomy. This paper describes a simple
   method for obtaining endoscopic 3-dimensional anatomic images for
   teaching purposes.
   METHODS: This method uses a single endoscope that provides regular,
   two-dimensional images. Obtaining the three-dimensional image requires
   the superposition of two similar hut slightly different images of the
   same object. The set of images, one mimicking the view of the left eye
   and the other mimicking the view of the right eye, constitute the
   stereoscopic pair of images obtained with the endoscope. To construct
   3-dimensional images, the distance between the pictures must approximate
   the interpupillary distance.
   RESULTS: The technique involves fixing the endoscope in position using a
   self-retracting arm and placing the specimen on a simple sliding tray
   with an adapted millimeter scale to control the distance between the
   pictures. The initial still image is captured and the tray on which the
   specimen sits is shifted up to 3-4 mm laterally to capture the second
   image. As a general rule, one can calculate the distance between the
   pictures by moving the specimen laterally 1/30 of the distance between
   the lens and the object. Images captured are processed using anaglyphic
   technique for printing and horizontal-vertical polarization of light for
   presentation to larger audiences.
   CONCLUSIONS: Images produced in this way may aid in the understanding of
   the depth of different structures and ease of learning curve for the use
   of the endoscopy in neurosurgery.},

Abstract = {As large numbers of increasingly smaller spacecraft continue to be

   significant accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The paper also
   presents a novel guidance tracking algorithm whereby the drag device of
   a spacecraft is deployed or retracted relative to a nominal deployment
   profile (given in the guidance) based on the difference between the
   actual and desired state of the spacecraft. A full state feedback
   linear-quadratic-regulator control scheme is utilized with the
   Schweighart Sedgwick equations of relative motion to drive the relative
   position and velocity between the spacecraft and the guidance trajectory
   to zero. A problem-specific Extended Kalman Filter implementation is
   also introduced to remove noise from the GPS-derived relative motion
   estimate.
   One thousand Monte Carlo simulations of the guidance generation
   algorithm with randomized initial conditions and desired re-entry
   locations are conducted, resulting in an average guidance error of 12.5
   km and a maximum error below 106 km. The tracking of these aerodynamic
   decay guidances with the aforementioned algorithms is also simulated
   with drag force uncertainties up to a factor of two and navigation
   errors (noise and bias) comparable to that expected from a CubeSat GPS
   unit. Despite these simulated errors and uncertainties, this approach
   provides guidance tracking down to a re-entry altitude of 120 km with a
   final position error under 6 km for all cases. The algorithms detailed
   in this paper provide a way for any spacecraft capable of modulating its
   drag area to autonomously perform orbital maneuvers and execute a
   precise re-entry.},

Title = {Fabrication and characterization of multiscale spherical artificial
   compound eye with self-cleaning and anti-icing properties},
Journal = {RESULTS IN PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The self-cleaning and de-icing phenomenon is magical in nature, and of
   practical importance in daily life and industrial activities. The paper
   studies the inclined impact behaviour of drop on the various surfaces,
   i.e., micronano hierarchy and multiscale artificial compound eye (ACE).
   The droplet experiences first spreading, then retract, and finally
   detach from the surface with different contact time, which results from
   the different solid fraction tuned by chemical time. Moreover, the
   anti-icing property of the hierarchical surfaces was further
   demonstrated and discussed. Results show that the hierarchical surfaces
   endow excellent anti-icing properties compared with the planar surface.
   For reaction time of 40 min, the hierarchy has delay time of 800 s,
   which almost three times the planar surface. Further, curved ACE was
   fabricated by laser swelling, gas-assisted deformation and chemical
   growth. The nanohairs was fully covered on the surface of ACE. The
   imaging property was tested in the experiment. The nanohairs greatly
   enhance the hydrophobicity compared with the regular ACE. The contact
   angles for regular ACE and ACE with nanohairs was 105 degrees and 160
   degrees, respectively. Besides the static hydrophobic performance, the
   dynamic dewetting behavior is also tested. For regular ACE, the contact
   droplets stick to the surface; while for ACE with nanohairs, the
   droplets fully detach the curved surface with a contact time of similar
   to 8.75 ms for Weber number (We) of 66. These findings are believed to
   provide guideline for preparation of surfaces for both self-cleaning and
   anti-icing purposes and paves the way for practical applications of the
   ACE.},

Title = {The k-homotopic thinning and a torus-like digital image in Z(n)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {31},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In order to discuss digital topological properties of a digital image (
   X, k), many recent papers have used the digital fundamental group and
   several digital topological invariants such as the k-linking number, the
   k-topological number, and so forth. Owing to some difficulties of an
   establishment of the multiplicative property of the digital fundamental
   group, a k-homotopic thinning method can be essentially used in
   calculating the digital fundamental group of a digital product with
   k-adjacency. More precisely, let SC(ki)(ni,li) be a simple closed
   k(i)-curve with l(i) elements in Z(ni), i epsilon \{1,2\}. For some
   k-adjacency of the digital product Sc(k1)(n1,l1) x Sc(k2)(n2,l2) subset
   of Z(n1 + n2) which is a torus-like set, proceeding with the k-homotopic
   thinning of Sc(k1)(n1,l1) x Sc(k2)(n2,l2) ,we obtain its k-homotopic
   thinning set denoted by DT(k). Writing an algorithm for calculating the
   digital fundamental group of Sc(k1)(n1,l1) x Sc(k2)(n2,l2) ,we
   investigate the k-fundamental group of (Sc(k1)(n1,l1) x Sc(k2)(n2,l2),
   k) by the use of various properties of a digital covering (Zx Z,p(1) x
   p(2),DT(k)), a strong k-deformation retract, and algebraic topological
   tools. Finally, we find the pseudo-multiplicative property ( contrary to
   the multiplicative property) of the digital fundamental group. This
   property can be used in classifying digital images from the view points
   of both digital k-homotopy theory and mathematical morphology.},

Title = {Distant Supervision Relation Extraction via adaptive dependency-path and
   additional knowledge graph supervision},
Journal = {NEURAL NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {134},
Pages = {42-53},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Relation Extraction systems train an extractor by aligning relation
   instances in Knowledge Base with a large amount of labeled corpora.
   Since the labeled datasets are very expensive, Distant Supervision
   Relation Extraction (DSRE) utilizes rough corpus annotated with
   Knowledge Graph to reduce the cost of acquisition. Nevertheless, the
   data noise problem limits the performance of the DSRE. Dependency trees
   can be used to filter the wrong-labeled instances in the distant
   supervision bag. However, existing dependency tree relation extraction
   strategies are all based on manually-set paths between the subject and
   object entities, and suffer from the problem of pruning the trees too
   aggressively or too insufficiently. To circumvent the shortcomings, in
   this paper, we propose a novel DSRE framework A2DSRE, based on the
   Adaptive dependency-path and Additional KG supervision. To obtain the
   dependency paths related to entity relations adaptively, we introduce an
   advanced graph neural network-GeniePath into DSRE, which assigns higher
   weights to those direct neighbor words that contribute more to relation
   prediction through breadth exploration, and conducts depth exploration
   to determine the correlation between relations and high-order neighbors.
   In this way, the irrelevant nodes are pruned while the relevant nodes
   are kept, our method can obtain more appropriate paths associated with
   relations. At the same time, to further reduce the noises in the data,
   we incorporate additional supervision information from the knowledge
   graph by retracting the margin between the representation of the bag and
   the pre-training knowledge graph embedding. Extensive numerical
   experiments validate the effectiveness of our new method. (C) 2020

Title = {Relation of Coronal Rain Originating from Coronal Condensations to
   Interchange Magnetic Reconnection},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {905},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Using extreme-ultraviolet images, we recently proposed a new and
   alternative formation mechanism for coronal rain along magnetically open
   field lines due to interchange magnetic reconnection. In this paper we
   report coronal rain at chromospheric and transition region temperatures
   originating from the coronal condensations facilitated by reconnection
   between open and closed coronal loops. For this, we employ the Interface
   Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
   (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Around 2013 October 19, a
   coronal rain along curved paths was recorded by IRIS over the
   southeastern solar limb. Related to this, we found reconnection between
   a system of higher-lying open features and lower-lying closed loops that
   occurs repeatedly in AIA images. In this process, the higher-lying
   features form magnetic dips. In response, two sets of newly reconnected
   loops appear and retract away from the reconnection region. In the dips,
   seven events of cooling and condensation of coronal plasma repeatedly
   occur due to thermal instability over several days, from October 18 to
   20. The condensations flow downward to the surface as coronal rain, with
   a mean interval between condensations of similar to 6.6 hr. In the cases
   where IRIS data were available we found the condensations to cool all
   the way down to chromospheric temperatures. Based on our observations we
   suggest that some of the coronal rain events observed at chromospheric
   temperatures could be explained by the new and alternative scenario for
   the formation of coronal rain, where the condensation is facilitated by
   interchange reconnection.},

Title = {The Dataflow Model: A Practical Approach to Balancing Correctness,
   Latency, and Cost in Massive-Scale, Unbounded, Out-of-Order Data

Abstract = {Lnhounded, unordered, global-scale datasets are increasingly common in
   day-to-day business (e.g. Web logs, mobile usage statistics, and sensor
   networks). At the same time, consumers of these datasets have evolved
   sophisticated requirements, such as event time ordering and windowing by
   features of the data themselves, in addition to an insatiable hunger for
   faster answers. Meanwhile, practicality dictates that one can never
   fully optimize along all dimensions of correctness, latency, and cost
   for these types of input. As a result, data processing practitioners are
   left with the quandary of how to reconcile the tensions between these
   seemingly competing propositions, often resulting in disparate
   implementations and systems.
   We propose that a fundamental shift of approach is necessary to deal
   with these evolved requirements in modern data processing. We as a field
   must stop trying to groom unbounded datasets into finite pools of
   information that eventually become complete, and instead live and
   breathe under the assumption that we will never know if or when we have
   seen all of our data, only that new data will arrive, old data, may be
   retracted, and the only way to make this problem tractable is via
   principled abstractions that allow the practitioner the choice of
   appropriate Ixadeolls along the axes of interest: correctness, latency,
   and cost.
   In this paper, we present one such approach, the Dataflow Model(1),
   along with a detailed examination of the semantics it enables, an
   overview of the core principles that guided its design, and a validation
   of the model itself via the real-world experiences that led to its
   development.},

   outcomes recorded after treatment of the contralateral side Follow-up at
   12 months was performed with a subjective assessment carried out by a
   questionnaire administered to patients while objective result assessment
   was performed 12 months after surgery by two independent blind
   examiners. Results The eyelid upward reposition has improved one year
   after fat grafting in both bilateral (1,52 mm) and unilateral (1,7 mm)
   population: the latter allowed to statistically validate (P<0.05) the
   result with respect to the not affected site. Conclusions This is the
   first paper that highlights the outcomes of sole fat injection in the
   treatment of lower eyelid retraction: blind objective evaluation of
   surgical outcomes along with a patient assessment of both functional and
   aesthetic improvement one year after surgery confirm its efficacy and
   reliability along with the first case/control outcome evaluation of the
   technique carried on in the sub-population of 29 patients affected by
   unilateral lower eyelid retraction that validate the average improvement
   of the retracted eyelid one year after fat grafting as statistically
   significant. Nevertheless, longer follow-up periods and a larger sample
   size are needed to thoroughly confirm surgical outcomes and statistical
   results.},

Title = {Coarticulation, assimilation and blending in Catalan consonant clusters},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHONETICS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {273-301},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Electropalatographic data on C-to-C coarticulatory effects were analyzed
   for consonant clusters composed of an extensive set of Catalan
   consonants, i.e., dentals (t), alveolars (n, dark l, s, trilled r),
   alveolopalatals (integral, gimel, eta), palatals (j) and velars (k).
   Regarding tongue dorsum coarticulation, results show that consonantal
   effects in CC clusters are more prominent than vocalic effects in VCV
   sequences which is attributed to differences in articulatory control
   between consonants and vowels. Moreover, tongue dorsum lowering for the
   alveolar fricative and for the alveolar trill appears to be more
   coarticulation resistant than tongue dorsum raising and fronting for
   alveolopalatals. Data at the place of articulation show some interesting
   trends: on the one hand, sequences made of dentals (t), and fronter
   alveolars and alveolopalatals (i.e., n, l, gimel, eta) yield
   articulatory blending; on the other hand, any of these consonants may
   assimilate to those alveolar and alveolopalatal consonants which exhibit
   a more retracted place of articulation (s, r, integral), but not vice
   versa. These findings are in agreement with the ``degree of articulatory
   constraint{''} (DAC) model which relates coarticulatory and assimilatory
   effects to the degree of articulatory constraint involved in consonantal
   production, and predicts that fricatives and trills should be highly
   constrained both at the tongue front and at the tongue dorsum. Data on
   the relative strength of the anticipatory and carry-over effects
   reported in this paper are also to a large extent in agreement with
   predictions of the DAC model. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

Title = {Power, Habitus, and National Character: The Figurational Dynamics of

Journal = {HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Most explanations that have sought to understand the ``causes{''} of
   Brexit have tended to focus on the idea of a ``left-behind{''} white
   working class who were exercising a protest against a liberal elite.
   Other approaches have cited the roles played by a broader demographic in
   Britain, or have identified ``cleavages{''} between ``nationalist{''}
   and ``cosmopolitan{''} normative codes. However, such approaches
   typically fail to address the complexities of longer-term social
   processes which have been fundamental to Brexit. The analytical models
   used to explain these cleavages have tended to conceptualise the
   relationships between the two codes as irreconcilable opposites, rather
   than as shifting balances in the context of changing social conditions.
   In this paper, we focus upon understanding Brexit as part of a set of
   longer-term developments in human figurations involving moves towards
   greater integration with concurrent countervailing disintegrative
   pressures. These shifting patterns of integration and disintegration
   involve changes of habitus, balances of power (such as functional
   democratisation), and expanding and retracting spans of emotional
   identification. The relationship these processes have to early
   nation-state formation in Europe are critical, exposing how the dualisms
   in national codes have been fundamental to the formation of national
   identities since the Renaissance. Our central argument is developments
   in these areas of human interdependence have contributed to recent
   centripetal shifts towards more nationalistic normative codes, and the
   resulting cleavages being witnessed in Europe, the United States, and
   indeed, across the world. We explore these shifting relational dynamics
   and show how a longer-term developmental approach helps to move the
   debate beyond present-centred and static considerations.},

Abstract = {A non-commercial power reactor based on HTGR technology is being
   developed in Indonesia. Controlling the power generated from such
   reactor can be conducted both by maneuvering control rod and helium
   circulation flow. Inserting and retracting the control rods to achieve
   their intended position accurately required a control rod drive
   mechanism and control system. This paper discusses the preliminary
   design of the control rod control and monitoring system developed for a
   non-commercial power reactor or in Indonesian is called as Reaktor Daya
   Non-Komersial (RDNK). The design was developed with considering RDNK
   operation characteristics, safety standards, and proven technology for
   control rod control system design applied to other nuclear reactors. The
   preliminary design was based on a digital system which comprises of
   three main parts that are Rod control system, reactor control system,
   and user interface system. The rod control system includes logic cabinet
   and power cabinet which provide electric current to energize the coils
   of the control rod drive mechanism. The designed system is used to
   control and monitor ten control rods of RDNK where each drive mechanism
   was designed to drive a single control rod. The control rods are located
   at the reflector side instead of the core region. Moreover, the
   operation characteristics of RDNK, such as high-temperature envelope was
   also considered in the design and selection of control rod control
   systems component parts. The result achieved in this study would be used
   further to develop detail design of control rod drive mechanism and
   control systems of RDNK.},

Title = {Reduction in the contact time of droplet impact on superhydrophobic
   surface with protrusions},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF FLUIDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Previous studies have pointed out that adding a single protrusion on the
   superhydrophobic surface can effectively reduce the contact time of
   droplets, which is of practical importance in applications like
   anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-frost. However, the droplet impact
   dynamics and the mechanism for contact time reduction are still far from
   completely understood. Therefore, in this paper, via a three-dimensional
   pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model coupled with a modified curved
   boundary scheme (which satisfies mass conservation), the droplet impact
   dynamics is simulated in a wide range of Weber numbers (0 < We <= 67.7),
   protrusion size (10 <= W <= 30), and protrusion shape (triangle, square,
   and circle), with particular interest in understanding their effects on
   the contact time. We demonstrate that the variation of contact time
   depends on the bouncing type as well as the retraction way. Among three
   possible bouncing types observed in the simulation, including non-break
   bouncing, two droplets bouncing, and three droplets bouncing, two
   droplets bouncing has less contact time and could be facilitated by
   increasing We and using triangle protrusion. However, with increasing of
   W or using square protrusion, the bouncing type may change from two
   droplets bouncing to three droplets bouncing, and the deformation of
   fragments may become definitely different, leading to a long contact
   time. In addition, a transition from twice-retraction to once-retraction
   can be obtained by increasing We or making the protrusion shape sharp.
   When the fragments resulting from droplet splitting only retract once on
   the bottom wall, the contact time can be effectively reduced.},

Title = {The SPA arrangement of the branches of the upper trunk of the brachial
   plexus: a correction of a longstanding misconception and a new diagram
   of the brachial plexus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {125},
Number = {2},
Pages = {350-354},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Brachial plexus (BP) diagrams in most textbooks and papers
   represent the branches and divisions of the upper trunk (UT) in the
   following sequence from cranial to caudal: suprascapular nerve, anterior
   division, and then posterior division. This concept contradicts what is
   seen in the operating room and is noticed by most peripheral nerve
   surgeons. This cadaveric study was conducted to look specifically at the
   exact pattern of branching of the upper trunk of the BP.
   METHODS Ten cadavers (20 BPs) were dissected. Both supra- and
   infraclavicular exposures were performed. The clavicle was retracted or
   resected to identify the divisions of the BP. A posterior approach was
   used in 2 cases.
   RESULTS In all dissections the origin of the posterior division was in a
   more cranial and dorsal plane in relation to the anterior division. In
   most dissections the supra scapular nerve branched off distally from the
   UT, giving it the appearance of a trifurcation, taking off just cranial
   and dorsal to the posterior division. The branching pattern of the UT
   consistently had the following sequential arrangement from cranial and
   posterior to caudal and anterior: suprascapular nerve (S), posterior
   division (P), and anterior division (A), hence the acronym SPA.
   CONCLUSIONS Supraclavicular exposure of the BP exposes only the trunks
   and divisions. Recognizing the ``SPA{''} arrangement of the branches
   helps in identifying the correct targets for neurotization, especially
   given that these 3 branches are the most common targets for BP repair.
   Understanding the anatomy means better surgical planning and better
   patient outcomes.},

Abstract = {To study the web-shear behavior of a region with an inflection point,
   five externally prestressed T-shaped beams with overhangs on one side
   were designed with different shear-span ratios and moment ratios. The
   specimens were tested to failure under corresponding concentrated loads.
   By investigating the crack-development behavior, failure mode, and
   mechanical behavior of the specimens, the following conclusions were
   obtained: both the shear span ratio and moment ratio could significantly
   affect the formation and development of diagonal cracks and the
   redistribution of internal stresses in the specimens. The web-shear
   failure mode of the specimens could be defined as a
   shear-compression-sliding failure that was notably different from that
   of specimens without external tendons. At failure, the concrete in the
   shear-compression zone was first destroyed in the region with a higher
   absolute value of moment. Subsequently, external prestressing tendons
   lost support, retracted elastically, and released a large amount of
   elastic strain energy. As a result, the two portions of the specimen
   separated by the failure crack slid against each other. The specimens
   all failed completely and violently as soon as the ultimate loads were
   reached. All the stirrups crossed by the critical web-shear cracks were
   ruptured, and the longitudinal steels in the top and bottom flanges had
   buckled. The capacity of two design codes to accurately predict the
   shear strength of the specimens-the ACI Code and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge
   Design Specifications-was investigated through the experiments performed
   in this paper.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {The current pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid construction of
   structures to treat patients and ensure manufacturing of health care
   products such as vaccines. In order to achieve this, rapid
   transportation of construction materials from staging area to deposition
   is needed. In the future, this could be achieved through automated
   construction sites that make use of robots. Toward this, in this paper a
   cable driven parallel manipulator (CDPM) is designed and built to
   balance a highly unstable load, a ball plate system. The system consists
   of eight cables attached to the end effector plate that can be extended
   or retracted to actuate movement of the plate. The hardware for the
   system was designed and built utilizing modern manufacturing processes.
   A camera system was designed using image recognition to identify the
   ball pose on the plate. The hardware was used to inform the development
   of a control system consisting of a reinforcement-learning trained
   neural network controller that outputs the desired platform response. A
   nested PID controller for each motor attached to each cable was used to
   realize the desired response. For the neural network controller, three
   different model structures were compared to assess the impact of varying
   model complexity. It was seen that less complex structures resulted in a
   slower response that was less flexible and more complex structures
   output a high frequency oscillation of the actuation signal resulting in
   an unresponsive system. It was concluded that the system showed promise
   for future development with the potential to improve on the state of the
   art.},

Title = {Dynamic behavior of water drops impacting on cylindrical
   superhydrophobic surfaces},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF FLUIDS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the impact behavior between water drops with
   different velocities and cylindrical superhydrophobic surfaces with
   various diameters and presents two possible outcomes of drop impact,
   which are asymmetric rebound and stretched breakup. Due to the special
   cylindrical topology of the surface, drops undergo an asymmetric
   spreading and retracting process in the azimuthal and the axial
   direction, which results in three types of asymmetric rebound, including
   jug-like rebound, wing-like rebound, and rebound breakup. The stretched
   breakup is observed in the collision of drops with higher impact
   velocities and smaller cylinder diameters. The diameter ratio D{*} and
   Weber number We are found to be the determinants of the bouncing
   patterns. With the decrease in the diameter ratio D{*} or the increase
   in the Weber number We, the bouncing patterns transformed from jug-like
   rebound through wing-like rebound and finally to stretched breakup. We
   put forward a modification form of the Weber number (alpha = We/D{*})
   affected by the diameter ratio D{*}, indicating the ratio between the
   inertia force and the surface tension, as the criterion to distinguish
   the upward rebound from the downward stretch, which helps obtain the
   linear relation of critical We(cr) and D{*}(cr). Furthermore, asymmetric
   rebound and stretched breakup could effectively shorten the contact time
   between drops and substrates. The contact time is found to be mainly
   determined by the dimensionless parameter a. The correlation between the
   dimensionless contact time and the dimensionless parameter alpha is
   demonstrated to be T-c proportional to alpha(n).},

Abstract = {Dynamic force microscopy is known for its ability to image soft
   materials without inducing severe damage. For such materials, the
   determination of the relative contributions of the topography and the
   local mechanical properties to the recorded image is of primary
   importance. In this paper, we show that a systematic comparison between
   images and approach-retract curve data allows the origin of the contrast
   to be straightforwardly evaluated. The method provides an unambiguous
   quantitative measurement of the contribution of the local mechanical
   response to the image. To achieve this goal, experimental results are
   recorded on a model system, a symmetric triblock copolymer, which
   possesses a lamellar morphology due to nanophase separation between
   elastomer and glassy domains. In this particular case, we show that most
   of the contrast in the height and phase images is due to variations of
   the local mechanical properties. As a step further, the analysis of the
   variation of the phase is carried out as a function of the tip-surface
   distance. Local variations of the phase can be linked to dissipative
   processes between the tip and the soft sample. When the tip touches the
   surface, viscous forces acting against the tip motion contribute to the
   phase lag. Depending on the tip apex geometry and on the nature of the
   sample, the relationships between the phase variations and the
   tip-surface distance can be derived. On that basis, we propose an
   approach to evaluate the viscosity at the nanometer scale. (C) 2002

Title = {Pathologic and physiologic phimosis - Approach to the phimotic foreskin},
Journal = {CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {445-448},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE To review the differences between physiologic and pathologic
   phimosis, re view proper foreskin care, and discuss when it is
   appropriate to seek consultation regarding a phimotic foreskin.
   SOURCES OF INFORMATION This paper is based on selected findings from a
   MEDLINE search for literature on phimosis and circumcision referrals and
   on our experience at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Urology
   clinic. MeSH headings used in our MEDLINE search included
   ``phimosis,{''} ``referral and consultation,{''} and ``circumcision.{''}
   Most of the available articles about phimosis and foreskin referrals
   were retrospective reviews and cohort Studies (levels II and III
   evidence).
   MAIN MESSAGE Phimosis is defined as the inability to retract the
   foreskin. Differentiating between physiologic and pathologic phimosis is
   important, as the former is managed conservatively and the latter
   requires surgical intervention. Great anxiety exists among patients and
   parents regarding non-retractile foreskins. Most phimosis referrals seen
   in pediatric urology clinics are normal physiologically phimotic
   foreskins. Referrals of patients with physiologic phimosis to urology
   clinics can create anxiety about the need for surgery among patients and
   parents, while unnecessarily expanding the waiting list for specialty
   assessment. Uncircumcised penises require no special care. With normal
   washing, using soap and water, and gentle retraction during urination
   and bathing, most foreskins will become retractile over time.
   CONCLUSION Physiologic phimosis is often seen by family physicians.
   These patients and their parents require reassurance of normalcy and
   reinforcement of proper preputial hygiene. Consultation should be sought
   when evidence of pathologic phimosis is present, as this requires
   surgical management.},

Abstract = {The impact of liquid droplet on solid surfaces or liquid films occurs
   frequently in nature and industrial fields. Scholars have carried out
   many experimental and numerical simulation researches on the droplet
   impact phenomena, especially on the dynamic processes of the impact on
   the flat. The droplet impact on curve surfaces has special
   characteristics due to the shape differences between flats and curve
   surfaces. The research progress of the droplet impact on curve surfaces
   is summarized and the influence of the droplet impact velocity, surface
   wettability, curvature ratio, and impact angle on the dynamic
   characteristics is analyzed in this paper. The conclusions indicate that
   droplet impact process commonly includes the spread, retract, rebound
   and breakup or splash. If the droplet diameter is greater than the
   diameter of the curve surface, the spread process would turn into a
   coating process due to gravity. The rebound happens easily when a
   droplet impacts hydrophobic or superhydrophobic surfaces. The Splash
   happens more easily when the droplet has small surface tension or the
   surface has large roughness. Unsymmetrical spread occurs when a droplet
   obliquely impacts a curve surface, and the droplet would slide from one
   side or divide into two different parts. The study of the droplet impact
   on special curve surfaces, such as groove and dentate structures, is
   also summarized. The results indicate that the droplet tend to rebound
   on these special curve surfaces. Critical Weber number or critical
   dimensionless parameter K (K = Re-n.We(m)) is commonly used to describe
   the appearance of splashes.},

Abstract = {A recent publication by Seng et al. in this journal reports the
   crystallographic structure of refolded, full-length SMN protein and two
   disease-relevant derivatives thereof. Here, we would like to suggest
   that at least two of the structures reported in that study are
   incorrect. We present evidence that one of the associated
   crystallographic datasets is derived from a crystal of the bacterial
   Sm-like protein Hfq and that a second dataset is derived from a crystal
   of the bacterial Gab protein. Both proteins are frequent contaminants of
   bacterially overexpressed proteins which might have been co-purified
   during metal affinity chromatography. A third structure presented in the
   Seng et al. paper cannot be examined further because neither the atomic
   coordinates, nor the diffraction intensities were made publicly
   available. The Tudor domain protein SMN has been shown to be a component
   of the SMN complex, which mediates the assembly of RNA-protein complexes
   of uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs). Importantly,
   this activity is reduced in SMA patients, raising the possibility that
   the aetiology of SMA is linked to RNA metabolism. Structural studies on
   diverse components of the SMN complex, including fragments of SMN itself
   have contributed greatly to our understanding of the cellular UsnRNP
   assembly machinery. Yet full-length SMN has so far evaded structural
   elucidation. The Seng et al. study claimed to have closed this gap, but
   based on the results presented here, the only conclusion that can be
   drawn is that the Seng et al. study is largely invalid and should be
   retracted from the literature.},

Abstract = {Learning discriminative face features plays a major role in building
   high-performing face recognition models. The recent state-of-the-art
   face recognition solutions proposed to incorporate a fixed penalty
   margin on commonly used classification loss function, softmax loss, in
   the normalized hypersphere to increase the discriminative power of face
   recognition models, by minimizing the intra-class variation and
   maximizing the inter-class variation. Marginal penalty softmax losses,
   such as ArcFace and CosFace, assume that the geodesic distance between
   and within the different identities can be equally learned using a fixed
   penalty margin. However, such a learning objective is not realistic for
   real data with inconsistent inter-and intra-class variation, which might
   limit the discriminative and generalizability of the face recognition
   model. In this paper, we relax the fixed penalty margin constrain by
   proposing elastic penalty margin loss (ElasticFace) that allows
   flexibility in the push for class separability. The main idea is to
   utilize random margin values drawn from a normal distribution in each
   training iteration. This aims at giving the decision boundary chances to
   extract and retract to allow space for flexible class separability
   learning. We demonstrate the superiority of our ElasticFace loss over
   ArcFace and CosFace losses, using the same geometric transformation, on
   a large set of mainstream benchmarks. From a wider perspective, our
   ElasticFace has advanced the state-of-the-art face recognition
   performance on seven out of nine mainstream benchmarks. All training
   codes, pre-trained models, training logs will be publicly released (1).},

Title = {The dynamic contact angle of a bubble with an immersed-in-water particle
   and its implications for bubble-particle detachment},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {22-32},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {The contact angle is of great importance in measuring the wetting
   characteristics of mineral particles. The dynamic contact angle is more
   relevant to flotation than the static contact angle, as the flotation
   environment is generally in a turbulent regime. Therefore, the dynamic
   contact angle should be used in the calculation of the capillary force
   which stabilizes bubble-particle aggregates in a turbulent field. In
   this paper, the static contact angle and the dynamic contact angle of a
   bubble detaching from a 3 mm stainless steel particle were measured
   using a high speed camera. The static contact angle calculated from the
   force balance analysis on the bubble was consistent with the angles
   measured optically (71.3 degrees), which is in line with the published
   value (72 degrees). Using the sphere tensiometry method, the advancing
   and receding contact angles were measured to be 106 degrees and 45
   degrees, respectively. The detachment process was captured using a high
   speed camera operated at 1000 frames per second. The three phase contact
   on the left side of the bubble retracted as the contact angle in the
   upstream reached the advancing contact angle. However, the three phase
   contact on the right side of the bubble pinned on the surface of the
   particle as the contact angle in the downstream did not reach the
   receding contact angle. The dynamic contact angle of a bubble detaching
   from a particle was measured and it became asymmetric along the three
   phase contact line under the influence of a turbulent flow. (C) 2016

Title = {Multistable inflatable origami structures at the metre scale},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {592},
Number = {7855},

Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {From stadium covers to solar sails, we rely on deployability for the
   design of large-scale structures that can quickly compress to a fraction
   of their size(1-4). Historically, two main strategies have been used to
   design deployable systems. The first and most frequently used approach
   involves mechanisms comprising interconnected bar elements, which can
   synchronously expand and retract(5-7), occasionally locking in place
   through bistable elements(8,9). The second strategy makes use of
   inflatable membranes that morph into target shapes by means of a single
   pressure input(10-12). Neither strategy, however, can be readily used to
   provide an enclosed domain that is able to lock in place after
   deployment: the integration of a protective covering in linkage-based
   constructions is challenging and pneumatic systems require a constant
   applied pressure to keep their expanded shape(13-15). Here we draw
   inspiration from origami-the Japanese art of paper folding-to design
   rigid-walled deployable structures that are multistable and inflatable.
   Guided by geometric analyses and experiments, we create a library of
   bistable origami shapes that can be deployed through a single fluidic
   pressure input. We then combine these units to build functional
   structures at the metre scale, such as arches and emergency shelters,
   providing a direct route for building large-scale inflatable systems
   that lock in place after deployment and offer a robust enclosure through
   their stiff faces. Origami-inspired multistable structures that can be
   inflated from flat to three dimensions have been designed; a library of
   foldable shapes is created and then combined to build metre-scale
   functional structures.},

Abstract = {In rock drilling, as in many industries today, the drive towards
   unmanned equipment and full automation is a big issue. A challenge in
   the automation process for rock drilling is the retraction of the drill
   steels when the drilling is completed. Today the drilling can be
   performed automatically to some extend, but a human ear is required for
   the final part: when the splices between the drill steels are opened up
   enough to allow retraction.
   This paper discusses a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to search
   through audio data in order to detect and locate specific sounds
   appearing when retraction of the drill steels is possible, and to
   investigate if achieving full automation of the drilling process is
   possible. The use of Wavelets has also been evaluated. As far as the
   authors know, there is no system today for automatic retraction of the
   drill steels.
   By recording and analysing sounds from rock drill rigs, a comparison
   between a system implemented with an electronic car and a human ear has
   been evaluated. The FFT has been applied as a pre-processing method and
   examines features of power spectrum for the detection of the sound, when
   the splices are opened up. This sound contains higher power spectrum
   than sounds from the rest of the drilling procedure. Using these
   features, a classification program has been designed. The experimental
   results shows that there is a good possibility to make a commercialized
   product that automatically detect when the drill steels are ready to be
   retracted.},

Title = {A rare presentation of appendicitis inside the femoral canal: case
   report and literature review},
Journal = {SURGICAL CASE REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {BackgroundFemoral hernia accounts for 3\% of all the hernias, and in
   0.5-5\% of cases, the appendix can migrate through the femoral hernia
   and is called de Garengeot hernia. It is a very rare condition, and the
   incidence of appendicitis in this type of hernia is as low as
   0.08-0.13\%.Case presentationWe bring into discussion a case of a
   47-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a
   painful right-sided groin lump for the past 2days. After initial
   resuscitation, a CT scan was requested which showed the presence of
   inflamed appendix inside the femoral canal. She was taken to the
   operative theatre, and during the laparoscopy, the appendix was
   identified migrating through the femoral canal and it could not be
   retracted into the peritoneal cavity; therefore, the mesoappendix was
   divided and the operation converted to the open low approach. After
   identifying the femoral hernia sac and opening it, the appendix was
   removed and herniorrhaphy was performed. Our patient had an uneventful
   recovery and was discharged on the following day.ConclusionWe report a
   rare case of de Garengeot hernia which was diagnosed preoperatively.
   Because of its non-specific presentation, patients are usually diagnosed
   with incarcerated femoral hernia and are taken to operative theatre and
   the final diagnosis is made intra-operatively. Due to its rarity, there
   is no standard approach for this condition, and emergency appendicectomy
   and concurrent herniorrhaphy is the mainstay of treatment. In this
   paper, we present different surgical methods for the treatment of this
   type of hernia.},

Title = {Genetic algorithm for rigid body reconstruction after micro-Doppler
   removal in the radar imaging analysis},

Volume = {93},

Abstract = {Recently, an L-statistics based method for the micro-Doppler effects
   removal has been proposed by the authors. Order statistics is performed
   on the spectrogram, while the rigid body signal synthesis is done by
   using the remaining STFT samples, after micro-Doppler removal. By the
   proposed method, the Fourier transform is recovered with a concentration
   close to the original one. However, during the procedure of the
   micro-Doppler removal, the STFT samples that correspond to the rigid
   body are retracted, as well. Consequently, in the reconstructed Fourier
   transform of the rigid body, we get one very highly concentrated pulse,
   as in the original Fourier transform, and a number of low-concentrated
   components, being spread around the peak. These low concentrated
   components are summed up by different random phases. In this paper, we
   propose a genetic algorithm for the estimation of the removed STFT
   samples corresponding to the rigid body. Each individual in the genetic
   algorithm contains possible estimation of the phases of the missing STFT
   samples, whereas fitness function forces individuals (combination of
   phases) for which a minimal energy of the side lobs is obtained. The
   individual with the highest fitness is considered as the final phases'
   estimation of the missing STFT values, and then used for the
   reconstruction of the original Fourier transform. The amplitude of a
   STFT sample is estimated as median of the amplitudes of the remaining
   samples at the same frequency. Performance of the proposed genetic
   algorithm is illustrated by examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The structurally complex ankles of Triassic archosaurs (Reptilia:
   Diapsida) have been repeatedly described, and tarsal characters have
   played an important role in analyses of archosaur phylogeny.
   Morphological variations in the ankle joint undoubtedly had a major
   impact on locomotion, but the functional implications of many ankle
   features remain poorly understood. This paper investigates the function
   of one such structure, the prominent and highly distinctive lateral to
   posterolateral calcaneal process that occurs throughout basal archosaurs
   and is homologous to the heel-like calcaneal tuber of pseudosuchians. A
   morphologically analogous lateral process occurs in extant varanid
   lizards, and X-ray rotoscopic analysis of the limb movements of savannah
   monitors (Varanus exanthematicus) indicates that the lateral process
   rotates into a vertical orientation as the limb retracts. As the varanid
   lateral process approaches the vertical, it becomes increasingly
   effective in adding to the propulsive moment arm of m. peroneus longus.
   A computer model of the ankle was compared to modified versions in which
   the lateral process and the associated proximal expansion of the fifth
   metatarsal were eliminated, and this virtual experiment demonstrated
   that the combination of the two structures increases the peak propulsive
   moment arm of the varanid m. peroneus longus by over 26\%. The lateral
   calcaneal process of basal archosaurs probably acted similarly,
   enhancing the ability of the peroneus musculature to contribute to
   propulsion during walking. Like the calcaneal tuber of pseudosuchian
   archosaurs, the primitive lateral process was a lever that contributed
   to locomotion by allowing ankle plantarflexion to generate a greater
   propulsive moment.},

Title = {PARAMETRIZATION OF HEAD-SCATTER FACTORS FOR RECTANGULAR PHOTON FIELDS
   USING AN EQUIVALENT SQUARE FORMALISM},
Journal = {MEDICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1329-1332},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Head-scatter factors of symmetric square and rectangular fields (field
   center on the central beam axis) defined by the upper (Y) and lower (X)
   jaws for 6 and 15 MV photon beams from 2300CD and 600C accelerators
   (Varian Associates Inc., Pale Alto, CA) were measured, as well as those
   for fields shaped by the Y jaws and the multileaf collimator (MLC) of
   the 2300CD. For rectangular fields, the head-scatter factor for the
   field (x=a and y=b) was different from that for the field (y=a and x=b).
   This difference was 2\%-3\% for fields defined by conventional
   collimators when \textbackslash{}x-y\textbackslash{} was large, and
   became 4\%-5\% when the MLC and Y jaws were used to shape the fields
   with the X jaws retracted. In-order to calculate values for head-scatter
   factors of rectangular fields accurately using an equivalent square
   formalism, the side of the equivalent square should be obtained with
   different weights for lower and upper jaws, as proposed by Vadash and
   Bjarngard {[}Med. Phys. 20, 733-734 (1993)]. Our measurements
   demonstrate that the relative weight (C) of upper and lower jaws is
   strongly dependent on their distances from the x-ray source, while the
   beam energy has little effect on the value of G. We further show that G
   can be calculated simply from these distances. An analytical
   representation for head-scatter factors of square and rectangular fields
   is also developed in this paper. The quality of this representation was
   judged by the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from measured
   head-scatter factors, which ranged from O.11\%-0.27\%.},

Title = {A Scoping Review of Species Distribution Modeling Methods for Tick
   Vectors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Globally, tick-borne disease is a pervasive and worsening
   problem that impacts human and domestic animal health, livelihoods, and
   numerous economies. Species distribution models are useful tools to help
   address these issues, but many different modeling approaches and
   environmental data sources exist. Objective: We conducted a scoping
   review that examined all available research employing species
   distribution models to predict occurrence and map tick species to
   understand the diversity of model strategies, environmental predictors,
   tick data sources, frequency of climate projects of tick ranges, and
   types of model validation methods. Design: Following the PRISMA-ScR
   checklist, we searched scientific databases for eligible articles, their
   references, and explored related publications through a graphical tool
   (). Two independent reviewers performed article selection and
   characterization using a priori criteria. Results: We describe data
   collected from 107 peer-reviewed articles that met our inclusion
   criteria. The literature reflects that tick species distributions have
   been modeled predominantly in North America and Europe and have mostly
   modeled the habitat suitability for Ixodes ricinus (n = 23; 21.5\%). A
   wide range of bioclimatic databases and other environmental correlates
   were utilized among models, but the WorldClim database and its
   bioclimatic variables 1-19 appeared in 60 (56\%) papers. The most
   frequently chosen modeling approach was MaxEnt, which also appeared in
   60 (56\%) of papers. Despite the importance of ensemble modeling to
   reduce bias, only 23 papers (21.5\%) employed more than one algorithm,
   and just six (5.6\%) used an ensemble approach that incorporated at
   least five different modeling methods for comparison. Area under the
   curve/receiver operating characteristic was the most frequently reported
   model validation method, utilized in nearly all (98.9\%) included
   studies. Only 21\% of papers used future climate scenarios to predict
   tick range expansion or contraction. Regardless of the representative
   concentration pathway, six of seven genera were expected to both expand
   and retract depending on location, while Ornithodoros was predicted to
   only expand beyond its current range. Conclusion: Species distribution
   modeling techniques are useful and widely employed tools for predicting
   tick habitat suitability and range movement. However, the vast array of
   methods, data sources, and validation strategies within the SDM
   literature support the need for standardized protocols for species
   distribution and ecological niche modeling for tick vectors.},

Abstract = {Oce's VarioStream 9000 series of high-performance digital production
   printers features a non-contact fusing unit with unique properties. The
   printer's dual-engine architecture and simultaneous-duplex capability
   posed a challenge for the selection of the best suited fusing
   technology. Another challenge were the printer's changing paper movement
   modes due to its multi-pass operation. Monochrome printing runs with
   steady web motion, while dual, triple, and full-color print modes
   require the web to run, stop and retract in a multitude of fashions
   depending on the actual document content. The process speed must be
   adaptable to the requirements of light and heavy paper stock and special
   media.
   Traditional hot-roll fusing in combination with contact pre-heating was
   ruled out for the obvious reason of process incompatibility and high
   running cost. Contactless infrared fusing held the promise to meet the
   abovementioned challenges. Other pros were its durability, wide
   operating range, and low TCO figures. Shutter curtains allow for waste
   free printing in continuous and noncontinuous printing modes, even when
   the web starts and stops periodically every few seconds. A web cooling
   section effectively suppresses hot offset on drive rolls and blocking of
   printed material. While the printed web runs through hot and cold
   process sections the respective atmospheres are kept separate by means
   of support rollers. If required, these can be actively engaged to
   smoothen the surface of the soft toner image.
   Process control employs pre-set parameters in start-up situations and a
   bunch of non-contacting sensors for infrared power and web temperature
   control.
   The fusing unit is able to process papers from 40 g/m(2) to 160 g/m2
   with full speed (1 m/sec) and up to 240 g/m(2) with reduced speed.
   Toners with tailored rheological properties have been developed to
   achieve good balance between power consumption, process time, and web
   dehydration. The fusing process delivers excellent toner adhesion and
   crease resistance for a wide range of media.
   This paper also gives a breakdown of the physics involved in design and
   operation of the fusing system. Radiator types, print media, toner
   properties, and heat transfer are discussed. Engineering aspects like
   shutter movement, power control, safety concept round off the picture.},

Title = {The use of palatal implants for orthodontic anchorage - Design and

Journal = {CLINICAL ORAL IMPLANTS RESEARCH},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {410-416},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper presents the Orthosystem (Institute Straumann,
   Waldenburg/Switzerland), a new endosseous orthodontic implant anchor
   system for palatal anchorage. The Orthosystem may replace compliance
   dependent extraoral anchoring aids for orthodontics and makes a bonding
   of well aligned mandibular dentition and it's use with class II elastics
   unnecessary. The fixture is designed for a one-stage application. It
   consists of an implant of pure titanium with a surface-treated,
   screw-shaped endosseous part of 3.3 mm diameter and lengths of 4 and 6
   mm. Above the polished transmucosal neck follows an abutment where
   transpalatal, arches made of rigid orthodontic wires (0.032x0.032 inch)
   are fixed by means of a clamp-cap. 6 patients with an angle class II
   malocclusion were implanted with the 6 mm fixture in the proximal
   midsagittal region of the palate during a pilot study. The treatment
   goal was extraction of the first maxillary premolars with subsequent
   retraction of the frontal dentition under maximal anchorage of the
   lateral teeth. For the implantation a simple surgical procedure of 10
   min length was required while no further invasive actions an needed
   until explantation. This way the strain on the patients was reduced to a
   minimum. They are now at varying stages of active treatment and the most
   advanced case is demonstrated here, The clinical and radiological
   findings after 12 months of treatment comprising 3 months of healing
   revealed no implant mobility or dislocation, favourable periimplant soft
   tissue conditions, and no marked mesial movement of the implant
   supported teeth. The frontal dentition was retracted by 8 mm with space
   closure occurring in a relatively short treatment period.},

Title = {An intelligent shopping support robot: understanding shopping behavior
   from 2D skeleton data using GRU network},
Journal = {ROBOMECH JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In supermarkets or grocery, a shopping cart is a necessary tool for
   shopping. In this paper, we have developed an intelligent shopping
   support robot that can carry a shopping cart while following its owners
   and provide the shopping support by observing the customer's head
   orientation, body orientation and recognizing different shopping
   behaviors. Recognizing shopping behavior or the intensity of such action
   is important for understanding the best way to support the customer
   without disturbing him or her. This system also liberates elderly and
   disabled people from the burden of pushing shopping carts, because our
   proposed shopping cart is essentially a type of autonomous mobile robots
   that recognizes its owner and following him or her. The proposed system
   discretizes the head and body orientation of customer into 8 directions
   to estimate whether the customer is looking or turning towards a
   merchandise shelf. From the robot's video stream, a DNN-based human pose
   estimator called OpenPose is used to extract the skeleton of 18 joints
   for each detected body. Using this extracted body joints information, we
   built a dataset and developed a novel Gated Recurrent Neural Network
   (GRU) topology to classify different actions that are typically
   performed in front of shelves: reach to shelf, retract from shelf, hand
   in shelf, inspect product, inspect shelf. Our GRU network model takes
   series of 32 frames skeleton data then gives the prediction. Using
   cross-validation tests, our model achieves an overall accuracy of 82\%,
   which is a significant result. Finally, from the customer's head
   orientation, body orientation and shopping behavior recognition we
   develop a complete system for our shopping support robot.},

Abstract = {Background: Optomap uses the ultra-wide field scanning laser
   ophthalmoscopy to provide retinal examination. It permits fundus
   examination without the use of a mydriatic, which is more comfortable
   for the patients. This paper determines the sensitivity and specificity
   of the Optomap for detecting retinal signs under non-mydriatic
   conditions.
   Methods: Fifty-four eyes identified with retinal/choroidal signs and
   eight normal eyes were recruited from 31 Hong Kong Chinese subjects.
   Photo-documentation of fundal changes was obtained with the Optomap
   under non-mydriatic conditions before a dilated fundus examination by a
   clinician using standard procedures. The eyelid was retracted using a
   cotton bud when necessary. Dilated fundus examinations were performed by
   another clinician using binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy and slitlamp
   biomicroscopy with a fundus lens. The Optomap images were evaluated by
   four other investigators under masked condition. The International
   Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9-CM) was adopted for
   recording retinal features. Screening results were compared with those
   obtained using the dilated fundus examination as the gold standard.
   Results: The cotton bud method for eyelid retraction showed an
   improvement in the area of retina that could be visualised. The
   sensitivity and specificity of the Optomap averaged 76.4 and 71.9 per
   cent, respectively. Some fundal signs were missed by all observers in
   the Optomap but not with the biomicroscope. These included
   white-without-pressure, lattice degeneration, paramacular drusen and
   pigmentary changes at central fundus.
   Conclusion: Optomap serves as a reliable screening tool for fundus
   examination especially because it covers a much wider area of the
   peripheral retina than other digital instruments for fundus photography.},

Abstract = {The droplet/wall interaction in the gas channel (GC) of proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has significant influence on water
   management, which may affect the performance and durability of the cell.
   In this paper, a coupled level-set and volume-of fluid (CLSVOF) method
   is used to simulate the dynamic behaviours of a micro-droplet impacting
   on a vertical wall in the GC. The effects of impact velocity (expressed
   by the Weber number, We), and impact angle on the spreading dynamics are
   evaluated. Next, the critical conditions for the transition from
   spreading to rebound are further discussed. For 0 < We <80, only the
   spreading, retracting, and rebound are observed, and the phenomenon of
   air bubble entrapment is captured on different wettable walls. With an
   increment of We, the maximum total spreading factor l{*} tot and
   corresponding normalised time t{*} will increase, as well as the
   normalised time difference DT2 between the maximum spreading length and
   minimum height. Moreover, when increasing the impact angle, the maximum
   front spreading factor depending on the tangential velocity component
   will decrease, while the absolute value of maximum back spreading factor
   squeezed by the normal velocity component will increase. For the oblique
   downward impact, the front liquid led by the tangential velocity
   component plays a more important role in dominating the spreading
   process. The results also indicate that both the wall wettability and We
   can affect the transition threshold. When the static contact angle is
   between 90 degrees and 150 degrees, the effect of We on the rebound is
   inversely proportional to the hydrophobicity of the wall. (C) 2021

Abstract = {The quality of feeding, understood as a nutrition founded on quality
   foods and on the varied and balanced contribution in the diet of an
   adequate level of nutrients, fibers, vitamins and minerals (low in fat
   and sugars), is one of the pillars on which a society should establish
   strategies for keeping in time and space its well-being.
   The focus on the quality of feeding, however, is susceptible to a double
   approach: individual and collective. The individual approach, confining
   attention to the quality of feeding to the type of lifestyle that
   everyone follows, delimits the relative costs and responsibilities to a
   personal scope. The collective approach would instead returns the
   quality in the context of the externalities of a socio-economic and
   environmental process to be managed with appropriate forms of
   governance, able to extend the responsibility ``over the person{''} and
   redetermine the development and the distribution of the costs of quality
   of feeding. In this second case, a healthy lifestyle becomes the result
   of a process of promotion and guidance aimed to nest sustainable
   behaviours and to activate virtuous circles on the base of which
   lifestyles then, in turn, may become the key to the sustainability of
   wellbeing in certain territories.
   In view of this, the present paper aims to highlight the key role of
   quality of feeding as a determinant of the sustainability of the
   well-being and solicit the attention of policy makers on the need to
   implement appropriate governance strategies able to retract obvious
   market distortions through the support and promotion of healthy and
   natural lifestyles. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Genetic optimism: Framing genes and mental illness in the news},
Journal = {CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {225-247},
Abstract = {Over the past two decades the pace and specificity of discoveries
   associating genetics with mental illness has accelerated, which is
   reflected in an increase in news coverage about the genetics of mental
   disorder. The news media is a major source of public understanding of
   genetics and a strong influence on public discourse. This paper examines
   the news coverage of genetics and mental illness (i.e., bipolar illness
   and schizophrenia) over a 25 year period, emphasizing the peak period of
   1987-1994. Using a sample of 110 news stories from 5 major American
   newspapers and 3 news magazines, we identify the frame of ``genetic
   optimism'' which dominated the reporting of genetics and mental illness
   beginning in the mid-1980s. The structure of the frame is comprised of 3
   elements: a gene for the disorder exists; it will be found; and it will
   be good. New discoveries of genes were announced with great fanfare, but
   the most promising claims could not be replicated or were retracted in
   short order. Despite these disconfirmations, genetic optimism persisted
   in subsequent news stories. While the scientific accuracy of the gene
   stories is high, the genetic optimism frame distorts some of the
   findings, misrepresents and reifies the impact of genes on mental
   disorder, and leaves no space for critics or an examination of potential
   negative impacts. The stances of reporters, scientists and editors may
   all in different ways contribute to the perpetuation of genetic
   optimism. Genetic optimism presents an overly sanguine picture of the
   state of genetics; as we enter the genetic age it is important to
   balance the extraneous ``hype and hope'' contained in news stories of
   genetics and mental illness.},

Title = {Development and Application of Standard Device for Calibrating Steel
   Measuring Tape Based on Machine Vision},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Featured Application A standard device of steel measuring tape based on
   machine vision is used for the intelligent detection of steel measuring
   tape, with accurate, fast, and automatic characteristics. The
   application of this device falls within the scope of metrology. Aiming
   to address the disadvantages of the low automation degree of the
   traditional steel measuring tape verification device, as well as the
   high labor intensity of metrologists, high time costs, and low
   measurement accuracy, this paper develops a new automatic steel
   measuring tape calibration device based on machine vision technology. In
   this study, the key components, such as the tape-winding mechanism,
   machine vision system, force measuring device, and tape-retracting
   device, were designed. Three different scribed line identification and
   location algorithms, processing the longest line, the closest to the
   starting line, the highest line, etc., were designed to adapt to
   different types of steel measuring tape. Lastly, indication error and
   measurement repeatability tests were carried out. The results showed
   that the standard device can carry out the verification and calibration
   of steel measuring tape, and the maximum repeatability of the indication
   error of the test objects was 0.025 mm, 0.038 mm, and 0.030 mm,
   respectively, and the indication error of each object was within the
   allowable error limits. The uncertainty evaluation of the indication
   error of each test object was 0.16 mm, 0.54 mm, 0.78 mm, which was not
   more than one third of the maximum permissible error value. Hence, the
   measuring principle, method, and procedure of the calibration device are
   shown to be scientific and feasible.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background/objectivesTo derive dietary patterns and examine their
   longitudinal associations with sociodemographic and lifestyle factors in
   the Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort.Subjects/methodsThis is a corrected
   analysis of a retracted paper. We followed 1098 adults aged >= 50 years
   for 5 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food
   frequency questionnaire. Baseline dietary patterns were identified using
   exploratory factor analysis and scores at each time point calculated
   using the weighted sum score method. Associations of energy-adjusted
   dietary pattern scores with participant characteristics were assessed
   using linear mixed-effects models.ResultsThe four dietary patterns
   identified were: fruit and vegetable (vegetables, potatoes, fruits);
   animal protein (poultry, red meats, fish); snack (snacks, sweets, nuts);
   western (meat pies, hamburgers, pizzas). Fruit and vegetable pattern
   scores were lower in men and current smokers at baseline. Animal protein
   scores were lower in older and retired people but higher in men and
   smokers at baseline. The sex difference in animal protein score
   increased over time (p=0.012). At baseline, snack score was positively
   associated with age and physical activity, but lower in men and current
   smokers. The effect of age on snack score lessened over time (p=0.035).
   Western scores were lower in older people but higher in men, current
   smokers and those living in disadvantaged areas at baseline. The effect
   of age on western score reduced over time (p=0.001).ConclusionsThe
   higher scores for healthy and/or lower scores for unhealthy patterns in
   men, smokers, retirees and those experiencing social disadvantage
   suggest these could be target groups for interventions to improve diet
   quality in older adults.},

Title = {ATR vowel harmony in Ateso},
Journal = {STELLENBOSCH PAPERS IN LINGUISTICS PLUS-SPIL PLUS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {54},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {61-69},
Abstract = {Vowels in Ateso, an Eastern Nilotic language, are subject to Advanced
   Tongue Root (ATR) harmony. Accordingly, the vowels are divided into two
   harmony sets which differ in terms of tongue root position. The two sets
   of tongue root position are the Advanced Tongue Root {[}+ATR] set and
   the Retracted Tongue Root {[}-ATR] set. Comparably, Bari and Lutuko,
   related Eastern Nilotic languages, have a ten-vowel system consisting of
   five closed and five open vowels, with clearly discernible laws of ATR
   vowel harmony (Tucker \& Bryan 1966: 444). A similar system applies to
   Ateso which has the following nine phonemic vowels: /i e u o a/ and the
   phonetic vowel {[}a]. The presence of the {[}a] variant is conditioned
   by neighbouring {[}+ATR] vowels or glides, and hence does not have
   phonemic status; instead, it is treated as an allophone of /a/. In this
   paper, I follow the general discussion of vowel harmony in African
   languages (e.g. by Casali (2003, 2008)), albeit in Ateso. Firstly, I
   introduce the Ateso vowel articulatory parameters and the phonetic
   realisation of /a/. Secondly, I show that in Ateso /a/ behaves like an
   underlying {[}-ATR] vowel and that, generally, though the ATR affects
   tongue height and thereby accounts for the relative tongue height, ATR
   is not a category of tongue height but rather of the position of the
   tongue root. Lastly, I demonstrate that Ateso ATR vowel harmony has two
   dimensions. One is the condition that vowels ideally belong to a
   {[}-ATR] or {[}-FATR] set within a word and the second is that there is
   a dynamic dimension where ATR qualities may change as a result of
   affixation.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the stability of the Cassie state of wetting in
   transparent superhydrophobic coatings by comparing a single-layer
   microporous coating with a double-layer micro/nanoporous coating.
   Increasing pressure resistance of superhydrophobic coatings is of
   interest for practical use because high external pressures may be
   exerted on surfaces during operation. The Cassie state stability against
   the external pressure of coatings was investigated by squeezing droplets
   sitting on surfaces with a hydrophobic plate. Droplets on the
   single-layer coating transformed to the Wenzel state and pinned to the
   surface after squeezing, whereas droplets on the double-layer
   micro/nanoporous coating preserved the Cassie state and rolled off the
   surface easily. In addition, the contact angle and contact-line diameter
   of water droplets during evaporation from surfaces were in situ
   investigated to further understand the stability of coatings against
   Wenzel transition. A droplet on a microporous coating gradually
   transformed to the Wenzel state and lost its spherical shape as the
   droplet volume decreased (i.e., the internal pressure of the droplet
   increased). The contact line of the droplet during evaporation remained
   almost unchanged. In contrast, a water droplet on a double-layer surface
   preserved its spherical shape even at the last stages of the evaporation
   process, where pressure differences as high as a few thousand pascals
   were generated. For this case, the droplet contact line retracted during
   evaporation and the droplet recovered the initial water contact angle.
   The demonstrated method for the preparation of robust transparent
   superhydrophobic coatings is promising for outdoor applications such as
   self-cleaning cover glasses for solar cells and nonwetting windows.},

Abstract = {This paper reports an investigation of asynchronous flow marks on the
   surface of injection molded parts and short shots made from two
   different blends of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene random
   copolymer elastomers. Flow marks were observed on the surface with both
   blends; the spatial frequency of flow marks on the surface was greater
   in the blend B1, which also exhibited a greater contrast between the
   surface regions. The same blend was distinctly faster in the linear
   viscoelastic tests of shear creep recovery and shear viscosity growth.
   The degree of contrast between the flow-mark regions and the
   out-of-flow-mark regions was examined with a detailed analysis of SEM
   micrographs of the surface regions as well as the near wall regions from
   short shots. This revealed that the dispersed phase was highly stretched
   to cylindrical strands in the glossy surface regions of both blends and
   retracted in the dull regions to different extents in the two cases. A
   comparison of the particle size distributions and aspect ratio
   distributions in different regions established that rapid retraction of
   the suspended elastomer phase was the dominant cause of changes in
   particle shape between surface regions. Nonlinear shear creep and creep
   recovery curves of the two elastomer components showed that at a time of
   1 s, the fractional strain recovery of the elastomer in B1 was much
   higher than that of the elastomer in B2. Hence, the nonlinear elastic
   recovery of the elastomer phase at short times is an important factor in
   flow mark formation with blends of polypropylene and olefinic
   elastomers. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {When following a negated matrix clause, adverbial clauses (ACs) like
   ``because it was paid very well{''} in (1) can be interpreted as
   residing within the scope of the negation (1b), or outside of it (1).
   (1) a. Peter did not quit his job because it was paid very well b. Peter
   did not quit his job because it was paid very badly.
   Depending on the scope of the negative, the interpretation differs
   dramatically: Whereas Peter did in fact not quit his job in (1a), he did
   so in (1b), but for yet unknown reasons. It has been shown for English
   (see Frazier \& Clifton, 1996), that there is a preference to interpret
   the adverbial clause outside of the scope of the negation so that (1b)
   appears fairly odd. This observation challenges recency based processing
   principles, such as late closure, since the high attachment (to IP)
   appears to be preferred over low attachment (to VP) (see figure 1). In
   this paper, we will present evidence on German equivalents of (1a, b),
   varying the order of the negative and the verb (Experiment I), the
   context in which the ambiguity appears (Experiment II), and the position
   of the adverbial in relation to the clause boundary where the negation
   of the main verb is restricted or even retracted (Experiment III). None
   of these variations reduced the preference substantially. Only an
   explicit alternative cause reduced it but even this variation did not
   eliminate the difficulty of the inside scope interpretation. We will
   argue that incremental interpretation as well as immediate attribution
   of prosodic structure determine the interpretation of the adverbial
   clause.},

Abstract = {Feedback to students' writing plays an important role as a scaffolding
   technique to help the students to improve their writing skills. With the
   introduction of school-based assessment and the Common European
   Framework of Reference (CEFR) into the new Standards-based English
   Language Curriculum (SBELC), teachers are expected to adapt the process
   writing approach in their classroom, where feedback is at the core of
   the process writing approach. This present study aims to explore
   Malaysian ESL teachers' practice of written feedback in their writing
   classrooms. Two sample essays were used in this study. The sample essays
   were written by a Form Three student of a secondary school in Kuantan,
   Pahang, and a Form Five student from a secondary school in Manjung,
   Perak.The sample essays were sent to all secondary schools in Pahang,
   and teachers who teach the English Language at the schools were asked to
   mark the essay as how they would normally mark their students' essays.
   The participants of this study were selected using purposive sampling. A
   total of 89 student sample essays with the teachers' marking were
   returned, and the teachers' feedback were analysed. This study found
   that most of the participants mark their students' essays
   comprehensively and implicitly. However, some of the respondents did not
   give any feedback at all, and even if they did, the feedback would be
   retracted from the marking rubric. It has also been found that the
   respondents of this present study did not utilise comments on goals to
   work towards or specific activities for improvement. This paper further
   discusses the findings in view of the assessment of learning (AfL) and
   gives recommendations for future practice.},

Title = {Nutritional supplements and infection in the elderly: why do the
   findings conflict?},
Journal = {NUTRITION JOURNAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {5},
Abstract = {Background: Most of the randomized placebo-controlled trials that have
   examined the clinical effects of multivitamin-mineral supplements on
   infection in the elderly have shown no significant effect. The
   exceptions are three such trials, all using a supplement with the same
   composition, and all claiming dramatic benefits: a frequently cited
   study published in 1992, which reported a 50\% reduction in the number
   of days of infection (NDI), and two 2002 replication studies. Questions
   have been raised about the 1992 report; a second report in 2001 based on
   the same trial, but describing effects of the supplement on cognitive
   functions, has been retracted by Nutrition. The primary purpose of the
   present paper is to evaluate the claims about the effects of supplements
   on NDI in the two replication reports.
   Methods: Examination of internal consistency (outcomes of statistical
   tests versus reported data); comparison of variability of NDI across
   individuals in these two reports with variability in other trials;
   estimation of the probability of achieving the reported close agreement
   with the original finding.
   Results: The standard deviations of NDI and levels of statistical
   significance reported are profoundly inconsistent. The reported standard
   deviations of NDI are consistently below what other studies have found.
   The reported percent reductions in NDI agree too closely with the
   original study.
   Conclusion: The claims of reduced NDI in the two replication reports
   should be questioned, which also adds to concerns about the 1992 study.
   It follows that there is currently no trustworthy evidence from
   randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that favors the use of
   vitamin-mineral supplements to reduce infection in the elderly.},

Abstract = {This paper describes an experimental investigation of the use of Gurney
   flaps to control laminar separation on turbine blades in a linear
   cascade. Measurements were made at Reynolds numbers (based upon inlet
   velocity and axial chord) of 28 X 10(3), 65 x 10(3) and 167 x 10(3). The
   freestream turbulence intensity for all three cases was 0.8\%. Laminar
   separation was present on the suction surface of the Langston blade
   shape for the two lower Reynolds numbers. In (in effort to control the
   laminar separation, Gurney flaps were added to the pressure surface
   close to the trailing edge. The measurements indicate that the flaps
   turn and accelerate the flow in the blade, passage toward the suction
   suffice of the neighboring blade thereby eliminating the separation
   bubble. Five different sizes of Gurney flaps, ranging from 0.6 to 2.7\%
   of axial chord, were tested. The laser thermal tuft technique was used
   to determine the influence of the Gurney flaps on the location and size
   of the separation bubble. Additionally, measurements of wall static
   pressure, profile loss, and blade-exit flow angle were made. The blade
   pressure distribution indicates that the lift generated by the blade is
   increased. As was expected, the Gurney flap also produced a larger wake.
   In practice, Gurney flaps might possibly be implemented in a
   semi-passive manner They could be deployed for low Reynolds number
   operation and then retracted at high Reynolds numbers when separation is
   not present. This work is important because it describes a successful
   means for eliminating the separation bubble while characterizing both
   the potential performance improvement and the penalties associated with
   this semi-passive flow control technique.},

Abstract = {Cold metal transfer (CMT) is a novel technique of joining, which is an
   improvised version of the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) techniques, in
   which the wire of the filler metal is deliberately pulled backwards
   after the short circuit. The retracted wire aids the disengagement of
   droplets during the short circuit, thereby transferring the metal into
   the pool of molten without the support of electromagnetic force. Due to
   this, the input of heat is greatly reduced and spatter is eliminated to
   greater extent. Lower volume of heat makes the technique of CMT welding
   a more ideal one for joining thin sheets and plates. Employment of CMT
   welding technique curtails spatter, distortion of joints and also
   requires limited clean up. CMT have made it possible to join together Al
   and steel. In addition to this, in this technique, the length of the arc
   can be monitored and can be controlled easily through mechanical means.
   Therefore, the stability of the arc is perfect, irrespective of the
   surface to be joined and during faster rate of joining, thereby making
   it possible to employ the technique of CMT welding in all position and
   for any application. This paper reviews in brief, the history,
   applications and principle of operation of the CMT welding technique. In
   addition to these, the several types of recently evolved types of CMT
   welding tech-niques namely CMT pulse advanced, CMT advanced, CMT + P,
   CMT Dynamic and the research findings of several relevant experimental
   works were discussed in brief. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Experimental and CFD study of slotted Krueger flaps aerodynamics in

Abstract = {Purpose
   Some recent effort showed that usage of Krueger flaps helps to maintain
   laminar flow in cruise flight. Such flaps are positioned higher relative
   to the chord to shield the leading edge from the insect contamination
   during take-off. The flap passes several through critical intermediate
   position during the deployment to its design position. The purpose of
   this paper is to analyse the aerodynamics.
   Design/methodology/approach
   To better understand such flow phenomena, the combined approach of
   computational fluid dynamics and experimental methods were used. Flow
   simulation was performed with in-house finite volume Navier-Stokes
   solver in fully turbulent unsteady RANS regime. The experimental data
   were obtained by means of force and pressure measurements and some areas
   of the flow field were examined with 2 C particle image velocimetry.
   Findings
   The airfoil with flap in critical position has a very limited maximum
   lift coefficient. The maximum achievable lift coefficient during the
   deployment is significantly affected by the vertical position of the
   trailing edge of the flap. The most unfavourable position during the
   deployment is not the flap perpendicular to the chord, but the flap
   inclined closer to it is the retracted position.
   Research limitations/implications - The flap movement was not simulated
   either in the simulation or in the experiment. Only intermediate static
   positions were examined.
   Practical implications - A better understanding of aerodynamic phenomena
   connected with the deployment of a Krueger flap can contribute to the
   simpler and lighter of kinematics and also to decrease time-to-market.
   Originality/value
   Limited experimental and computational results of Krueger flap in
   critical positions during the deployment are published in the
   literature.},

Abstract = {With the development of optoelectronic imaging technology, remote
   sensing optical system gradually develops towards super large imaging
   field of view in order to obtain target characteristic information in a
   wider space. Concentric multiscale system is a new type of large field
   of view optical system. At present, most of the schemes studied are
   multiscale system based on concentric spherical lens. Due to the
   limitation of optical materials, this optical system is generally only
   used in visible and near infrared optical bands, and is difficult to be
   applied in long-wave infrared band. Starting from the structure
   principle of concentric multi-scale system and considering the
   application of long-wave infrared band, this paper proposes to use
   spherical reflector instead of concentric spherical lens to construct a
   retracted multi-scale system based on spherical reflector. The system
   can achieve all the features of multi-scale system and can be applied in
   the infrared band. According to the construction principle of the system
   and the design idea of off-axis deviation field, a multi-scale system
   based on spherical reflector is designed. The main parameters of the
   single channel of the system are: the focal length is 72mm, the system
   F\#=2, the working band is 8-12um, and the imaging field of view is 20
   degrees x0.1 degrees. The imaging quality of the system is close to the
   diffraction limit in the full field of view, and the distortion of the
   full field of view is less than 5\%. The circular field of view imaging
   of 360 degrees x0.1 degrees can be achieved by extending the spherical
   reflector and multi-channel splicing.},

Title = {The radio signature of twisted magnetic ropes and reconnection site in

Abstract = {A solar radio burst on 25 August 1999 with fine structures (FS) at 4.5 -
   7.5 GHz is studied in this paper. The FS started about one minute prior
   to the main burst. The maximum emission took place at 4 - 5 GHz for the
   FS, and at 10 - 11 GHz for the main burst, respectively. The time
   profiles at 4.5 - 7.5 GHz coincide very well with those of hard X-rays (
   from 25 keV to > 300 keV) in both the main burst and the FS, which shows
   that the same population of accelerated electrons is responsible for
   both the microwave and hard X-ray bursts. The source of FS is 20 arc sec
   away from the main source close to a compact dipolar magnetic field,
   which is confirmed by different time and polarization profiles in the FS
   and main sources. It is interesting that the FS at 4.5 - 7.5 GHz are
   associated with a series of twisted magnetic loops or ropes, which may
   be modulated by Alfven waves with a period of 1 s and a spatial
   wavelength of 10(3) km in respect to the typical Alfven velocity of
   10(3) km s(-1) in corona. These magnetic ropes may be rooted in the
   dipole site, which extended into the corona during the event and
   retracted after the event. Therefore, the FS in this event may show an
   important signature or precursor for energy release. The magnetic
   reconnection may be triggered by the interaction of the magnetic ropes
   at the height corresponding to 5 - 6 GHz, followed by cascaded energy
   release close to the foot-point of the magnetic ropes.},

Title = {Atmospheric pressure as a force that fills developing bones with marrow

Journal = {MEDICAL HYPOTHESES},

Abstract = {Many theories try to explain the existence and function of paranasal
   sinuses. This paper is an attempt to correlate process of paranasal
   sinus development in human with bone pneumatization processes in
   animals.
   It is here proposed that this mechanism starts in utero and continues
   after birth. During endochondral development, a solid hyaline cartilage
   model transforms into long bones. Central chondrocytes hypertrophy and
   their lacunae become confluent. Dissolving of the cartilage
   intercellular matrix forms a primitive marrow cavity. It is soon invaded
   by the periostal bud. Once circulation is established in the developing
   bone, the dissolved hyaline matrix can be slowly washed away from the
   bone cavity. Circulation in the bone cavity can develop slight
   subatmospheric pressures, similar to negative interstitial pressures in
   subcutaneous tissues. The amniotic fluid conducts atmospheric pressure
   to the fetal body. The pressure is trying to fill enlarging bone
   cavities through the existing vascular openings, or to create new
   openings. Bone walls of developing paranasal bones are to weak to resist
   the pressure gradient on their walls. New openings form on the weakest
   spots allowing airway mucosa to form initial paranasal sinuses.
   The enlarging cavities of long bones that are remote from the body
   surface and airway also develop a slightly subatmospheric pressure that
   fills them with cellular elements. These elements enter bone through the
   feeding vessels and form bone marrow.
   During after birth skeletal growth, bone remodeling shapes paranasal
   sinuses in a process of slow evolution that do not require measurable
   pressure gradients. When two sinuses come in vicinity, their growth rate
   declines, since the remaining thin and fragile bone lamella between them
   does not retract anymore. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Flight vehicles are often designed to function around a primary
   operating point such as an efficient cruise or a high maneuverability
   mode. Performance and efficiency deteriorate rapidly as the airplane
   moves towards other portions of the flight envelope. One solution to
   this quandary is to radically change the shape of the aircraft. This
   yields both improved efficiency and a larger flight envelope. This
   global shape change is an example of morphing aircraft. One concept of
   morphing is the span morphing wing in which the wingspan is varied to
   accommodate multiple flight regimes. This type of design allows for at
   least two discreet modes of the aircraft. The original configuration, in
   which the extensible portion of the wing is fully retracted, yields a
   high speed dash mode. Fully extending the wing provides the aircraft
   with a low speed mode tailored for fine tracking and loiter tasks.
   This paper discusses the design of a span morphing wing that permits a
   change in the aspect ratio while simultaneously supporting structural
   wing loads. The wing cross section is maintained by NACA 4412 rib
   sections. The span morphing wing was investigated in different
   configurations. The wing area and the aspect ratio of the span morphing
   wing increase as the wings pan increases. Computational aerodynamics are
   used to estimate the performance and dynamic characteristics of each
   wing shape of this span morphing wing as its wingspan is changed.
   Results show that in order to obtain the same lift, the conventional
   wing requires a larger angle of attach(AOA) than that of the span
   morphing wing.The lift of the span morphing wing increases as the wing
   span,Mach number and AOA increases.},

Abstract = {A subgraph H of a graph G is isometric if the distance between any pair
   of vertices in H is the same as that in G. A subset K of the vertex set
   of a graph G is (geodesically) convex if it contains all vertices of
   every shortest path joining vertices in K. In this paper we investigate
   some properties of the isometric subgraphs of an infinite bridged graph
   G containing no infinite simplices (i.e., complete subgraphs), and in
   particular of those: whose vertex sets are convex in G. We prove that
   every finite set of vertices of G is contained in a finite isometric
   subgraph of G. Several results highlight the important role played by
   the dominated vertices of G (a vertex x is dominated by a vertex y if y
   is adjacent, to x and to all neighbors of x). In particular we show that
   G is finite whenever the set D(G) of its dominated vertices is finite.
   If, however, every ray of G contains an infinite bounded subset, then:
   V(G) is the convex hull of D(G). From this, we deduce that for every
   convex set K in G, there is an enumeration (x(alpha))(alpha<sigma) of
   the vertices of G - K such that, for every alpha < \&sigma;, x(\&alpha;)
   is dominated in the subgraph of G induced by \{x(\&beta;): \&alpha;
   \&LE; \&beta; \&LT; \&sigma;\} U K. Finally, if, in addition, G is
   bounded, then every subgraph whose vertex set is convex in G is a
   (discrete) deformation retract of G. \&COPY; 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {H alpha ACTIVITY OF OLD M DWARFS: STELLAR CYCLES AND MEAN ACTIVITY

Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Through the McDonald Observatory M Dwarf Planet Search, we have acquired
   nearly 3000 high-resolution spectra of 93 late-type (K5-M5) stars over
   more than a decade using the High Resolution Spectrograph on the
   Hobby-Eberly Telescope. This sample provides a unique opportunity to
   investigate the occurrence of long-term stellar activity cycles for
   low-mass stars. In this paper, we examine the stellar activity of our
   targets as reflected in the H alpha feature. We have identified periodic
   signals for six stars, with periods ranging from days to more than 10
   years, and find long-term trends for seven others. Stellar cycles with P
   >= 1 year are present for at least 5\% of our targets. Additionally, we
   present an analysis of the time-averaged activity levels of our sample,
   and search for correlations with other stellar properties. In
   particular, we find that more massive, earlier type (M0-M2) stars tend
   to be more active than later type dwarfs. Furthermore, high-metallicity
   stars tend to be more active at a given stellar mass. We also evaluate H
   alpha variability as a tracer of activity-induced radial velocity (RV)
   variation. For the M dwarf GJ 1170, H alpha variation reveals stellar
   activity patterns matching those seen in the RVs, mimicking the signal
   of a giant planet, and we find evidence that the previously identified
   stellar activity cycle of GJ 581 may be responsible for the recently
   retracted planet f in that system. In general, though, we find that H
   alpha is not frequently correlated with RV at the precision (typically
   6-7 m s(-1)) of our measurements.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe the flight characteristics of a swift (Apus
   apus) in cruising flight at three different flight speeds (8.0, 8.4 and
   9.2 m s(-1)) in a low turbulence wind tunnel. The wingbeat kinematics
   were recorded by high-speed filming and the wake of the bird was
   visualized by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Certain flight
   characteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied
   species. As the flight speed increases, the angular velocity of the
   wingbeat remains constant, and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases,
   the frequency decreases accordingly, as though the flight muscles were
   contracting at a fixed rate. The wings are also comparatively inflexible
   and are flexed or retracted rather little during the upstroke. The
   upstroke is always aerodynamically active and this is reflected in the
   wake, where shedding of spanwise vorticity occurs throughout the
   wingbeat. Although the wake superficially resembles those of other birds
   in cruising flight, with a pair of trailing wingtip vortices connected
   by spanwise vortices, the continuous shedding of first positive
   vorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during the
   upstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and
   then decreasing during the wingbeat cycle. The wake ( and implied wing
   aerodynamics) are not well described by discrete vortex loop models, but
   a new wake-based model, where incremental spanwise and streamwise
   variations of the wake impulse are integrated over the wingbeat, shows
   good agreement of the vertical momentum flux with the required weight
   support. The total drag was also estimated from the wake alone, and the
   calculated lift: drag ratio of approximately 13 for flapping flight is
   the highest measured yet for birds.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear high-efficiency model predictive control
   (NHMPC) with constraints designed for the test mass (TM) capture phase
   of the drag-free satellite about gravitational wave observatory. To
   avoid collisions between test mass and satellite cavity, TM capture is
   the essential technology for drag-free satellite. Test mass is located
   inside an electrostatic suspension and locked by a clamp mechanism
   initially. The test masses are released with high initial offsets and
   velocities when the mechanism is retracted. The purpose of this phase is
   to guarantee the TM to be positioned at the cage center and attitude
   aligned with the local cage frame. Due to the low actuation authority of
   electrostatic suspension along with critical initial offsets and
   velocities, it is a challenging task to design the attitude and
   translation control schemes with simultaneous consideration of system
   performance and energy consumption. For the problem given above, the TM
   capture can be reformulated into a nonlinear quadratic optimal control
   problem with the state and input constraints. A nonlinear model
   predictive control (NMPC) structure is also designed to handle the
   noises by forming a closed loop. This control framework can realize
   optimality and robustness in a compromise. To improve the speed of
   solving high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control online for MPC, the
   indirect Chebyshev pseudospectral method with constraints is employed.
   The convergence and stability of the control loop are analyzed.
   Simulation examples show that the feasibility and perfor-mance of the
   designed control loop are verified compared with the existing methods
   and computation times in the millisecond range can be achieved.\& COPY;

Title = {Disasters and Investment: Assessing the Performance of the Underlying
   Economy Following a Large-Scale Stimulus in the Built Environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Disasters are often followed by a large-scale stimulus supporting the
   economy through the built environment, which can last years. During this
   time, official economic indicators tend to suggest the economy is doing
   well, but as activity winds down, the sentiment can quickly change. In
   response to the damaging 2011 earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand,
   the regional economy outpaced national economic growth rates for several
   years during the rebuild. The repair work on the built environment
   created years of elevated building activity. However, after the peak of
   the rebuilding activity, as economic and employment growth retracts
   below national growth, we are left with the question of how the
   underlying economy performs during large scale stimulus activity in the
   built environment. This paper assesses the performance of the underlying
   economy by quantifying the usual, demand-driven level of building
   activity at this time. Applying an Input-Output approach and excluding
   the economic benefit gained from the investment stimulus reveals the
   performance of the underlying economy. The results reveal a strong
   growing underlying economy, and while convergence was expected as the
   stimulus slowed down, the results found that growth had already crossed
   over for some time. The results reveal that the investment stimulus
   provides an initial 1.5\% to 2\% growth buffer from the underlying
   economy before the growth rates cross over. This supports short-term
   economic recovery and enables the underlying economy to transition away
   from a significant rebuild stimulus. Once the growth crosses over, five
   years after the disaster, economic growth in the underlying economy
   remains buoyant even if official regional economic data suggest
   otherwise.},

Title = {Spanwise wing morphing using multistable cellular metastructures},
Journal = {EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Morphing wings have the potential to provide additional functionality or
   increased performance to aircraft that serve in multiple roles and
   exhibit distinct aerodynamic characteristics. In-flight aspect ratio
   adaptation from spanwise morphing is one avenue for achieving this
   potential. This shape adaptability would allow the aircraft to extend
   the wings for an efficient loitering mode and retract them to better
   enable a high-speed dash. Spanwise morphing has historically been
   accomplished through the use of telescoping mechanisms, which lead to
   greater mechanical complexity and increased weight. This paper proposes
   a novel, lightweight, compliant structure composed of cellular
   metamaterials exhibiting multiple stable shapes. These metastructures
   enable spanwise morphing by allowing large, elastic deformations while
   maintaining their ability to bear loads. The physical and mechanical
   properties of a selection of multistable honeycombs with different unit
   cells are characterized using analytical and numerical methods. Their
   in-plane and flexural mechanical properties and their structural
   efficiency are compared to each other and to a conventional hexagonal
   honeycomb. Two multistable honeycombs are selected and utilized to
   develop a beam-like metastructure capable of shape adaptation in a
   single direction. The flexural mechanical properties of this metabeam
   are investigated using numerical and physical methods. We demonstrate
   the viability of the metabeam as a shape adaptable metastructure by
   developing a hybrid span-morphing wing concept that combines
   conventional, rigid structures with the compliant metabeam. The wing is
   analyzed using an uncoupled static aeroelastic tool to assess its
   performance under aerodynamic loading, showing the ability to increase
   lift from spanwise morphing without increasing wing flexural deflection.

Title = {The effect of food additives and cooking on the antioxidant properties

Journal = {NUTRITION \& FOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to study the effect of cooking and food
   additives, such as lemon juice and vinegar, on phenols and flavonoids
   contents and antioxidant activity of purslane.
   Design/methodology/approach The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to
   determine total phenols content (TP), while total flavonoid content (TF)
   was determined by the aluminum chloride method. Two methods were used
   for determination of antioxidant activity: DPPH (1,
   1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay to determine radical scavenging
   activity, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) to measure the
   reducing power. Findings According to the results, leafs had higher
   values of TP, TF and antioxidant activity than aerial parts. Both lemon
   juice and vinegar retracted antioxidant properties of leafs. TP and TF
   of leaves showed deterioration after treatment with lemon by 58\% and
   21.8\%, respectively, and FRAP and radical scavenging activity decreased
   by 75.8\% and 74.5\%, respectively (p < 0.001). Also, TP, TF, FRAP and
   DPPH radical scavenging activity decreased in leaves by 82.2\%, 30.5\%,
   87.8\% and 90.9\%, respectively, after treatment of leaves with vinegar.
   TF increased after cooking in studied parts, where no significant
   statistical difference was observed in TP and antioxidant activity (DPPH
   assay and FRAP) of cooked aerial parts. Adding lemon juice after cooking
   increased antioxidant properties of purslane (p < 0.001).
   Originality/value Purslane has antioxidant activity because it is rich
   in polyphenols and flavonoids. Effects of food additives and cooking
   were studied using different measurements. According to the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first work that studied the effect of food
   additives on antioxidant properties of purslane.},

Abstract = {A collection of formulae, regarded as a set of prerequisite-free normal
   defaults, generates a nonmonotonic inference relation through its Reiter
   skeptical extension. The structure of the initial set totally determines
   the behavior of the associated inference relation, and the aim of this
   paper is to investigate in two directions the link that exists between a
   set of defaults and its induced inference relation. First, we determine
   the structural conditions corresponding to the important property of
   rationality. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of stratification
   for a set of defaults, and prove that stratified sets are exactly those
   that induce a rational inference relation. This result is shown to have
   interesting consequences in belief revision theory, as it can be used to
   define a nontrivial full meet revision operator for belief bases. Then,
   we adopt a dynamic point of view and study the effects, on the induced
   inference relation, of a change in the set of defaults. In this
   perspective, the set of defaults, considered as a knowledge base,
   together with its induced inference relation is treated as an expert
   system. We show how to modify the original set of defaults in order to
   obtain as output a rational relation. We propose a revision procedure
   that enables the user to incorporate a new data in the knowledge base,
   and we finally show what changes can be performed on the original set of
   defaults in order to take into account a particular conditional that has
   to retracted from or added to the primitive induced inference relation.

Abstract = {Data from natural sources show counter-intuitive distribution patterns
   for the leading digits to the left of the decimal point and the digit 1
   is observed more frequently than all other numbers. This pattern, which
   was first described by Newcomb and later confirmed by Benford, is used
   in financial and tax auditing to detect fraud. Deviations from the
   pattern indicate possible falsifications. Anesthesiology journals are
   affected not only by ghostwriting and plagiarism but also by
   counterfeiting. In the present study 20 publications in anesthesiology
   known to be falsified by an author were investigated for irregularities
   with respect to Benford's law using the chi(2)-test and the Z-test. In
   the 20 retracted publications an average first-digit frequency of 243.1
   (standard deviation SD +/- 118.2, range: 30-592) and an average
   second-digit frequency of 132.3 (SD +/- 72.2, range: 15-383) were found.
   The observed distribution of the first and second digits to the left of
   the decimal point differed significantly (p < 0.01) from the expected
   distribution described by Benford. Only the observed absolute
   frequencies for digits 3, 4 and 5 did not differ significantly from the
   expected values. In an analysis of each paper 17 out of 20 studies
   differed significantly from the expected value for the first digit and
   18 out of 20 studies varied significantly from the expected value of the
   second digit. Only one paper did not vary significantly from expected
   values for the digits to the left of the decimal. For comparison, a
   meta-analysis using complex mathematical procedures was chosen as a
   control. The analysis showed a first-digit distribution consistent with
   the Benford distribution. Thus, the method used in the present study
   seems to be sensitive for detecting fraud. Additional statements of
   specificity cannot yet be made as this requires further analysis of data
   that is definitely not falsified. Future studies exploring conformity
   might help prevent falsified studies from being published.},

Title = {Coverage Assessment and Target Tracking in 3D Domains},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Pages = {9904-9927},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recent advances in integrated electronic devices motivated the use of
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in many applications including domain
   surveillance and mobile target tracking, where a number of sensors are
   scattered within a sensitive region to detect the presence of intruders
   and forward related events to some analysis center(s). Obviously, sensor
   deployment should guarantee an optimal event detection rate and should
   reduce coverage holes. Most of the coverage control approaches proposed
   in the literature deal with two-dimensional zones and do not develop
   strategies to handle coverage in three-dimensional domains, which is
   becoming a requirement for many applications including water monitoring,
   indoor surveillance, and projectile tracking. This paper proposes
   efficient techniques to detect coverage holes in a 3D domain using a
   finite set of sensors, repair the holes, and track hostile targets. To
   this end, we use the concepts of Voronoi tessellation, Vietoris complex,
   and retract by deformation. We show in particular that, through a set of
   iterative transformations of the Vietoris complex corresponding to the
   deployed sensors, the number of coverage holes can be computed with a
   low complexity. Mobility strategies are also proposed to repair holes by
   moving appropriately sensors towards the uncovered zones. The tracking
   objective is to set a non-uniform WSN coverage within the monitored
   domain to allow detecting the target(s) by the set of sensors. We show,
   in particular, how the proposed algorithms adapt to cope with obstacles.
   Simulation experiments are carried out to analyze the efficiency of the
   proposed models. To our knowledge, repairing and tracking is addressed
   for the first time in 3D spaces with different sensor coverage schemes.},

Abstract = {Drop dynamics plays a central role in defining the interfacial
   morphology in two-phase complex fluids such as emulsions and polymer
   blends. In such materials, the components are often microstructured
   complex fluids themselves. To model and simulate drop behavior in such
   systems, one has to deal with the dual complexity of non-Newtonian
   rheology and evolving interfaces. Recently, we developed a
   diffuse-interface formulation which incorporates complex rheology and
   interfacial dynamics in a unified framework. This paper uses a two
   dimensional implementation of the method to simulate drop coalescence
   after head-on collision and drop retraction from an elongated initial
   shape in a quiescent matrix. One of the two phases is a viscoelastic
   fluid modeled by an Oldroyd-B equation and the other is Newtonian. For
   the parameter values examined here, numerical results show that after
   drop collision, film drainage is enhanced when either phase is
   viscoelastic and drop coalescence happens more readily than in a
   comparable Newtonian system. The last stage of coalescence is dominated
   by a short-range molecular force in the model that is comparable to van
   der Waals force. The retraction of drops from an initial state of
   zero-velocity and zero-stress is hastened at first, but later resisted
   by viscoelasticity in either component. When retracting from an initial
   state with pre-existing stress, produced by cessation of steady
   shearing, viscoelasticity in the matrix hinders retraction from the
   beginning while that in the drop initially enhances retraction but later
   resists it. These results and the physical mechanisms that they reveal
   are consistent with prior experimental observations. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a novel retractable main
   landing gear for a light amphibious airplane, while the design,
   synthesis and analysis are given in details for constructing the main
   landing gear. Design/methodology/approach The constraint three-position
   synthesis has given the correct path of all linkages that suitably fit
   the landing gear into the compartment. The additional lock-link is
   introduced into the design to ensure the securement of the mechanism
   while landing. Having the telescopic gas-oil shock strut as a core
   element to absorb the impact load, it enhances the ability and
   efficiency to withstand higher impact than others type of light
   amphibious airplane. Findings By kinematics bifurcation analysis, the
   optimized value of the unlock spring stiffness at 90 N/m can be found to
   tremendously reduce the extended-retracted linear actuator force from
   500 N to 150 N at the beginning of the retraction sequence. This could
   limit the size and weight of the landing gear actuator of the light
   amphibious airplane. Practical implications The drop test of the landing
   gear to comply with the ASTM f-2245 (Standard Specification for Design
   and Performance of a Light Sport Airplane) reveals that the novel
   landing gear can withstand the impact load at the drop height determined
   by the standard. The maximum impact loading 4.8 G occurs at the drop
   height of 300 mm, and there is no sign of any detrimental or failure of
   the landing gear or the structure of the light amphibious airplane. The
   impact settling time response reaches the 2\% of steady-state value in
   approximately 1.2 s that ensure the safety and stability of the
   amphibious airplane if it subjects to an accidentally hard landing.
   Originality/value This paper presents unique applications of a
   retractable main landing gear of a light amphibious airplane. The
   proposed landing gear functions properly and complies with the drop test
   standard, ensuring the safety and reliability of the airplane and
   exploiting the airworthiness certification process.},

Title = {Efficacy of topical vs intravenous tranexamic acid in reducing blood
   loss and promoting wound healing in bone surgery: A systematic review
   and meta-analysis},
Journal = {WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {17},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been used as an anti-fibrinolytic drug for
   over half a century and has received much attention in recent decades.
   AIM
   To evaluate the efficacy of topical vs intravenous TXA in reducing blood
   loss and promoting wound healing in bone surgery.
   METHODS
   From the electronic resources, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, ISI,
   and Scopus were used to perform a literature search over the last 10
   years between 2010 and 2020. EndNote (TM) X8 was used for managing the
   electronic resource. Searches were performed with mesh terms. The data
   were retracted blindly by two independent reviewers. Random effects were
   used to deal with potential heterogeneity and I-2 showed heterogeneity.
   Chi-square (I-2) tests were used to quantify the extent of heterogeneity
   (P < 0.01 was considered statistically significant). The efficacy of
   topical TXA in reducing blood loss and promoting wound healing in bone
   surgery was compared with intravenous TXA and placebo.
   RESULTS
   According to the research design, 1360 potentially important research
   abstracts and titles were discovered in our electronic searches, and 18
   papers remained in agreement with our inclusion criteria. It was found
   that TXA reduced 277.51 mL of blood loss compared to placebo, and there
   was no significant difference between topical TXA and IV TXA in reducing
   blood loss in bone surgery. Our analyses also showed that TXA
   significantly reduced blood transfusion compared to placebo and there
   was no significant difference between topical TXA and IV TXA.
   CONCLUSION
   The use of both topical and intravenous TXA are equally effective in
   reducing blood loss in bone surgery, which might be beneficial for wound
   healing after surgery.},

Abstract = {Many intriguing science discoveries on planetary surfaces, such as the
   seasonal flows on crater walls and skylight entrances to lava tubes, are
   at sites that are currently inaccessible to state-of-the-art rovers. The
   in situ exploration of such sites is likely to require a tethered
   platform both for mechanical support and for providing power and
   communication. Mother/daughter architectures have been investigated
   where a mother deploys a tethered daughter into extreme terrains.
   Deploying and retracting a tethered daughter requires undocking and
   re-docking of the daughter to the mother, with the latter being the
   challenging part. In this paper, we describe a vision-based
   tether-assisted algorithm for the autonomous re-docking of a daughter to
   its mother following an extreme terrain excursion. The algorithm uses
   fiducials mounted on the mother to improve the reliability and accuracy
   of estimating the pose of the mother relative to the daughter. The
   tether that is anchored by the mother helps the docking process and
   increases the system's tolerance to pose uncertainties by mechanically
   aligning the mating parts in the final docking phase. A preliminary
   version of the algorithm was developed and field-tested on the Axel
   rover in the JPL Mars Yard. The algorithm achieved an 80\% success rate
   in 40 experiments in both firm and loose soils and starting from up to 6
   m away at up to 40 degrees radial angle and 20 degrees relative heading.
   The algorithm does not rely on an initial estimate of the relative pose.
   The preliminary results are promising and help retire the risk
   associated with the autonomous docking process enabling consideration in
   future martian and lunar missions.},

Title = {Air entrained into viscous liquid by a disk: Confinement induced
   suppression of breakup},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {When a solid object falls into a bath of viscous liquid due to gravity
   with zero initial velocity, air can be entrained into the viscous liquid
   with the solid. We study such an air entrainment by a metal disk falling
   in the direction perpendicular to its axis in a confined space. We
   previously reported that the entrained air is extended and forms a thin
   sheet, which finally detaches from the disk with a topological change:
   The extended air breaks up into two parts, after which the lower part
   becomes a small bubble and the upper part starts retracting upwards
   {[}Phys. Rev. Fluids 3, 054004 (2018)]. In the present paper, we further
   confined the air sheet using thinner disks, to surprisingly find a
   complete suppression of a topological change: The entrained air detaches
   from the disk without breakup (i.e., without creating a small bubble)
   but with forming, instead of a sheet, an elliptic corn at the tip. The
   physical origin of the confinement induced suppression of breakup is
   discussed from the viewpoints of the inversion of curvature of an
   air-liquid interface and the movement of the contact line. Near the
   corn-forming detachment, three length scales characterizing the dynamics
   are all proportional to a single characteristic length as in the
   previous sheet-forming case, which leads to a fixed aspect ratio for the
   elliptic corn in the present case. The characteristic scale satisfies a
   simple scaling law, which is different from the previous sheet-forming
   case, and governs the self-similar dynamics near the detachment point.
   The present corn-forming case provides a remarkable scenario for the
   self-similar dynamics discussed in various fields such as statistical
   physics, applied mathematics, and hydrodynamic topology transitions.},

Title = {Native Language Influence on Brass Instrument Performance: An
   Application of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to Midsagittal
   Ultrasound Images of the Tongue},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {This paper presents the findings of an ultrasound study of 10 New
   Zealand English and 10 Tongan-speaking trombone players, to determine
   whether there is an influence of native language speech production on
   trombone performance. Trombone players' midsagittal tongue shapes were
   recorded while reading wordlists and during sustained note productions,
   and tongue surface contours traced. After normalizing to account for
   differences in vocal tract shape and ultrasound transducer orientation,
   we used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to estimate average
   tongue surface shapes used by the players from the two language groups
   when producing notes at different pitches and intensities, and during
   the production of the monophthongs in their native languages. The
   average midsagittal tongue contours predicted by our models show a
   statistically robust difference at the back of the tongue distinguishing
   the two groups, where the New Zealand English players display an overall
   more retracted tongue position; however, tongue shape during playing
   does not directly map onto vowel tongue shapes as prescribed by the
   pedagogical literature. While the New Zealand English-speaking
   participants employed a playing tongue shape approximating schwa and the
   vowel used in the word `lot,' the Tongan participants used a tongue
   shape loosely patterning with the back vowels /o/ and /u/. We argue that
   these findings represent evidence for native language influence on brass
   instrument performance; however, this influence seems to be secondary to
   more basic constraints of brass playing related to airflow requirements
   and acoustical considerations, with the vocal tract configurations
   observed across both groups satisfying these conditions in different
   ways. Our findings furthermore provide evidence for the functional
   independence of various sections of the tongue and indicate that speech
   production, itself an acquired motor skill, can influence another
   skilled behavior via motor memory of vocal tract gestures forming the
   basis of local optimization processes to arrive at a suitable tongue
   shape for sustained note production.},

Abstract = {Wetting of partially wettable porous solids is encountered in many and
   diverse applications such as imbibition of liquid reactants into pores
   of porous catalysts and adsorbents in reactor beds, water vapor
   condensation on porous substrates like leaves, and spreading of liquid
   condensate on fuel cell membranes. This wetting is a combination of
   liquid spreading/retraction on the external surface and imbibition into
   the pores. In this paper, we establish the basic ``building block{''} of
   this problem, i.e., the dynamics of wetting and retraction of a thin
   film in the vicinity of a single infinite pore of a porous solid and
   show the way forward by discussing the case of two such adjacent pores.
   The coupled process described by a unified and simple model derived from
   equations of motion under the lubrication approximation for thin film
   flow on the external surface and Hagen-Poiseulle flow inside the pores.
   A single final evolution equation tracks the externally wetted region in
   time by solving for the height of the liquid surface starting from an
   initial liquid droplet. The wetted area initially expands as the droplet
   spreads and then contracts as droplet retracts due to imbibition in the
   pore. The liquid surface becomes increasingly liable to rupture under
   the influence of intermolecular forces as it thins because of
   imbibition. The governing equation can track the rupture and subsequent
   dewetting of the surface also. The liquid morphology and kinetics of
   wetting show good agreement with the reported experiments implying that
   the description of a spreading liquid as a thin film indeed manages to
   incorporate the most important physics governing the internal wetting of
   liquids on porous substrates at the micro scale. The model shows a
   possible way to develop wetting correlations for larger scales of flow
   in industrial trickle bed reactors in a bottom-up manner. (C) 2017

Title = {Multi-state vertical-blinds solar shading - Performance assessment and
   recommended development directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of a novel
   multi-state sun-tracking vertical-blind (ST-VB) concept using building
   performance simulation (BPS). A multi-domain simulation toolchain was
   developed and verified to evaluate the interior vertical-blind concept.
   The toolchain is used to quantify whole-building performance effects of
   design choices in the development of the initial concept within a larger
   framework of functional and aesthetic requirements. Multiple control
   concepts are tested, including different sun-tracking approaches,
   utilising the double-sided blind to switch between absorbing and
   reflecting solar radiation, and the ability to fully retract the blinds
   versus rotating them into an open position. Different possible
   materialisations of the blind are tested by evaluating the performance
   sensitivity of each of the potential control strategies to varying the
   blinds' solar and visible reflectance. The most promising ST-VB
   strategies perform substantially better than a conventional automated
   roller-blind strategy in terms of preventing visual discomfort (8\% less
   DGPs(0.4exc0deg)), the admission of daylight (75-99\% higher
   sDA(300lx/50\%)), allowing for views to the outdoors (8-33\% more hours
   with a view), and energy performance (11-35\% reduction in primary
   energy consumption for heating, cooling and lighting). This research
   concludes with a set of recommendations for the development of the ST-VB
   system and by extrapolating the `lessons-learned' for future research
   and development into multi-state solar shading systems. The novelty of
   this research can be found in that automated control concepts for
   interior vertical blinds have thus far been largely unexplored.
   Additionally, this research contributes to the body of knowledge on
   performance modelling of complex fenestration systems and the use of BPS
   in the, relatively new, context of product development.},

Title = {The timing of pre-nuclear pitch accents in Persian},

Volume = {49},

Pages = {305-329},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines the phonetic realization of rising pre-nuclear pitch
   accents in Persian. In a first experiment, the alignment of f0 valleys
   and peaks in pre-nuclear pitch accents was analyzed in controlled speech
   materials as a function of the syllable structure (open vs. closed) and
   vowel type (short vs. long) of the accented syllable. The results
   revealed that in words with antepenultimate stress, both the L and the H
   tones are anchored to specific segmental landmarks irrespective of
   syllable structure or vowel type. In particular, the L is consistently
   aligned with the onset of the accented syllable, and the H is placed
   with similar consistency in the vicinity of the first post-accentual
   vowel. In a second experiment, the variability in the timing and scaling
   of L valleys and H peaks was examined as a function of the proximity of
   the word boundary and of the following accent. The results revealed that
   while the alignment of the L was unaffected by changes in stress
   conditions, H peaks were significantly retracted as the syllable
   approached the end of the word. However, the proximity of the following
   accent did not produce a significant effect on H alignment. In addition,
   no significant differences were found on L and H scaling in different
   stress or tonal crowding conditions. Overall, the results contribute to
   a growing body of evidence that in the absence of upcoming prosodic
   pressure, the alignment of pitch targets is specified relative to
   segmental positions. A comparison between these findings and empirical
   findings from other languages reveals fine phonetic differences of
   segmental anchoring that are less likely to be interpreted in terms of
   distinct association-based phonological representations, and suggests
   that some aspects of segmental anchoring need to be explained in terms
   of continuous language-specific alignment rules.},

Abstract = {The violence experienced in different regions of Mexico, and which has
   been exacerbated particularly in the State of Michoacan, has triggered
   the formation of the so-called self-defense groups. The aim of this
   paper was to analyze the characteristics of the emergence and operation
   of activities of self-defense in the communities of the Ruana and
   Tepalcatepec, located in the region known as Tierra Caliente, in the
   State of Michoacan, Mexico. Data presented in the article were obtained
   from two fieldwork trips made during 2014, where eleven people were
   interviewed: two members of the movement of self-defense and nine
   political and social leaders of the communities. Evidence was also
   collected at a public meeting, where five leaders of the self-defense
   groups participated. The results reveal that the formation of community
   self-defense groups was triggered by the breakdown in the local order.
   Such breakdown was caused by a new form of operation of drug trafficking
   groups, based on extortion revenue and an excessive control over the
   region, which in turn had an influence on the balance of local power and
   tolerance towards illegal activities. The Government's response was the
   legalization of these groups through the formation of a rural police
   force. This new police force has been questioned by members of
   self-defense groups, who have rejected such a move, holding that such
   legalization is a replacement of beneficiaries of illegal activities.
   Self-defense movement refers to a recomposition in the balance of local
   power relations between drug trafficking, communities and State. It
   represents a dispute for the establishment of an order that retracts the
   aggression to the communities and recomposes illegal business operation
   with new actors and in a less invasive manner.},

Title = {Stability and economic evaluation of multi-step horizontal salt caverns
   with different step distances in bedded salt formations br},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A multi-step horizontal salt cavern (MSHSC) for energy storage has been
   drawing more attention, using retractable water-injection tubes to mine
   larger storage spaces between two boreholes. The retract distance per
   step best determines the shape of the cavern roof, and thus has an
   important influence on the stability of MSHSCs. This paper discusses the
   impact of the step distance on the stability and economy of MSHSCs. The
   geometry of MSHSCs with different step distances is obtained using our
   previously developed solution mining model. Geo-mechanical models are
   developed based on the geometry and the geo-conditions of Jintan salt
   mine in China. Then a series of static creep analyses are performed
   using FLAC3D software. Results show that smaller step distances mean
   higher stability risks during long-term operation. As the step distance
   is reduced, both the volume shrinkage and plastic zone volume increase.
   In the displacement contours after 30 years of operation, the large
   displacement zone increases significantly with decreasing step distance.
   However, the cavern volume and expected revenue increase with decreasing
   step distance, contrary to the stability parameters. Economic analysis
   with integrated stability considerations is conducted to give a balanced
   step distance. Volume shrinkage is considered in the calculation of
   effective cavern volume. Plastic zone volume is reflected in the space
   cost of MSHSCs, since it influences the thickness of the cavern top
   plate and the pillar width between adjacent caverns. Further, a
   comprehensive indicator of economic cost/expected revenue per unit
   volume of rock salt versus time is proposed, calculated, and compared.
   According to the comparison results, a medium step distance of 100 m or
   125 m is recommended for the design of MSHSCs in a given salt layer,
   with the stability and economic con-siderations best balanced},

   can remove references to the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
   (MMAS-8) and republish the article without such references.
   Dr. Casebeer's team obtained a license to use the MMAS-8 scale from Dr.
   Morisky prior to conducting the study. Nevertheless, after publication
   of a separate article in the Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes that
   also cited the MMAS-8, as the lead author, Dr. Casebeer was contacted by
   Dr. Morisky who requested that a number of changes be made to the
   article. Dr. Casebeer and her team have no desire to engage in a dispute
   with Dr. Morisky and therefore proactively contacted the Editor of
   Population Health Management and requested that the scale be removed
   from her published paper. After assessing all of the provided
   information, the Editor agreed to the authors' request.
   It is important to note that the retraction of Dr. Casebeer's article is
   not the result of any misconduct on her part or that of her team. The
   retraction serves to remove the published version of the article that
   contains the MMAS-8 scale and a revised version that does not contain
   the tool or any references to it will be published. The elimination of
   the scale does not alter the results or conclusions of the study.
   Population Health Management is committed to upholding the highest
   standards of peer review and the community it serves.},

Title = {Linking Cognitive and Social Aspects of Sound Change Using Agent-Based

Abstract = {The paper defines the core components of an interactive-phonetic (IP)
   sound change model. The starting point for the IP-model is that a
   phonological category is often skewed phonetically in a certain
   direction by the production and perception of speech. A prediction of
   the model is that sound change is likely to come about as a result of
   perceiving phonetic variants in the direction of the skew and at the
   probabilistic edge of the listener's phonological category. The results
   of agent-based computational simulations applied to the sound change in
   progress, /u/-fronting in Standard Southern British, were consistent
   with this hypothesis. The model was extended to sound changes involving
   splits and mergers by using the interaction between the agents to drive
   the phonological reclassification of perceived speech signals. The
   simulations showed no evidence of any acoustic change when this extended
   model was applied to Australian English data in which /s/ has been shown
   to retract due to coarticulation in /str/ clusters. Some agents
   nevertheless varied in their phonological categorizations during
   interaction between /str/ and /?tr/: This vacillation may represent the
   potential for sound change to occur. The general conclusion is that many
   types of sound change are the outcome of how phonetic distributions are
   oriented with respect to each other, their association to phonological
   classes, and how these types of information vary between speakers that
   happen to interact with each other.
   Using agent-based modelling, Harrington, Kleber, Reubold, Schiel \&
   Stevens (2018) develop a unified model of sound change based on
   cognitive processing of human speech and theories of how social factors
   constrain the spread of change throughout a community. They conclude
   that many types of change result from how biases in the phonetic
   distribution of phonological categories are transmitted via
   accommodation processes between individuals in interaction.},

   GROWTH CONE MORPHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Changes in neurite outgrowth parameters and in the immunolocalization of
   the neuronal growth-associated protein B-50 (GAP-43) were studied in
   cultured neocortex as a function of development. In addition, we studied
   the effects of chronic blockade of bioelectric activity (BEA) with
   tetrodotoxin (TTX) on these parameters.
   Axonal outgrowth rate in control cultures reached a maximum at 8 days in
   vitro (DIV) and declined to a low level at 21 DIV. B-50 staining shifted
   from the perikaryon to the axons and growth cones during the first 3
   DIV. In axons the intensity of B-50 staining increased towards the
   growth cone. Within growth cones, the central/basal region and filopodia
   were intensely stained, whereas lamellipodia showed only marginal
   staining. Growth cone size gradually decreased after 3 DIV, due to the
   successive loss of lamellipodia and filopodia, and became club-shaped
   during the second week, until by 21 DIV growth cones were completely
   lost, and axons started retracting and degenerated. In the central area
   of the cultures, growth cones also decreased in size with time, but
   became stabilized as presynaptic elements onto other neurons.
   Acute addition of TTX did not affect the outgrowth rate at 6 DIV.
   Chronic TTX treatment led to an earlier retraction and degeneration of
   axons than in control cultures and to a loss of B-50-stained cells and
   varicosities during the third week, but did not affect growth cone
   morphology or B-50 staining. The regressive phenomena are probably due
   to an increased neuronal cell death shown to occur after chronic TTX
   treatment. The developmental changes in axonal elongation rate and
   growth cone morphology may be related to developmental changes in the
   content and/or phosphorylation of B-50 (GAP-43, which are studied in the
   same cultures in the following paper {[}Ramakers et al. (1991) Int. J.

Title = {Phase-separated microstructures in ``all-acrylic{''} thermoplastic
   elastomers},
Journal = {MACROMOLECULAR SYMPOSIA},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {117-137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is used to study the phase separation
   process occurring in block copolymers in the solid state. Measuring
   simultaneously the amplitude and the phase of the oscillating cantilever
   in tapping-mode operation provides the surface topography along with the
   cartography of microdomains with different mechanical properties. This
   in turn allows to characterize the organization of the various
   components at the surface in terms of well-defined morphologies (e.g.,
   spheres, cylinders, or lamellae). Here this approach is applied to a
   series of symmetric triblock copolymers made of a central elastomeric
   segment polyalkylacrylate) surrounded by two thermoplastic sequences
   (polymethylmethacrylate). The occurrence of microphase separation in
   these materials and the resulting microscopic morphology are essential
   factors for determining their potential applications as a new class of
   thermoplastic elastomers. This paper describes how the surface
   morphology can be controlled by the molecular structure of the
   copolymers (volume ratio between the sequences, molecular weight, length
   of the alkyl side group) and by the experimental conditions used for the
   preparation of the films. The molecular structure of the chains is fully
   determined by the synthesis of the copolymers via living anionic
   polymerization while the parameters that can be modified when preparing
   the samples are the nature of the solvent and the thermal annealing of
   the films. Finally, we report on a systematic comparison between images
   and approach-retract curve data. We show that this experimental
   comparison allows the origin of the contrast that produces the image to
   he straightforwardly evaluated. The method provides an unambiguous
   quantitative measurement of the contribution of the local mechanical
   response to the image. We show that most of the contrast in the height
   and phase images is due to variations in local mechanical properties and
   not in topography.},

Abstract = {Over the recent years, ship traffic in the polar areas has increased.
   There is reason to believe that this traffic, and especially the cruise
   traffic, will increase further as the ice retracts towards the poles.
   There is also reason to believe that with the continued focus and
   exposure of the Polar Region, the cruise tourism to the region will
   grow.
   The increased presence in the polar areas will create positive
   repercussions for several actors, both on sea and land. There will,
   however, also be challenges associated with the growing presence in the
   polar areas. Vessels will be operating at long distances to other
   vessels and land infrastructures. These vessels will also be operating
   in climate and conditions that will put extra pressure on both vessel
   and crew. These challenges need to be solved in order for the ship
   industry to operate safely in the Polar Region.
   To ensure that companies operating in these areas identify and manage
   these challenges, the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
   developed the Polar Code (2017) with the intent of increasing the safety
   for vessels operating in polar waters, and to reduce the impact on
   humans and environment in this remote, vulnerable and harsh area. This
   code defines a number of requirements, with which the vessels should
   operate in accordance with.
   In this paper, we reveal which challenges the vessel and its crew need
   to deal with when navigating in polar waters. The challenges will be
   analysed and assessed through the use of a preliminary qualitative risk
   analysis to determine the potential hazards the vessel is exposed to
   under operations in polar waters, and to find out what level of risk the
   different hazards represents for the vessel and its crew. The main
   objective of the paper is to find out how the risk levels can be
   reduced, with particular focus on the use of simulator training as a
   risk reducing measure. The final goal is to measure the risk towards
   acceptance criteria, which have been determined prior to conducting the
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Conflicts of interest (COIs) do occur in healthcare research, yet their
   impact on research in the field of infection prevention and control
   (IPC) is unknown. We conducted a narrative review aiming to identify
   examples of COIs in IPC research. In addition to well-known instances,
   we conducted PubMed and Google searches to identify and report case
   studies of COIs in IPC and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which were
   chosen arbitrarily following consensus meetings, to illustrate different
   types of COIs. We also searched the RetractionWatch database and blog to
   systematically identify retracted IPC and/or infectious disease-related
   papers. Our review highlights COIs in academic research linked to ties
   between industry and physicians, journal editors, peer-reviewed
   journals' choice for publication, and guideline committees participants
   and authors. It explores how COIs can affect research and could be
   managed. We also present several selected case studies that involve (1)
   the chlorhexidine industry and how it has used marketing trials and key
   opinion leaders to promote off-label use of its products; (2) the copper
   industry and how reporting of its trials in IPC have furthered their
   agenda; (3) the influence of a company developing closed infusion
   systems for catheters and how this affects networks in low- and
   middle-income countries and guideline development; (4) potential
   perverse incentives hospitals may have in reporting
   healthcare-associated infection or AMR rates and how government
   intervention may restrict AMR research for fear of bad publicity and
   subsequent negative economic consequences. Finally, the analysis of
   reasons for the retraction of previously published papers highlights the
   fact that misconduct in research may have other motivations than
   financial gain, the most visible form of COIs. COIs occur in the field
   of research in general, and IPC and AMR are no exceptions. Their effects
   pervade all aspects of the research and publication processes. We
   believe that, in addition to improvements in management strategies of
   COIs, increased public funding should be available to decrease
   researchers' dependency on industry ties. Further research is needed on
   COIs and their management.},

Title = {VR Exploration Assistance through Automatic Occlusion Removal},

Abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) applications allow a user to explore a scene
   intuitively through a tracked head-mounted display (HMD). However, in
   complex scenes, occlusions make scene exploration inefficient, as the
   user has to navigate around occluders to gain line of sight to potential
   regions of interest. When a scene region proves to be of no interest,
   the user has to retrace their path, and such a sequential scene
   exploration implies significant amounts of wasted navigation.
   Furthermore, as the virtual world is typically much larger than the
   tracked physical space hosting the VR application, the intuitive
   one-to-one mapping between the virtual and real space has to be
   temporarily suspended for the user to teleport or redirect in order to
   conform to the physical space constraints. In this paper we introduce a
   method for improving VR exploration efficiency by automatically
   constructing a multiperspective visualization that removes occlusions.
   For each frame, the scene is first rendered conventionally, the z-buffer
   is analyzed to detect horizontal and vertical depth discontinuities, the
   discontinuities are used to define disocclusion portals which are 3D
   scene rectangles for routing rays around occluders, and the disocclusion
   portals are used to render a multiperpsective image that alleviates
   occlusions. The user controls the multiperspective disocclusion effect,
   deploying and retracting it with small head translations. We have
   quantified the VR exploration efficiency brought by our occlusion
   removal method in a study where participants searched for a stationary
   target, and chased a dynamic target. Our method showed an advantage over
   conventional VR exploration in terms of reducing the navigation
   distance, the view direction rotation, the number of redirections, and
   the task completion time. These advantages did not come at the cost of a
   reduction in depth perception or situational awareness, or of an
   increase in simulator sickness.},

Title = {Semantics for update rule programs and implementation in a relational

Volume = {21},

Abstract = {In this paper we present our research on defining a correct semantics
   for a class of update rule (UR) programs, and discuss implementing these
   programs in a DBMS environment. Update rules execute by updating
   relations in a database which may cause the further execution of rules.
   A correct semantics must guarantee that the execution of the rules will
   terminate and that it will produce a minimal updated database. The class
   of UR programs is syntactically identified, based upon a concept that is
   similar to stratification. We extend the strict definition of
   stratification and allow a relaxed criterion for partitioning of the
   rules in the UR program. This relaxation allows a limited degree of
   nondeterminism in rule execution. We define an execution semantics based
   upon a monotonic fixpoint operator T-UR, resulting in a set of fixpoints
   for UR. The monotonicity of the operator is maintained by explicitly
   representing the effect of asserting and retracting tuples in the
   database. A declarative semantics for the update rule program is
   obtained by associating a normal logic program UR to represent the UR
   program. We use the stable model semantics which characterize a normal
   logic program by a set of minimal models which are called stable models.
   We show the equivalence between the set of fixpoints for UR and the set
   of stable models for UR. We briefly discuss implementing the fixpoint
   semantics of the UR program in a DBMS environment. Relations that can be
   updated by the rules are updatable relations and they are extended with
   two flags. An update rule is represented by a database query, which
   queries the updatable relations as well as database relations, i.e.,
   those relations which are not updated by rules. We describe an algorithm
   to process the queries and compute a fixpoint in the DBMS environment
   and obtain a final database.},

Title = {The communicative meaning of body oscillations in the social wasp,

Journal = {INSECTES SOCIAUX},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {215-230},
Abstract = {The oscillatory behavior of paper wasps, Polistes fuscatus, was examined
   in field observations (401.9 h) of 37 preworker (pre-emergence),
   multiple-foundress colonies. Additional field observations were
   conducted on 16 multiple-foundress colonies (96 h) both before and after
   worker emergence, and on 10 preworker colonies (40 h) before and after
   eggs had hatched into larvae. In addition, we observed 18 preworker,
   multiple-foundress colonies: six undisturbed controls (12 h), six larvae
   removed (12 h), and six larvae removed and replaced (12 h). Finally, we
   analysed video and audio sequences of oscillatory behaviors (lateral
   vibrations).
   Higher ranked foundresses performed lateral vibrations (LVs) at a
   significantly greater rate than lower ranked foundresses. However, there
   was no significant association between rates of LVs and (1) aggression
   or (2) magnitude of differences in dominance indices among
   cofoundresses. There was also no significant temporal association
   between LVs and departures or returns.
   Lateral vibrations were commonly performed by foundresses that were
   alone on the nest. These results and others indicate that LVs do not
   function in adult-adult communication. Lateral vibrations were
   significantly. temporally associated with high activity level, primarily
   cell inspection. Lateral vibrations were significantly, positively
   correlated with abdominal wagging and antennal drumming, both of which
   have been implicated in adult-larval communication. Foundresses of
   colonies containing eggs only (compared to colonies containing eggs and
   larvae) rarely displayed LVs. Removal of larvae significantly reduced
   the rates of LVs and the replacement of removed larvae caused a marked
   increase in the rates of LVs. Video analyses revealed that larvae
   retracted their head capsules in response to an LV. All of these data
   indicate that LVs involve adult-larval communication via substrate
   vibrations. Some indirect evidence suggests that LVs signal larvae to
   stop secreting saliva to adult wasps.},

   Investigation by the Search Coil Magnetometers (SCM) Onboard Bepicolombo

Abstract = {This paper describes the design and performance of the search coil
   magnetometers (SCM), which are part of the Plasma Wave Investigation
   (PWI) instrument onboard the BepiColombo/Mio spacecraft (Mercury
   Magnetospheric Orbiter), which will measure the electric field, plasma
   waves and radio waves for the first time in Mercury's plasma
   environment. The SCM consists of two low-frequency orthogonal search
   coil sensors (LF-SC) measuring two components of the magnetic field (0.1
   Hz - 20 kHz) in the spacecraft spin plane, and a dual-band search coil
   sensor (DB-SC) picking up the third component along the spin axis at
   both low-frequencies (LF: 0.1 Hz - 20 kHz) and high-frequencies (HF: 10
   kHz - 640 kHz). The DB-SC and the two LF-SC sensors form a tri-axial
   configuration at the tip of a 4.6-m coilable mast (MAST-SC) extending
   from the spacecraft body, to minimize artificial magnetic field
   contamination emitted by the spacecraft electronics. After the
   successful launch of the spacecraft on 20 October 2018, an initial
   function check for the SCM was conducted. The nominal function and
   performance of the sensors and preamplifiers were confirmed, even with
   the MAST-SC being retracted and stowed in the spacecraft body, resulting
   in the detection of large interference signals likely from spacecraft
   electronics. The MAST-SC is scheduled for deployment after the Mercury
   orbit insertion of Mio in 2025, allowing the SCM to make the first
   higher frequency measurements of magnetic fluctuations in the Hermean
   magnetosphere and exosphere, and the local solar wind. These
   measurements will contribute to the investigation of fundamental
   problems in the Hermean plasma environment, including turbulence,
   magnetic reconnection, wave-particle interactions and particle
   acceleration.},

Abstract = {This synthesis paper summarizes published proxy climate evidence showing
   the spatial and temporal pattern of climate change through the Holocene
   in Arctic Canada and Greenland. Our synthesis includes 47 records from a
   recently published database of highly resolved Holocene paleoclimate
   time series from the Arctic (Sundqvist et al., 2014). We analyze the
   temperature histories represented by the database and compare them with
   paleoclimate and environmental information from 54 additional published
   records, mostly from datasets that did not fit the selection criteria
   for the Arctic Holocene database. Combined, we review evidence from a
   variety of proxy archives including glaciers (ice cores and glacial
   geomorphology), lake sediments, peat sequences, and coastal and
   deep-marine sediments. The temperature-sensitive records indicate more
   consistent and earlier Holocene warmth in the north and east, and a more
   diffuse and later Holocene thermal maximum in the south and west.
   Principal components analysis reveals two dominant Holocene trends, one
   with early Holocene warmth followed by cooling in the middle Holocene,
   the other with a broader period of warmth in the middle Holocene
   followed by cooling in the late Holocene. The temperature decrease from
   the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0 +/- 1.0
   degrees C on average (n = 11 sites). The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted
   to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka, consistent with many sites
   from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions
   around that time. The spatial pattern of temperature change through the
   Holocene was likely driven by the decrease in northern latitude summer
   insolation through the Holocene, the varied influence of waning ice
   sheets in the early Holocene, and the variable influx of Atlantic Water
   into the study region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Negotiating Exclusion: MSM, Identity, and Blood Policy in the Age of

Abstract = {In the US, blood donors face a variety of restrictions that leave many
   people excluded entirely from the donor pool. This paper explores the
   specific circumstances and meanings surrounding the donor ban on
   Men-who-have-Sex-with-Men (MSM). The ban on MSM is one of the few
   existing donor guidelines to receive considerable criticism on grounds
   that it effectively prohibits any sexually active gay man from donating
   blood and thus discriminates against gays. Due in part to these
   questions of fairness, the Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) of
   the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) met to reconsider the decades-old
   policy, first in 1997 and again in 2000. The FDA asked its advisory
   committee to address the efficacy and utility of the MSM ban in light of
   technological developments in blood-banking, epidemiological data on the
   spread of HIV, and mounting pressures from gay rights and blood-banking
   organizations to update the policy. Through a detailed reading of
   meeting and conference transcripts that took place between 1997 and
   2000, I argue that `MSM' became a contested definitional category during
   the FDA's reappraisal of the policy. During and between the Committee's
   discussions, presenters and experts debated the differences between
   sexual behavior and sexual identity in relation to HIV and, eventually,
   HHV-8, a virus known to cause Kaposi's sarcoma in immuno-suppressed
   individuals. I argue that the underlying flexibility in the meanings
   behind the term `MSM' allowed Committee members, in the end, to retract
   their more nuanced discussions of human behavior and HIV and to uphold
   the contested policy. Finally, I suggest how the debates surrounding the
   MSM donor ban can help us to better understand the place of sexuality in
   discussions and claims of biopolitical citizenship in early 21st-century
   America.},

Title = {Iterative flattening search for resource constrained scheduling},

   Planning and Scheduling Problems, Providence, RI, SEP 23, 2007},
Abstract = {Iterative flattening search (ifs) is a meta-heuristic strategy for
   solving multi-capacity scheduling problems. Given an initial solution,
   ifs iteratively applies: (1) a relaxation-step, in which a subset of
   scheduling decisions are randomly retracted from the current solution;
   and (2) a flattening-step, in which a new solution is incrementally
   recomputed from this partial schedule. Whenever a better solution is
   found, it is retained, and, upon termination, the best solution found
   during the search is returned. Prior research has shown ifs to be an
   effective and scalable heuristic procedure for minimizing schedule
   makespan in multi-capacity resource settings. In this paper we
   experimentally investigate the impact on ifs performance of algorithmic
   variants of the flattening step. The variants considered are
   distinguished by different computational requirements and
   correspondingly vary in the type and depth of search performed. The
   analysis is centered around the idea that given a time bound to the
   overall optimization procedure, the ifs optimization process is driven
   by two different and contrasting mechanisms: the random sampling
   performed by iteratively applying the ``relaxation/flattening{''} cycle
   and the search conducted within the constituent flattening procedure. On
   one hand, one might expect that efficiency of the flattening process is
   key: the faster the flattening procedure, the greater the number of
   iterations (and number of sampled solutions) for a given time bound; and
   hence the greater the probability of finding better quality solutions.
   On the other hand, the use of more accurate (and more costly) flattening
   procedures can increase the probability of obtaining better quality
   solutions even if their greater computational cost reduces the number of
   ifs iterations. Comparative results on well-studied benchmark problems
   are presented that clarify this tradeoff with respect to previously
   proposed flattening strategies, identify qualitative guidelines for the
   design of effective ifs procedures, and suggest some new directions for
   future work in this area.},

Title = {Development of a Quality Risk Based Tool for the Selection of Regulatory
   Starting Materials for Commercial Drug Substance Manufacturing Processes},

Abstract = {The selection of regulatory starting materials (RSMs) is a critical step
   in determining where the drug substance manufacturing process begins as
   it relates to the submission and approval of the commercial marketing
   application and with it the formal expectations for Good Manufacturing
   Practice (GMP) processing. The determination of RSMs can be very
   challenging and is often subject to significant debate both within
   pharmaceutical manufacturing organizations and with regulatory bodies
   that review the commercial marketing application. The use of quality
   risk management (QRM) as described in ICH Q9 can help provide a process
   for assessing the RSM attributes and their relationship to the critical
   quality attributes (CQAs) of both the final drug substance and the drug
   product. This publication presents a standardized risk assessment tool
   developed by Merck \& Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (MSD) that
   facilitates the RSM decision-making process on the basis of principles
   described in ICH Q10 and ICH Q11. The MSD RSM tool was designed to take
   into account the current regulatory landscape, evolved over time as the
   landscape dictates, while providing a systematic evaluation of the
   suitability of proposed RSMs to enable their judicious selection. The
   MSD RSM tool can be used for new chemical entities (NCEs) submitted for
   commercial approval or for in-line products going through postapproval
   changes. The MSD RSM tool provides a total score that is used to assess
   the alignment with the starting material selection principles in ICH Q11
   and the EMA reflection paper, which was retracted by EMA after the ICH
   Q11 Q\&A was issued. The level of alignment should generally correspond
   with the likelihood that an RSM will be accepted by regulatory agencies
   in the commercial marketing application.},

Title = {Development of a Morphing Landing Gear Composite Door for High Speed
   Compound Rotorcraft},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In the framework of fast rotorcraft, smoothness and flushness of
   external aerodynamic surfaces present challenges for high-speed
   conditions, where aerodynamics is the driver of helicopter performance.
   For AIRBUS-RACER helicopter the main landing gear trap doors are parts
   of the lower wing skins (in retracted configuration) affecting
   helicopter performance by minimizing the drag. Flushness requirements
   must not be in contrast with the functionally of the Landing gear system
   that must open and close the doors during the landing gear
   retraction-extension phases at moderately low velocity. To manage these
   goals, a novel design logic has been identified to support the trap
   doors development phase. The identified way to proceed needs of relevant
   numerical method and tool as well. This method is aimed at identifying
   the main landing gear composite compartment doors in pre-shaped
   configuration to match the smoothness and door-stopper engagements over
   each aerodynamic conditions. The authors propose a detailed non-linear
   Finite Element method, based on MSC Nastran (MSC Software, Newport
   Beach, US) SOL-400 solver in which the structure is modelled with
   deformable contact bodies in a multiple load step sequence, open door
   condition and pre-shaped, deformed under actuator pre-load, under flight
   load conditions. The method includes the entire pre-stressed field due
   to the preload and the actual door stiffness, considering the achieved
   large displacement to verify the most representative strain field during
   loads application. The paper defines a robust methodology to predict the
   deformation and ensure the most appropriate door ``pre-bow{''} and
   pre-load, in order to achieve the desiderated structural shape that
   matches aerodynamic requirements. The main result is the identification
   of a pre-shaped doors configuration for the Airbus RACER Fast
   Rotorcraft.},

Title = {Gradient static-strain stimulation in a microfluidic chip for 3D
   cellular alignment},
Journal = {LAB ON A CHIP},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {482-493},
Abstract = {Cell alignment is a critical factor to govern cellular behavior and
   function for various tissue engineering applications ranging from
   cardiac to neural regeneration. In addition to physical geometry, strain
   is a crucial parameter to manipulate cellular alignment for functional
   tissue formation. In this paper, we introduce a simple approach to
   generate a range of gradient static strains without external mechanical
   control for the stimulation of cellular behavior within 3D biomimetic
   hydrogel microenvironments. A glass-supported microfluidic chip with a
   convex flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane on the top was
   employed for loading the cells suspended in a prepolymer solution.
   Following UV crosslinking through a photomask with a concentric circular
   pattern, the cell-laden hydrogels were formed in a height gradient from
   the center (maximum) to the boundary (minimum). When the convex PDMS
   membrane retracted back to a flat surface, it applied compressive
   gradient forces on the cell-laden hydrogels. The concentric circular
   hydrogel patterns confined the direction of hydrogel elongation, and the
   compressive strain on the hydrogel therefore resulted in elongation
   stretch in the radial direction to guide cell alignment. NIH3T3 cells
   were cultured in the chip for 3 days with compressive strains that
   varied from similar to 65\% (center) to similar to 15\% (boundary) on
   hydrogels. We found that the hydrogel geometry dominated the cell
   alignment near the outside boundary, where cells aligned along the
   circular direction, and the compressive strain dominated the cell
   alignment near the center, where cells aligned radially. This study
   developed a new and simple approach to facilitate cellular alignment
   based on hydrogel geometry and strain stimulation for tissue engineering
   applications. This platform offers unique advantages and is
   significantly different from the existing approaches owing to the fact
   that gradient generation was accomplished in a miniature device without
   using an external mechanical source.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Obesity Disparities Research},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Context: A review of interventions addressing obesity disparities could
   reveal gaps in the literature and provide guidance on future research,
   particularly for populations with a high prevalence of obesity and
   obesity-related cardiometabolic risk.
   Evidence acquisition: A systematic review of clinical trials in obesity
   disparities research that were published in 2011-2016 in PubMed/MEDLINE
   resulted in 328 peer-reviewed articles. Articles were excluded if they
   had no BMI, weight, or body composition measure as primary outcome or
   were foreign (n=201); were epidemiologic or secondary data analyses of
   clinical trials (n=12); design or protocol papers (n=54); systematic
   reviews (n=3); or retracted or duplicates (n=9). Forty-nine published
   trials were summarized and supplemented with a review of ongoing obesity
   disparities grants being funded by the National, Heart, Lung and Blood
   Institute.
   Evidence synthesis: Of the 49 peer-reviewed trials, 27 targeted adults
   and 22 children only or parent-child dyads (5 of 22). Interventions were
   individually focused; mostly in single settings (e.g., school or
   community); of short duration (mostly <= 12 months); and primarily used
   behavioral modification (e.g., self-monitoring) strategies. Many of the
   trials had small sample sizes and moderate to high attrition rates. A
   meta-analysis of 13 adult trials obtained a pooled intervention effect
   of BMI -1.31 (95\% CI = -2.11, -0.52, p=0.0012). Institutional review
   identified 140 ongoing obesity-related health disparities grants, but
   only 19\% (n=27) were clinical trials.
   Conclusions: The reviews call for cardiovascular-related obesity
   disparities research that is long term and includes population research,
   and multilevel, policy, and environmental, or ``whole of
   community,{''}interventions. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Abstract = {Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous
   publications of imaging findings in children have surfaced in a very
   short time. Publications discuss populations of overlapping age groups
   and describe different imaging patterns. We aim to present an overview
   of the quantity and type of literature available regarding COVID-19
   chest imaging findings in children according to a 2020 publication
   timeline. We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We
   searched terminology related to COVID-19, chest, children and imaging
   modalities in PubMed and Embase. The included papers were published
   online in 2020 and described imaging findings specific to children and
   reported five or more cases. Two researchers reviewed each abstract to
   determine inclusion or exclusion, and a radiologist reconciled any
   disagreements. Then we reviewed full articles for the main analysis.
   Eligible study designs included original articles, case series (>= 5
   cases), systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We excluded non-English
   manuscripts, retracted articles, and those without available full text.
   The remaining articles were distributed to four pediatric radiologists
   (on the Society for Pediatric Radiology Thoracic Committee), who
   summarized chest imaging findings. Eighty-two articles were included in
   the final analysis - 28\% in radiology journals and 71\% in
   non-radiology journals; 71\% contained original data and 29\% were
   review-style papers. There was a disproportionate contribution of
   review-style papers in April (55\%), considering the paucity of
   preceding publications with original data in March (5 papers). June had
   the highest number of publications (n=14), followed by April (n=11) and
   July (n=11). Most (52\%) original papers were from China and most
   individual pediatric imaging descriptions were from China (57\%), while
   the majority of review papers (83\%) were international. Imaging
   descriptions were available for 2,199 children (1,678 CT descriptions
   and 780 chest radiography descriptions). Findings included a 25\% normal
   CT scan reports vs. 40\% normal chest radiography reports. Ground-glass
   opacification was the most common CT finding (33\%) and was reported in
   only a minority of chest radiographs (9\%). A significant amount of
   information on pediatric COVID-19 chest imaging has become rapidly
   available over a short period. Most publications in 2020 were original
   articles, but they were published more often in non-radiology journals.
   A disproportionate number of review articles were published early on and
   were based on little original pediatric imaging data. CT scan reports,
   which represent the standard, outnumbered radiographic reports and
   indicated that ground-glass opacification is the main imaging finding
   and that only a quarter of scans are normal in children with COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Visualization experimental investigation on the phenomena and dynamic
   behavior of coalescence between two equal-size water drops on inclined
   surfaces is reported in this paper. The effects of inclination angle of
   the surface and drop size on the dynamics of liquid bridge, fore/back
   contact angle and triple-phase contact line of the coalescent drop are
   discussed. The results show that highly concave interface around the
   liquid bridge and highly convex interface at the retracted top-side
   parts of two drops built surface tension gradient to drive the interior
   liquid flow in early stage of the coalescence, while changeable surface
   tension gradient between highly convex interface at the forepart and
   near flattened inter-face at the back part of the coalescent drop and
   adverse gravity induced the interior flow and the oscillation process
   later. Coalescence promoted the motion of the coalescent drop on the
   inclined surface. The released surface energy and potential energy
   compensated the internal viscous dissipation and the friction, and the
   fraction for friction increased with increasing inclination angle and
   drop size. For coalescence of small drops on the inclined surface, the
   triple-phase contact line, liquid bridge radius and fore/back contact
   angle of the coalescent drop behaved as periodic damped oscillations.
   Larger inclination angle of the surface induced severe oscillations for
   the displacement of back-end and fore contact angle of the coalescent
   drop while subdued oscillations for the displacement of front-end and
   back contact angle as well as higher frequency and smaller amplitude for
   liquid bridge radius. For large drops coalescence, the displacements of
   front-end and back-end monotonously increased, the liquid bridge radius
   reduced rapidly without oscillation after passing through a peak value,
   and the fore/back contact angle increased/decreased quickly with slight
   oscillation to reach a stable value. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc, All rights

Title = {Failure analysis of a collapsed flat gymnasium roof},
Journal = {ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {104-113},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {A 1300 m(2) flat roof of a three year-old gymnasium collapsed in the
   early morning of a winter day, fortunately before the opening hours.
   The snow load was rather high, but still considerably below the design
   limit. Therefore, the snow could only be the trigger of the collapse.
   The visual findings, material tests and norm conformity checks pointed
   towards the buckling of the girder's stiffener-less web at its supported
   ends to be the root failure cause. However, relevant contributions of
   other structural deficiencies still could not be excluded. In order to
   prove the ``buckling-hypothesis{''}, the optimistic-realistic ultimate
   resistance of the girders had to be determined and compared with the
   reconstructed loads acting at the moment of the failure.
   The present paper focuses on the calculation of the ultimate resistance
   of the girder's ends including the non-linear post-buckling process. The
   procedure consists of a concerted two-stage combination of linear and
   nonlinear finite element analyses. A sensitivity analysis regarding the
   girder's initial geometrical imperfection and the consideration of the
   real elastic-plastic material behavior were essential to obtain the
   adequate range of the girder's ultimate resistance.
   Based on the quantitative results, the girder's web buckling under the
   regular service load due to lack of stiffeners could be proven as the
   root cause of the accident. The conclusion is supported additionally by
   the consistency between the retracted collapse and the characteristic
   visual findings.
   The presented case study demonstrates the importance of finding the
   realistic-optimistic load carrying capacity when proving a corresponding
   failure hypothesis. This required a different approach compared to the
   stage of design in terms of appropriate assumptions and accuracy. (C)

Abstract = {The welded joints of dissimilar metals find numerous applications in the
   field of automobiles, marine, nuclear energy, construction, aerospace.
   The dissimilar metal welding has lower weld efficiency until the
   emergence of the Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) process. The process is
   termed as cold since the heat input is low when compared to the
   conventional MIG process. This process uses a principle called
   `short-circuiting,' where the feed wire is retracted when the liquid
   droplet falls from the welding wire to the substrate. The retraction is
   done by the electronic regulators of the robot arm of the process, and
   the arc is reignited when the liquid droplet is fully transferred to the
   substrate. This paper is based on the different characteristics,
   microstructure and mechanical properties exhibited by the dissimilar
   metal welded joints joined by using the CMT process. Discussions were
   limited to titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, copper and magnesium
   joints. Welding was performed with optimum parameters of CMT and the
   results were analysed. Due to the super low heat input of the CMT
   welding process, rapid heating and cooling was realized. Titanium and
   stainless steel joint fetched a maximum tensile strength of 318 MPa with
   the ductility of 8.5\%. Magnesium with Aluminium joints produced a max
   strength of 230 MPa and was high towards the magnesium side and lowered
   towards the aluminium side. Minimum diffusion layer and changes in the
   diffusion zones of Al-HAZ and Mg interfaces are observed. The diffusion
   of the Al matrix was found to be high. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {A Closed-Loop Dynamic Controller for Active Vibration Isolation Working
   on A Parallel Wheel-Legged Robot},
Journal = {CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Serving the Stewart mechanism as a wheel-legged structure, the most
   outstanding superiority of the proposed wheel-legged hybrid robot (WLHR)
   is the active vibration isolation function during rolling on rugged
   terrain. However, it is difficult to obtain its precise dynamic model,
   because of the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the heavy robot. This
   paper presents a dynamic control framework with a decentralized
   structure for single wheel-leg, position tracking based on model
   predictive control (MPC) and adaptive impedance module from inside to
   outside. Through the Newton-Euler dynamic model of the Stewart
   mechanism, the controller first creates a predictive model by combining
   Newton-Raphson iteration of forward kinematic and inverse kinematic
   calculation of Stewart. The actuating force naturally enables each strut
   to stretch and retract, thereby realizing six degrees-of-freedom
   (6-DOFs) position-tracking for Stewart wheel-leg. The adaptive impedance
   control in the outermost loop adjusts environmental impedance parameters
   by current position and force feedback of wheel-leg along Z-axis. This
   adjustment allows the robot to adequately control the desired support
   force tracking, isolating the robot body from vibration that is
   generated from unknown terrain. The availability of the proposed control
   methodology on a physical prototype is demonstrated by tracking a Bezier
   curve and active vibration isolation while the robot is rolling on
   decelerate strips. By comparing the proportional and integral (PI) and
   constant impedance controllers, better performance of the proposed
   algorithm was operated and evaluated through displacement and force
   sensors internally-installed in each cylinder, as well as an inertial
   measurement unit (IMU) mounted on the robot body. The proposed algorithm
   structure significantly enhances the control accuracy and vibration
   isolation capacity of parallel wheel-legged robot.},

Title = {At which magnetic field, exactly, does the Kondo resonance begin to
   split? A Fermi liquid description of the low-energy properties of the
   Anderson model},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {98},
Number = {7},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {This paper is a corrected version of Phys. Rev. B 95, 165404 (2017),
   which we have retracted because it contained a trivial but fatal sign
   error that lead to incorrect conclusions. We extend a recently developed
   Fermi liquid (FL) theory for the asymmetric single-impurity Anderson
   model {[}C. Mora et al., Phys. Rev. B 92, 075120 (2015)] to the case of
   an arbitrary local magnetic field. To describe the system's low-lying
   quasiparticle excitations for arbitrary values of the bare Hamiltonian's
   model parameters, we construct an effective low-energy FL Hamiltonian
   whose FL parameters are expressed in terms of the local level's
   spin-dependent ground-state occupations and their derivatives with
   respect to level energy and local magnetic field. These quantities are
   calculable with excellent accuracy from the Bethe ansatz solution of the
   Anderson model. Applying this effective model to a quantum dot in a
   nonequilibrium setting, we obtain exact results for the curvature of the
   spectral function, c(A), describing its leading similar to epsilon(2)
   term, and the transport coefficients c(V) and c(T), describing the
   leading similar to V-2 and similar to T-2 terms in the nonlinear
   differential conductance. A sign change in c(A) or c(V) is indicative of
   a change from a local maximum to a local minimum in the spectral
   function or nonlinear conductance, respectively, as is expected to occur
   when an increasing magnetic field causes the Kondo resonance to split
   into two subpeaks. We find that the fields B-A, B-T, and By at which
   c(A), c(T), and c(V) change sign, respectively, are all of order T-K, as
   expected, with B-A = B-T = B-V = 0.75073T(K) in the Kondo limit.},

Title = {Can intensified forestry be responsible for changes in habitat usage by

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Populations of the internationally protected Black Stork Ciconia nigra
   in the northern parts of the distribution range, located to the east of
   the Baltic Sea, have suffered decline over recent decades. Since early
   1990s, however, logging intensity has increased. In this paper,
   considering a ten-year period from the mid-1990s, we ask: (a) Did
   changes occur in the habitat preferred by Black Stork in the decade? (b)
   did the decade of intensified forestry significantly change forest
   characteristics? and (c) could the intensified forestry explain any
   observed changes in the utilization of habitat by storks? We compared
   forest characteristics at the beginning and end of this period at 75
   random points and compared the habitat at 75 nest sites occupied by the
   Black Stork in the mid-1990s and 75 occupied nest sites at the end of
   the 2000s. In the 0.7-km zones around the random points, the abundance
   of mature stands decreased between the mid-1990s and the end of the
   2000s, as did the abundance of broadleaved trees, but black alders
   increased. Nevertheless, the age and composition of tree species within
   the stands around the random points remained similar. Some changes were
   noted though in the habitat around nests used by Black Storks during two
   periods, with the data indicating that the Black Storks tended to occupy
   sites of better habitat quality (e.g. with a higher density of
   hydrological network and old oak trees, older nest stands) at the end of
   the 2000s than in the mid-1990s. Our results, however, do not support
   the idea that intensified forestry over the short term induced changes
   in the habitat used by the Black Storks. It is possible that nesting
   Black Storks became concentrated into the prime habitat when population
   retracted and/or abandoned habitat where recently recovered by the
   White-tailed Eagle.},

Title = {Time-Varying Aeroelastic Modeling and Analysis of a Rapidly Morphing
   Wing},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Advanced rotational variable-swept missile wings require the ability to
   rapidly deploy, retract and reach the designated position. Therefore,
   the establishment of an effective time-varying aeroelastic model of a
   rotating missile wing is the prerequisite for performing transient
   response analysis during the rapid morphing process. In this paper, the
   finite element model of the wing at the fixed configuration is combined
   with the floating frame method to describe the small elastic
   deformations and large rigid-body displacements of the wing,
   respectively. Combining the structural dynamic model with the supersonic
   piston theory, a nonlinear and time-varying aeroelastic model of a
   missile wing undergoing the rapid morphing process is established. A
   method for the real-time determination of the time-varying lifting
   surface during morphing is discussed. Based on the proposed aeroelastic
   equations of motion, the flutter characteristics of the wing at
   different sweep angles are obtained. The influences of the actuator
   spring constant, the damping ratio during the morphing and the post-lock
   stages, as well as the velocity quadratic term in the aeroelastic
   equations, on the transient responses of the system are studied. The
   simulation results show that the flutter characteristics of the wing are
   greatly influenced by the sweep angle. Moreover, the jumping phenomenon
   in flutter speed due to the switching of flutter modes is found with the
   increase of the sweep angle. The morphing simulations demonstrate that
   the transient aeroelastic responses mainly occur in the post-lock stage,
   so much more attention needs to be focused on the post-lock vibrations.
   In addition, under the given simulation parameters, the nonlinear
   quadratic velocity term has little effect on the transient responses of
   the system. This study provides an efficient method for predicting the
   transient aeroelastic responses of a rotational variable swept wing.},

Title = {Dorsal Consonant Harmony in Truku Seediq},

Abstract = {Seediq is a Formosan language belonging to the Atayalic subgroup (Li
   1981). This paper reports a (morpho-)phonological process called dorsal
   consonant harmony found in the language with the data based on the Truku
   dialect. Two contrastive segments-voiceless velar stop /k/ and voiceless
   uvular stop /q/-are involved, and the latter is derived in
   morphophonemic contexts. This process operates not only between morpheme
   boundaries, but also within morpheme roots, showing that the {*}/k...q/
   sequence is unattested, and only very few /q...k/ sequences are found.
   However, with the introduction of a rule which changes labials to velars
   in word-final position, this root-internal restriction is gradually
   loosened (cf. Li 1980). An observation of the data also reveals that
   heteromorphemic alternation of dorsal consonant harmony involves both
   derivational and inflectional prefixes; hence it is controlled by fixed
   right-to-left directionality. Theoretically speaking, this assimilation
   process is considered as a non-local correspondence rather than a
   spreading of the dorsal feature {[}high] or {[}retracted tongue root]
   (cf. Hansson 2001), since the intervening oral segments are transparent
   to the operation without any opacity effect, i.e. the intervening vowels
   are lowered only if immediately adjacent to a uvular. A theoretical
   interpretation is provided following the model of contrastive hierarchy
   in phonology (Dresher 2003, Mackenzie 2005) and feature specifications
   of both segments, suggesting that the segment /q/ in this language
   possesses double domination (McCarthy 1994) in both oral and pharyngeal
   cavities, thus enforcing the harmony of a hetero-morphemic /k/ in order
   to ease production difficulties. A similar morpheme-internal harmony is
   also mentioned in other Atayalic dialects such as Squliq and Skikun (Li
   1980). A diachronic implication gained from this observation is that
   dorsal consonant harmony is probably a pan-Atayalic phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high potential for enhancing
   training in many tasks, especially those that require maintaining high
   levels of concentration such as surgery. Training focus and attention
   can play a critical role in surgery since concentration on the task at
   hand is fundamental to prevent life-threatening errors. In this paper we
   propose a new method for concentration training in the context of
   robot-assisted laser microsurgery associated to a feedback design that
   makes the interaction more intuitive. This approach couples augmented
   reality (AR) features to both BCI-based on-line measurement of the
   user's mental focus and the control of the surgical robot. The
   methodology is described as a brain-controlled augmented reality (BcAR)
   training system. AR is used to maintain the surgeon's perceptual contact
   with the real operating setting, while focus stimulation is provided by
   modifying features of an AR item based on real-time monitoring of the
   user's mental state. In this research a low-cost EEG device is used and
   the BcAR is implemented in the form of an AR scalpel that behaves as a
   ``retractable{''} knife according to the user's mental focus: low
   concentration levels retract the knife and prevent cutting. This design
   provides directional compatibility between the AR feedback animation and
   the spontaneous motion of user's attention along the AR tool, resulting
   in an intuitive system with real impact on the training outcome. This is
   demonstrated through user trials and comparison with training based on
   simple AR feedback (no EEG). Results demonstrate the potential of the
   approach, showing a significant improvement in post-training task
   execution time without any detriment to user experience. Subjective
   questionnaires also confirmed the critical role of directional
   compatibility in the AR feedback. Such findings allow the identification
   of further improvements and novel potential applications of this
   interaction paradigm.},

Title = {Nonlinear Behavior of High-Intensity Ultrasound Propagation in an Ideal
   Fluid},
Journal = {ACOUSTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},

Pages = {147-163},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper, nonlinearity associated with intense ultrasound is
   studied by using the one-dimensional motion of nonlinear shock wave in
   an ideal fluid. In nonlinear acoustics, the wave speed of different
   segments of a waveform is different, which causes distortion in the
   waveform and can result in the formation of a shock (discontinuity).
   Acoustic pressure of high-intensity waves causes particles in the ideal
   fluid to vibrate forward and backward, and this disturbance is of
   relatively large magnitude due to high-intensities, which leads to
   nonlinearity in the waveform. In this research, this vibration of fluid
   due to the intense ultrasonic wave is modeled as a fluid pushed by one
   complete cycle of piston. In a piston cycle, as it moves forward, it
   causes fluid particles to compress, which may lead to the formation of a
   shock (discontinuity). Then as the piston retracts, a forward-moving
   rarefaction, a smooth fan zone of continuously changing pressure,
   density, and velocity is generated. When the piston stops at the end of
   the cycle, another shock is sent forward into the medium. The variation
   in wave speed over the entire waveform is calculated by solving a
   Riemann problem. This study examined the interaction of shocks with a
   rarefaction. The flow field resulting from these interactions shows that
   the shock waves are attenuated to a Mach wave, and the pressure
   distribution within the flow field shows the initial wave is dissipated.
   The developed theory is applied to waves generated by 20 KHz, 500 KHz,
   and 2 MHz transducers with 50, 150, 500, and 1500 W power levels to
   explore the effect of frequency and power on the generation and decay of
   shock waves. This work enhances the understanding of the interactions of
   high-intensity ultrasonic waves with fluids.},

Title = {Basin-wide Holocene environmental changes in the marginal area of the
   Asian monsoon, northwest China},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {203-212},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In arid regions, because of spatial variability, using single climate
   records is difficult to reconstruct the past climate change for the
   drainage basins. Holocene environmental records were collected from the
   upper, middle and lower regions of the Shiyang River drainage basin in
   the marginal area of the Asian monsoon (northwest China). The main
   objective of this paper was to compare the records from the terminal
   lake and the middle and upper reaches of the basin to study the
   basin-wide environmental changes. During the early Holocene the
   vegetation was sparse, and the effective moisture was relatively low in
   the basin. The Holocene Climatic Optimum started between 7.0 and 8.0 cal
   ka BP, during which the lake level reached the highest level in the
   terminal lake; the vegetation density and the effective moisture reached
   the highest level during the Holocene in the drainage basin. From 4.7
   cal ka BP the terminal lake began to shrink, while the vegetation
   density decreased dramatically. In the middle and upper regions of the
   drainage, the effective moisture began to decrease since 3.5 cal ka BP,
   and the arid tendency was earlier in the terminal lake than it was in
   the middle and upper regions of the drainage basin. During the early
   Holocene the relatively arid environment was affected by the gradually
   intensifying East Asian monsoon and the dry westerly winds. The
   mid-Holocene Optimum benefited from the intensive East Asian monsoon and
   the humid westerly winds. Then, the East Asian monsoon retreated since
   the late-Holocene. In the basin the arid tendency may be related to the
   retracting of the East Asian monsoon. However, the intensifying
   acidification after 1.5 cal ka BP may be correlated to the increasing
   dryness of the westerly winds.},

Title = {The topology of the space of symplectic balls in rational 4-manifolds},

Volume = {122},

Abstract = {We study in this paper the rational homotopy type of the space of
   symplectic embeddings of the standard ball B-4 (c) subset of R-4 into
   4-dimensional rational symplectic manifolds, where c = pi r(2) is the
   capacity of the standard ball of radius r. We compute the rational
   homotopy groups of that space when the 4-manifold has the form M-mu =
   (S-2 x S-2, muomega(0) circle plus omega(0)), where omega(0) is the area
   form on the sphere with total area I and mu belongs to the interval
   {[}1, 2]. We show that, when mu is 1, this space retracts to the space
   of symplectic frames for any value of c. However, for any given 1 < p
   less than or equal to 2, the rational homotopy type of that space
   changes as c crosses the critical parameter lambda = mu - 1, which is
   the difference of areas between the two S-2-factors. We prove, moreover,
   that the full homotopy type of that space changes only at that value,
   that is that the restriction map between these spaces is a homotopy
   equivalence as long as these values of c remain either below or above
   that critical value. The same methods apply to all other values of p and
   other rational 4-manifolds as well. The methods rely on two different
   tools: the study of the action of symplectic groups on the stratified
   space of almost complex structures developed by Gromov, Abreu, and
   McDuff and the analysis of the relations between the group corresponding
   to a manifold M, the group corresponding to its blow-up (M) over tilde,
   and the space of symplectic embedded balls in M.},

Title = {Characteristics of Retractions from Korean Medical Journals in the
   KoreaMed Database: A Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Background
   Flawed or misleading articles may be retracted because of either honest
   scientific errors or scientific misconduct. This study explored the
   characteristics of retractions in medical journals published in Korea
   through the KoreaMed database.
   Methods
   We retrieved retraction articles indexed in the KoreaMed database from
   January 1990 to January 2016. Three authors each reviewed the details of
   the retractions including the reason for retraction, adherence to
   retraction guidelines, and appropriateness of retraction. Points of
   disagreement were reconciled by discussion among the three.
   Results
   Out of 217,839 articles in KoreaMed published from 1990 to January 2016,
   the publication type of 111 articles was retraction (0.051\%). Of the
   111 articles (addressing the retraction of 114 papers), 58.8\% were
   issued by the authors, 17.5\% were jointly issued (author, editor, and
   publisher), 15.8\% came from editors, and 4.4\% were dispatched by
   institutions; in 5.3\% of the instances, the issuer was unstated. The
   reasons for retraction included duplicate publication (57.0\%),
   plagiarism (8.8\%), scientific error (4.4\%), author dispute (3.5\%),
   and other (5.3\%); the reasons were unstated or unclear in 20.2\%. The
   degree of adherence to COPE's retraction guidelines varied
   (79.8\%-100\%), and some retractions were inappropriate by COPE
   standards. These were categorized as follows: retraction of the first
   published article in the case of duplicate publication (69.2\%),
   authorship dispute (15.4\%), errata (7.7\%), and other (7.7\%).
   Conclusion
   The major reason for retraction in Korean medical journals is duplicate
   publication. Some retractions resulted from overreaction by the editors.
   Therefore, editors of Korean medical journals should take careful note
   of the COPE retraction guidelines and should undergo training on
   appropriate retraction practices.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the as-built performance of MOSFIRE, the
   multi-object spectrometer and imager for the Cassegrain focus of the
   10-m Keck 1 telescope. MOSFIRE provides near-infrared (0.97 to 2.41 mu
   m) multi-object spectroscopy over a 6.1' x 6.1' field of view with a
   resolving power of R similar to 3,500 for a 0.7 `' (0.508 mm) slit (2.9
   pixels in the dispersion direction), or imaging over a field of view of
   similar to 6.9' diameter with similar to 0.18 `' per pixel sampling. A
   single diffraction grating can be set at two fixed angles, and
   order-sorting filters provide spectra that cover the K, H, J or Y bands
   by selecting 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th order respectively. A folding flat
   following the field lens is equipped with piezo transducers to provide
   tip/tilt control for flexure compensation at the <0.1 pixel level.
   Instead of fabricated focal plane masks requiring frequent cryo-cycling
   of the instrument, MOSFIRE is equipped with a cryogenic Configurable
   Slit Unit (CSU) developed in collaboration with the Swiss Center for
   Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM). Under remote control the CSU can
   form masks containing up to 46 slits with similar to 0.007-0.014 `'
   precision. Reconfiguration time is <6 minutes. Slits are formed by
   moving opposable bars from both sides of the focal plane. An individual
   slit has a length of 7.0 `' but bar positions can be aligned to make
   longer slits in increments of 7.5 `'. When masking bars are retracted
   from the field of view and the grating is changed to a mirror, MOSFIRE
   becomes a wide-field imager. The detector is a 2K x 2K H2-RG HgCdTe
   array from Teledyne Imaging Sensors with low dark current and low noise.
   Results from integration and commissioning are presented.},

Title = {HANDS: a multimodal dataset for modeling toward human grasp intent

Abstract = {Upper limb and hand functionality is critical to many activities of
   daily living, and the amputation of one can lead to significant
   functionality loss for individuals. From this perspective, advanced
   prosthetic hands of the future are anticipated to benefit from improved
   shared control between a robotic hand and its human user, but more
   importantly from the improved capability to infer human intent from
   multimodal sensor data to provide the robotic hand perception abilities
   regarding the operational context. Such multimodal sensor data may
   include various environment sensors including vision, as well as human
   physiology and behavior sensors including electromyography and inertial
   measurement units. A fusion methodology for environmental state and
   human intent estimation can combine these sources of evidence in order
   to help prosthetic hand motion planning and control. In this paper, we
   present a dataset of this type that was gathered with the anticipation
   of cameras being built into prosthetic hands, and computer vision
   methods will need to assess this hand-view visual evidence in order to
   estimate human intent. Specifically, paired images from human eye-view
   and hand-view of various objects placed at different orientations have
   been captured at the initial state of grasping trials, followed by
   paired video, EMG and IMU from the arm of the human during a grasp,
   lift, put-down, and retract style trial structure. For each trial, based
   on eye-view images of the scene showing the hand and object on a table,
   multiple humans were asked to sort in decreasing order of preference,
   five grasp types appropriate for the object in its given configuration
   relative to the hand. The potential utility of paired eye-view and
   hand-view images was illustrated by training a convolutional neural
   network to process hand-view images in order to predict eye-view labels
   assigned by humans.},

Abstract = {We present experimental and theoretical results for the conductance and
   mechanical properties of atom-sized wires between two metals. The
   experimental part is based on measurements with a scanning tunneling
   microscope (STM) where a point contact is created by indenting the tip
   into a gold surface. When the tip is retracted, a 10-20 Angstrom long
   nanowire is formed. Our measurements of the conductance of nanowires
   show clear signs of a quantization in units of 2e(2)/h. The scatter
   around the integer values increases considerably with the number of
   quanta, and typically it is not possible to observe more than up to four
   quanta in these experiments. A detailed discussion is given of the
   statistical methods used in the analysis of the experimental data. The
   theoretical part of the paper addresses some questions posed by the
   experiment: Why can conductance quantization be observed, what is the
   origin of the scatter in the experimental data, and what is the origin
   of the scaling of the scattering with the number of conductance quanta?
   The theoretical discussion is based on a free-electron-like model where
   scattering from the boundary of the nanowire is included. The
   configurations of the nanowires are deduced from molecular dynamics
   simulations, which also give information about the mechanical properties
   of the system. We show that such a model can account semiquantitatively
   for several of the observed effects. One of the main conclusions of the
   theoretical analysis is that,; due to the plastic deformation of the
   nanowires formed by the STM, the typical length scale of the variations
   in the shape of the boundary is not an atomic radius but rather bye
   times that value. This is the reason why scattering is sufficiently
   small to make conductance quantization observable by STM.},

Title = {A category of compositional domain-models for separable Stone spaces},

Abstract = {In this paper we introduce SFPM, a category of SFP domains which
   provides very satisfactory domain-models, i.e. ``partializations{''}, of
   separable Stone spaces (2-Stone spaces). More specifically, SFPM is a
   subcategory of SFPep, closed under direct limits as well as many
   constructors, such as lifting, sum, product and Plotkin powerdomain
   (with the notable exception of the function space constructor). SFPM is
   ``structurally well behaved{''}, in the sense that the functor MAX,
   which associates to each object of SFPM the Stone space of its maximal
   elements, is compositional with respect to the constructors above, and
   omega-continuous. A correspondence can be established between these
   constructors over SFPM and appropriate constructors on Stone spaces,
   whereby SFPM domain-models of Stone spaces defined as solutions of a
   vast class of recursive equations in SEPM, can be obtained simply by
   solving the corresponding equations in SFPM. Moreover any continuous
   function between two 2-Stone spaces can be extended to a continuous
   function between any two SFPM domain-models of the original spaces. The
   category SFPM does not include all the SFP's with a 2-Stone space of
   maximal elements (CSFP's). We show that the CSFP's can be characterized
   precisely as suitable retracts of SFPM objects. Then the results proved
   for SFPM easily extends to the wider category having CSFP's as objects.
   Using SFPM we can provide a plethora of ``partializations{''} of the
   space of finitary hypersets (the hyperuniverse N-omega. (Ann. New York
   Acad. Sci. 806 (1996) 140). These includes the classical ones proposed
   in Abramsky (A Cook's tour of the finitary non-well-founded sets
   unpublished manuscript, 1988; Inform. Comput. 92(2) (1991) 161) and
   Mislove et al. (Inform. Comput. 93(1) (1991) 16), which are also shown
   to be non-isomorphic, thus providing a negative answer to a problem
   raised in Mislove et al. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The Tardiglacial of Portugal has been associated with the Magdalenian
   culture and lithic industries characterized by tool miniaturization, a
   diversity of microlith types, and the absence of a intentional blade
   production. The technological characterization, the chronology and the
   phasing of the Portuguese Magdalenian have been de-fined based on data
   recovered from open-air sites of the Estremadura region (Central
   Portugal). This paper presents an overview of the research undertaken
   over the last twenty-five years, including results from research and
   preventive archaeology fieldwork outside this region, namely in the Coa,
   Sabor and Vouga Valleys (northern Portugal), as well as in the Guadiana
   Valley and Algarve regions (southern Portugal). Our chronological
   boundaries are the Greenland Stadial 2-1b and the 8.2 ka event, from
   Early Magdalenian to Early Mesolithic. Regarding vegetation, deciduous
   Quercus underwent expansion during the warm phases of the Tardiglacial
   and retracted during cold ones, when pines increased. After the
   Solutrean, the faunal assemblages show a decrease in the variability of
   the represented species and an increase in fish, birds, small mammals
   and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).
   Concerning the cultural sequence, the Middle Magdalenian remains
   uncharacterised. After the Upper Magdalenian, and thenceforward, the use
   of local raw materials and of cores-on-flakes (burin or carinated
   endscraper type) for bladelet production gradually increased. In terms
   of lithic armatures typology, a four-stage sequence can be discerned: 1)
   Upper Magdalenian with axial points rather than backed bladelets, quite
   common in previous phases; 2) Final Magdalenian with an increase in the
   diversity of armature types; 3) Azilian with geometric microliths,
   curved backed points (Azilian points) and Malaurie points, and 4) Early
   Mesolithic without retouched bladelet tools or at best a persistence of
   Azilian armature types.
   There were some changes in the Palaeolithic rock art of the Douro basin
   between phase 3 (Final Magdalenian) and phase 4 (Late Azilian):
   figurative animal representations give place to animal depictions
   characterized by their geometrical bodies, often filled-in, and red deer
   becomes the best-represented animal.},

Title = {Historical Range, Current Distribution, and Conservation Status of the
   Swift Fox, Vulpes velox, in North America},

Abstract = {The Swift Fox (Vulpes velox) was once common in the shortgrass and
   mixed-grass prairies of the Great Plains of North America. The species'
   abundance declined and its distribution retracted following European
   settlement of the plains. By the late 1800s, the species had been
   largely extirpated from the northern portion of its historical range,
   and its populations were acutely depleted elsewhere. Swift Fox
   populations have naturally recovered somewhat since the 1950s, but
   overall abundance and distribution remain below historical levels. In a
   1995 assessment of the species' status under the US Endangered Species
   Act, the US Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that a designation of
   threatened or endangered was warranted, but the species was ``precluded
   from listing by higher listing priorities.{''} A major revelation of the
   1995 assessment was the recognition that information useful for
   determining population status was limited. Fundamental information was
   missing, including an accurate estimate of the species' distribution
   before European settlement and an estimate of the species' current
   distribution and trends. The objectives of this paper are to fill those
   gaps in knowledge. Historical records were compiled and, in combination
   with knowledge of the habitat requirements of the species, the
   historical range of the Swift Fox is estimated to be approximately 1.5
   million km(2). Using data collected between 2001 and 2006, the species'
   current distribution is estimated to be about 44\% of its historical
   range in the United States and 3\% in Canada. Under current land use,
   approximately 39\% of the species' historical range contains grassland
   habitats with very good potential for Swift Fox occupation and another
   10\% supports grasslands with characteristics that are less preferred
   (e.g., a sparse shrub component or taller stature) but still suitable.
   Additionally, land use on at least 25\% of the historical range supports
   dryland farming, which can be suitable for Swift Fox occupation. In the
   United States, approximately 52\% of highest quality habitats currently
   available are occupied by Swift Foxes.},

Abstract = {It will be considered whether it is possible to connect medieval thought
   of Czech reform preacher and theologian Jan Hus with deliberative
   arguments in contemporary deliberative theory of democracy and with
   concepts of ecumenical christianity extended into inter-religious,
   ecumenical dialogue which started to work in the 20.th century. The
   method used in this paper is critical hermeneutics, it means critical
   reading of chosen texts and arguments of Jan Hus and of texts and
   arguments of deliberative theoreticians and of texts and arguments of
   ecumenically oriented theologians and their mutual interpretative
   comparison. Jan Hus was a strong moral critic of medieval Catholic
   church. His main authorities were Jesus Christ, Scripture and the truth.
   He wanted to persuade the council of Catholic church in Constance and to
   reform then Catholic church. The council reduced his public audience
   into the question whether he would had been willing to retract his
   teaching or not. He refused it and was burnt at the stake in 1415. His
   story and work played the significant role in Czech reform christianity,
   later in Czech national revival, in spiritual and political life of new
   Czechoslovak republic, in communist propaganda as well as in dissident
   critique of communist regime. Nowadays it will be enquired his arguments
   from the point of deliberative arguments and from the point of the
   possibility of ecumenical Christian and inter-religious dialogue. We
   will deal with objections that there are some traces of intolerant
   dogmatic christianity in Hus thinking as well as in thinking of other
   medieval theologians and council fathers. The planned result of this
   research is not an apology of Jan Hus'thought, which was bound to
   western christianity, but the highlighting the dialogical features which
   can be found in Jan Hus theology and social critical practice, which
   play irreplaceable roles in deliberative arguments and which are
   necessary conditions for ecumenical and inter religious dialogue as well
   as for dialogue with unbelievers, other believers and members of other
   cultural or civilizational regions.},

Title = {Van der Waals interactions between silica spheres and metallic thin
   films created by e-beam evaporation},

Abstract = {The long-range and adhesion forces between a molecularly smooth silica
   sphere and a relatively smooth thin metallic film have been measured by
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) operating in contact mode. The majority of
   the dispersion force measurements have been done with root mean square
   (RMS) roughness of more than 10 nm. This paper investigates lower
   roughness to prove or disprove theory of the van der Waals force for
   irregularly distributed size of asperities. Metallic films of Cu, Al,
   and Ag were obtained by coating silicon wafers using an electron beam
   evaporation (e-beam) method. The e-beam deposition rates were within the
   range of 0.6-1.2 angstrom/s at vacuum pressures between 2 x 10(-6) and 3
   x 10(-6) mbar. The developed coatings had peak-to-peak distance ranges
   of 80-120 nm and 1-2 mu m. Long-range attractive forces were obtained
   from the extending portion of the force/distance curves measured between
   a silica particle attached to the AFM cantilever and the metallic film
   surface. Certain samples demonstrated an attractive force much larger
   than the theoretically calculated dispersion force, which we attribute
   to an electrostatic image force. For other samples, the extending curves
   were comparable with the theoretical dispersion forces, especially when
   the curves were shifted by a distance of 1.82 RMS. Adhesion forces were
   measured from the retracting portion of the force/distance curves. For
   peak-to-peak distance near 90 nm, films having an RMS roughness of 0.5-3
   nm displayed a force reduced by a factor of 3-40 from that predicted by
   theory. This effect of the surface roughness supports a DMT model for
   sample interaction at a single contact point after particle detachment.
   We also demonstrate the absence of any capillary forces under relative
   humidities up to 40\%. It was explained by the thickness of wetting film
   smaller than the peaks height. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The Extendable Draft Platform (EDP) is a deep draft, column stabilized
   platform with a deck box support for topsides and a single, deep draft
   heave plate that provides suitable motion characteristics to enable the
   use of dry tree top tensioned risers. The EDP can be fabricated with
   topsides installed on the deck box and commissioned quayside in a
   typical construction yard. With the columns in the retracted position,
   the EDP floats on its deck box and can be towed, in this configuration,
   to the location of interest. Once the EDP is transported to its final
   site, the columns and heave plate are lowered to their final operating
   draft. During the lowering sequence, the deck box and the lower hull
   become two relatively independent bodies, mechanically connected by
   chains that control the lowering of the columns and heave plate, and the
   guides between the deck box and the columns. This multi-body system is
   hydrodynamically coupled because of radiated and diffracted waves. The
   global performance analyses of the installation process (lowering of the
   lower hull) are carried out by three different methods. The first method
   is frequency-domain analysis by WAMIT and a frequency domain motion
   solver. In the frequency domain analysis, all the mechanical connections
   are modeled as linear springs. The second method is time-domain,
   partially coupled analysis using HARP/WINPOST. In this analysis, the off
   diagonal 6x6 hydrodynamic interactions are ignored. The last method is a
   time domain, fully coupled analysis using HARP/WINPOST. In this
   analysis, full 12x12 hydrodynamic interactions are considered. In the
   time domain analyses, the mechanical couplings between each column and
   deck box are modeled with linear springs and the chain connections are
   modeled with slender rods by using the nonlinear finite element method.
   This paper presents and compares analysis results based on the three
   methods for relative motions and loads between the deck box and the
   lower hull during the lowering of the columns and heave plate.},

Abstract = {HDD heads have various interaction modes with thermal asperities (TAs),
   and protection mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure the
   head-disk interaction (HDI) resulting from them is eliminated or
   minimized to the highest extent possible. We propose a method to reduce
   such head-disk interaction (HDI) during TA detection and classification
   by flying higher at low thermal fly-height control (TFC) power, which
   minimizes the interaction of the TA with the head. The key idea is to
   scan the head at higher fly height, but with higher ECS bias voltage. By
   mapping out these TAs and ensuring the head does not fly over them again
   to prevent HDI, the fly height can then be lowered, and the rest of the
   TA cluster can be scanned. Following this method iteratively, the entire
   TA cluster can be mapped out with minimal interaction with the head.
   Although this method entails an increase in the test time to detect and
   map all TAs, compared to detecting them with TFC being on, this can help
   improve the reliability of the drive by protecting the sensitive
   read/write elements especially for energy assisted recording from HDI.
   Other than track follow, TA interactions also occur when the head seeks
   across the tracks. Typical seek avoidance attempts to eliminate TA
   interaction during seeking, however it is not straightforward to
   determine which of the seek mechanism: TFC on during short seeks,
   retract/arrival during long seeks, interaction with high TAs (HTAs),
   whose height is more than the fly height of the head during long seeks
   with TFC off, or idle TA interaction causes the greatest HDI. Through
   theoretical analysis and experimental corroboration, this paper intends
   to rank the various modes of TA interaction, so by developing features
   for eliminating or minimizing them in that order could help bring the
   maximum benefit for achieving minimum lifetime reduction of the head due
   to such interaction.},

Title = {A vibration mode-based adhesion impulse characterization technique},
Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper a technique for the characterization of small impulses
   produced by adhesion force is described. The need to address this topic
   arose in the frame of the ground testing of a space mechanism dedicated
   to the precise injection of a body into a geodesic trajectory, both as a
   reference for the spacecraft navigation and for a scientific
   measurement. The experimental facility consists of a proof mass
   suspended by a simple pendulum, and a second actuated body which can be
   moved and quickly retracted from the adhesive contact. At the
   retraction, the motion of the proof mass is measured to estimate the
   impulse (and its time duration) produced by the adhesive bonds arose
   between the two bodies, up to separation. In the current set-up,
   systematic effects (elastic energy stored in the system), structural
   vibration modes and measurement noise affect the displacement signal of
   the proof mass, dominating the adhesion contribution under study.
   However, the information on the force impulse and time duration - even
   if with a low signal to noise ratio - is available in the different
   response of the vibration modes to the same input. An innovative
   technique is developed to estimate the adhesion impulse and time
   duration from the amplitudes of oscillation of the vibration modes of
   the proof mass in a relevant point of the modal shapes. Since no
   modification nor installation of additional sensors on the sensing body
   are required, the method can be applied also to systems with limited
   access and/ or possibility of interaction. The vibration modes of the
   proof mass are calculated by means of FEA allowing for an accurate modal
   decomposition of the measured signal, focusing on the bottom end of the
   relevant bandwidth. The amplitudes of oscillation of each mode, even if
   affected by systematic effects and strong disturbances, are estimated by
   means of optimal filtering of the dynamic response. By means of the
   vibration mode-based mathematical model the adhesion impulse and its
   time duration are calculated from the estimated oscillation amplitudes.

Abstract = {This paper details the development of an acoustically adaptive modular
   system capable of enhancing Speech Clarity (C-50 Clarity Index) in
   specific locations within a space in near real-time. The mechanical
   component of the system consists of quadrilateral, truncated pyramidal
   modules that extend or retract perpendicularly to their base. This
   enables said modules (1) to change in the steepness of the sides of
   their frustum, which changes the way incoming sound waves are
   deflected/reflected/diffused by the surfaces of the pyramid; and (2) to
   reveal or to hide the absorbent material under each module, which
   enables a portion of incoming sound waves to be absorbed/dissipated in a
   controlled manner. The present setup considers a fragmentary
   implementation of six modules. The behavior of these modules is
   determined by two steps in the computational component of the system.
   First, the initial position of the modules is set via a model previously
   generated by an evolutionary solver, which identifies the optimal
   extension/retraction extent of each of the six modules to select for
   individual configurations that collectively ascertain the highest
   clarity in said specific locations. Second, a simulated receiver at the
   location in question measures the actual clarity attained and updates
   the model's database with respect to the configuration's corresponding
   clarity-value. Since the nature of acoustics is not exact, if the
   attained measurement is lower than the model's prediction for said
   location under the best module-configuration, but higher than the
   second-best configuration for the same location, the modules remain at
   the initial configuration. However, if the attained values are lower,
   this step reconfigures the modules to instantiate the second-or third-,
   fourth-, etc.-best configuration and updates the model's database with
   respect to the new optimal module-configuration value. These steps
   repeat each time the user moves to another specific location. The
   objective of the system is to contribute to the intelligent and
   intuitive Speech Clarity regulation of an inhabited space. This
   contributes to its Interior Environmental Quality, which promotes
   well-being and quality of life.},

Abstract = {We introduce a novel approach to revision and updating where two
   semantics are used for the same class of theories. One semantics, the
   intended semantics, is used to give a theory its intended meaning, while
   the other, the back-up semantics, is used as a fall back whenever the
   intended semantics fails to provide a meaning to the theory.
   Almost nothing will be assumed about the exact properties of both the
   intended and the back-up semantics, except for the following relations
   between them: (i) the entailment relation based on the intended
   semantics is stronger than the entailment relation based on the back-up
   semantics and (ii) the back-up semantics is defined for a broader class
   of theories than the intended semantics.
   If, for some theory T, the intended semantics is not defined, revision
   of the theory is asked for. Like in the framework of classical theory
   revision, we apply revision by transforming the current theory T to
   another theory T' such that the intended semantics is defined for T'. In
   that case, the back-up semantics is used to guarantee that; as far as
   this latter semantics concerns, there is no loss in inferential power in
   transforming T to T'. Using this framework we develop some fairly
   intuitive postulates for (nonmonotonic) belief revision and updating.
   Together with some well-known abstract properties of entailment
   relations we then investigate which theory transformations are suitable
   for doing revision and updating of (nonmonotonic) theories. The main
   conclusions of this paper are:
   1. In general, for revision, retraction is not suitable and, in many
   cases, minimal revision can only be achieved by applying revision by
   expansion.
   2. When dealing with updating, retraction is not suitable for most
   nonmonotonic semantics. Even for nontrivial deletions, retracting
   information will not suffice if the back-up semantics satisfies some
   additional abstract properties.
   We conclude by showing that this framework offers a possibility for
   refining some existing approaches to revision of nonmonotonic theories.},

Title = {Hole-driven dynamics of a three-dimensional gravitational liquid curtain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {968},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {It is known that the disintegration of vertical liquid curtains (sheets)
   is affected crucially by the amplification of free edge holes forming
   inside the curtain. This paper aims to investigate the influence of the
   hole expansion dynamics, driven by the so-called rim retraction, on the
   breakup of a liquid curtain, in both supercritical (Weber number We > 1)
   and subcritical (We < 1) conditions. The analysis is based on
   three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. For a selected
   supercritical configuration, the steady flow topology is first analysed.
   The investigation reveals the classic triangular shape regime of the
   steady curtain, due to the surface-tension-induced borders retraction
   towards its centre plane. The unsteady dynamics is then investigated as
   the curtain response to a hole perturbation introduced artificially in
   the steady flow configuration. The hole evolution determines a rim
   retraction phenomenon inside the curtain, which is influenced by both
   capillary and gravity forces. In supercritical conditions, the hole does
   not influence the curtain flow dynamics in the long-time limit. By
   reducing the Weber number slightly under the critical threshold (We =
   1), the initial amplification rate of the hole area increases, due to
   the stronger retraction effect of surface tension acting on the hole
   rims. The free hole expansion in fully subcritical conditions (We < 1)
   is investigated finally by simulating an edge-free curtain flow. As We
   decreases progressively, the hole expands while it is convected
   downstream by gravity acceleration. In the range 0.4 < We < 1, the
   subcritical curtain returns to the intact unperturbed configuration
   after the hole expulsion at the downstream outflow. For We < 0.4, the
   surface tension force becomes strong enough to reverse the gravitational
   motion of the hole top point, which retracts upstream towards the sheet
   inlet section while expanding along the lateral directions. This last
   phenomenon causes finally the breakup of the curtain, which results in a
   columnar regime strictly resembling similar experimental findings of the
   literature.},

Title = {Investigation of LOM process quality using design of experiments
   approach},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {316-323},
Abstract = {Purpose - To investigate laminated object manufacturing (LOM) process
   quality, using a design of experiments approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - The quality characteristics measured were
   in-plane dimensional accuracy, actual layer thickness (ALT), and mean
   time per layer. The process parameters tested were nominal layer
   thickness (LT), heater temperature (HT), platform retract (PR), heater
   speed (HS), laser speed (LS), feeder speed (FS) and platform speed (PS).
   Atypical test part has been used, and matrix experiments were carried
   out based on Taguchi design. Optimal process parameter values were
   identified and finally, additive and regression models were applied to
   the experimental results and tested using evaluation experiments.
   Findings - The statistical analysis of the experimental results shows
   that error in X direction was higher than error in Y direction.
   Dimensional accuracy in X direction depends mainly on the HS (89
   percent) and HT (5 percent), and in Y direction on HS (50 percent), LT
   (31 percent), LS (9 percent), PS (6 percent), and HT Q percent). On the
   other hand, ALT depends mainly on the nominal ALT (96 percent), HS (2
   percent), HT (1 percent), and PR (11 percent). Finally, mean time per
   layer depends mainly on HS (59 percent), LS (17 percent), FS (17
   percent), and PS (4 percent). Research limitations/implications - Future
   work should involve extensive matrix experiments using parameters such
   as dimensions of test part (X-max, Y-max, Z(max)), hatch spacing in X
   and Y directions, and delay time between sequential layers. Practical
   implications - Using the extracted models, the quality of LOM parts can
   be predicted and appropriate process parameter values selected. This
   means minimization of post processing time, easier disengagement between
   supporting frame and part easier decubing, process optimization, less
   finishing and satisfactory final LOM parts or tools. Also, ALT
   prediction and mean time per layer analysis could be used to improve LOM
   build time predictions. Originality/value - The above analysis is useful
   for LOM users when predictions of part quality, paper consumption, and
   build time are needed. This methodology could be easily applied to
   different materials and initial conditions for optimisation},

Abstract = {Given an injective space D (a continuous lattice endowed with the Scott
   topology) and a subspace embedding j :X --> Y, Dana Scott asked whether
   the higher-order function {[}X --> D] --> {[}Y --> D] which takes a
   continuous map f : X --> D to its greatest continuous extension (f) over
   bar:Y --> D along j is Scott continuous. In this case the extension map
   is a subspace embedding. We show that the extension map is Scott
   continuous iff D is the trivial one-point space or j is a proper map in
   the sense of Hofmann and Lawson.
   In order to avoid the ambiguous expression ``proper subspace
   embedding{''}, we refer to proper maps as finitary maps. We show that
   the finitary sober subspaces of the injective spaces are exactly the
   stably locally compact spaces. Moreover, the injective spaces over
   finitary embeddings are the algebras of the upper power space monad on
   the category of sober spaces. These coincide with the retracts of upper
   power spaces of sober spaces. In the full subcategory of locally compact
   sober spaces, these are known to be the continuous meet-semilattices. In
   the full subcategory of stably locally compact spaces these are again
   the continuous lattices.
   The above characterization of the injective spaces over finitary
   embeddings is an instance of a general result an injective objects in
   poset-enriched categories with the structure of a KZ-monad established
   in this paper, which we also apply to various full subcategories closed
   under the upper power space construction and to the upper and lower
   power locale monads.
   The above results also hold for the injective spaces over dense subspace
   embeddings (continuous Scott domains). Moreover, we show that every
   sober space has a smallest finitary dense sober subspace (its support).
   The support always contains the subspace of maximal points, and in the
   stably locally compact case (which includes densely injective spaces) it
   is the subspace of maximal points iff that subspace is compact. (C) 1998

Abstract = {This paper presents the design, fabrication process, and experimental
   evaluation of a high-sensitivity, all-silica, all-fiber, micro machined
   Fabry-Perot strain-sensor. This sensor has a short Fabry-Perot cavity
   and thus allows for the application of low-resolution spectral
   interrogation systems; in our case the commercial white light signal
   interrogator was used. The fabrication process includes the design and
   production of special sensor-forming optical-fiber. This fiber includes
   a central titanium-doped region, a phosphorus doped-ring surrounding a
   titanium doped region, and pure silica cladding in order to produce the
   proposed sensor, two sections of sensor forming fiber are cleaved and
   etched in a HF/IPA solution. The phosphorus-doped region etches at a
   considerably higher rate than the other fiber-sections, and thus creates
   a deep gutter on the cleaved fibers frontal surface. The titanium-doped
   region etches at a rate that is, to some extent, higher than the
   etching-rate of pure silica, and thus creates a slightly retracted
   surface relative to the pure silica fiber-cladding. The etched fibers
   are then re-spliced to create an all-silica strain sensor in ``double
   configuration{''}, which has a section of etched sensor-forming fiber on
   both sides. Thus this sensor has a long active length, whilst the length
   of the Fabry-Perot cavity can be adjusted by a titanium-doping level.
   The central titanium-doped region also creates a waveguide structure
   that is used to deliver light to the cavity through one of the fibers.
   The proposed fabrication process is cost-effective and suitable for
   high-volume production. The greatest achievement of the depicted in-line
   strain sensor is the extension of its active sensor length, which is
   more than 50 times greater than the sensor-cavity's length, and is thus
   approximately 50 times more sensitive to strain. This sensor also
   exhibits low-intrinsic temperature sensitivity.},

Title = {A CNN Prediction Method for Belt Grinding Tool Wear in a Polishing
   Process Utilizing 3-Axes Force and Vibration Data},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper presents a tool wear monitoring methodology on the abrasive
   belt grinding process using vibration and force signatures on a
   convolutional neural network (CNN). A belt tool typically has a random
   orientation of abrasive grains and grit size variation for coarse or
   fine material removal. Degradation of the belt condition is a critical
   phenomenon that affects the workpiece quality during grinding. This work
   focuses on the identifation and the study of force and vibrational
   signals taken from sensors along an axis or combination of axes that
   carry important information of the contact conditions, i.e., belt wear.
   Three axes of the two sensors are aligned and labelled as X-axis
   (parallel to the direction of the tool during the abrasive process),
   Y-axis (perpendicular to the direction of the tool during the abrasive
   process) and Z-axis (parallel to the direction of the tool during the
   retract movement). The grinding process was performed using a customized
   abrasive belt grinder attached to a multi-axis robot on a mild-steel
   workpiece. The vibration and force signals along three axes (X, Y and Z)
   were acquired for four discrete sequential belt wear conditions:
   brand-new, 5-min cycle time, 15-min cycle time, and worn-out. The raw
   signals that correspond to the sensor measurement along the different
   axes were used to supervisedly train a 10-Layer CNN architecture to
   distinguish the belt wear states. Different possible combinations within
   the three axes of the sensors (X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, YZ and XYZ) were fed as
   inputs to the CNN model to sort the axis (or combination of axes) in the
   order of distinct representation of the belt wear state. The CNN
   classification results revealed that the combination of the XZ-axes and
   YZ-axes of the accelerometer sensor provides more accurate predictions
   than other combinations, indicating that the information from the Z-axis
   of the accelerometer is significant compared to the other two axes. In
   addition, the CNN accuracy of the XY-axes combination of dynamometer
   outperformed that of other combinations.},

Abstract = {What is the relation of humanity to the `rest of nature'? Situated in
   the epoch of the Anthropocene and as concerns about climate emergency
   dramatically rise, the paper looks beyond the human/nature ontological
   separation and narratives of domination, in order to investigate the
   possibility of alternative worldviews and practices, instrumental for
   socio-ecological repair. Kentos, deriving from the greek verb kentaw
   (embroider or sting), describes the harvest practice of mastiha tree,
   which grows solely on Chios island. In the precision of the manual
   labour and the rituality of Kentos, one can read beyond pure production,
   a relationship of mutuality and a socio-ecological bond unfolding
   between human bodies, trees and their environment. The paper revisits
   the mastiha landscapes of Chios island, at North Aegean in Greece and
   narrates the story of relations that have occurred between humans and a
   tree native to the island, the Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia. It unpacks
   this socio-ecological bond and its various social, political and
   economic extensions, investigating how this interspecies relation has
   operated in history as a productive force and how it has survived in the
   present time, entangled in capitalist flows, climatic and urban
   pressures. The aim is to explore knowl-edge latent in interspecies
   relations that occurre in territories entangled in capitalist pro-cesses
   of extended urbanisation. Gathering this knowledge aims at informing
   alternative concepts and strategies for dealing with the contemporary
   socio-ecological challenges. The paper employs a methodology of
   relational thinking: it problematises and retracts strict onto-logical
   boundaries between human and `the rest of Nature'. By doing so it
   reveals a whole new space of relations between species and sets for an
   exploration of the relations that we encounter there. This space is
   examined and conceptualised through qualitative ethnographic work,
   analysis of documentary sources, oral history and secondary sources that
   have captured intentionally or unintentionally facets of the
   socio-ecological bond. Concluding, the paper identifies a socio-ecology
   of care nested in interspecies relations. It reveales care as a latent
   interspecies practice, as situated knowledge, as a more-than-human
   collective, and as an intrinsic value of reciprocity between forms of
   life, within and beyond capitalism, generating alternative
   socio-political formations and alternative vision. The paper ends with a
   proposi-tion: care is a choice, a valid alternative option for design
   space, strategy and practice to re-engage productively with the `rest of
   nature', material and living world. 2022 Higher Education Press Limited

Title = {Dynamic simulation of sphere motion in a vertical tube},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {518},
Pages = {61-93},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {In this paper, the sedimentation of a sphere and its radial migration in
   a Poiseuille flow in a vertical tube filled with a Newtonian fluid are
   simulated with a finite-difference-based distributed Lagrange multiplier
   (DLM) method. The flow features, the settling velocities, the
   trajectories and the angular velocities of the spheres sedimenting in a
   tube at different Reynolds numbers are presented. The results show that
   at relatively low Reynolds numbers, the sphere approaches the tube axis
   monotonically, whereas in a high-Reynolds-number regime where shedding
   of vortices takes place, the sphere takes up a spiral trajectory that is
   closer to the tube wall than the tube axis. The rotation motion and the
   lateral motion of the sphere are highly correlated through the Magnus
   effect, which is verified to be an important (but not the only) driving
   force for the lateral migration of the sphere at relatively high
   Reynolds numbers. The standard vortex structures in the wake of a
   sphere, for Reynolds number higher than 400, are composed of a loop
   mainly located in a plane perpendicular to the streamwise direction and
   two streamwise vortex pairs. When moving downstream, the legs of the
   hairpin vortex retract and at the same time a streamwise vortex pair
   with rotation opposite to that of the legs forms between the loops. For
   Reynolds number around 400, the wake structures shed during the impact
   of the sphere on the wall typically form into streamwise vortex
   structures or else into hairpin vortices when the sphere spirals down.
   The radial, angular and axial velocities of both neutrally buoyant and
   non-neutrally buoyant spheres in a circular Poiseuille flow are
   reported. The results are in remarkably good agreement with the
   available experimental data. It is shown that suppresion of the sphere
   rotation produces significant large additional lift forces pointing
   towards the tube axis on the spheres in the neutrally buoyant and
   more-dense-downflow cases, whereas it has a negligible effect on the
   migration of the more dense sphere in upflow.},

Title = {A non-retraction path planning approach for extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {132-144},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Notwithstanding the widespread use and large number of advantages over
   traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, the application of
   additive manufacturing technologies is currently limited by the
   undesirable fabricating efficiency, which has attracted attentions from
   a wide range of areas, such as fabrication method, material improvement,
   and algorithm optimization. As a critical step in the process planning
   of additive manufacturing, path planning plays a significant role in
   affecting the build time by means of determining the paths for the
   printing head's movement. So a novel path filling pattern for the
   deposition of extrusion-based additive manufacturing is developed in
   this paper, mainly to avoid the retraction during the deposition
   process, and hence the time moving along these retracting paths can be
   saved and the discontinuous deposition can be avoided as well. On the
   basis of analysis and discussion of the reason behind the occurrence of
   retraction in the deposition process, a path planning strategy called
   ``go and back{''} is presented to avoid the retraction issue. The ``go
   and back{''} strategy can be adopted to generate a continuous extruder
   path for simple areas with the start point being connected to the end
   point. So a sliced layer can be decomposed into several simple areas and
   the sub-paths for each area are generated based on the proposed
   strategy. All of these obtainable sub-paths can be connected into a
   continuous path with proper selection of the start point. By doing this,
   separated sub-paths are joined with each other to decrease the number of
   the startup and shutdown process for the extruder, which is beneficial
   for the enhancement of the deposition quality and the efficiency.
   Additionally, some methodologies are proposed to further optimize the
   generated non-retraction paths. At last, several cases are used to test
   and verify the developed methodology and the comparisons with
   conventional path filling patterns are conducted. The results show that
   the proposed approach can effectively reduce the retraction motions and
   is especially beneficial for the high efficient additive manufacturing
   without compromise on the part resistance.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a study of a novel vane pump power split
   transmission (VPPST). The transmission incorporates a new component, the
   Vane Power Split Unit (VPSU). The VPSU is a double-acting vane pump with
   a floating ring where the input shaft is connected to the engine and the
   floating ring is connected to the output shaft. The VPSU generates
   hydraulic oil flow at a rate proportional to the difference in angular
   velocities between the input and output shafts. This flow enters a
   hydraulic motor mounted to the output shaft. The vane pump power split
   transmission (VPPST) is a combination of the double-acting vane pump
   (VPSU) and the hydraulic motor directly connected to the pump. A CFD
   model of the VPSU has been created to better understand its performance.
   The model uses the threedimensional CFD commercial code PumpLinx,
   developed by Simerics Inc.
   Thanks to collaboration with the code developers, the model is able to
   predict the complex fluid dynamics in the pockets in the rotor into
   which the vanes retract. These pockets are referred to as under-vane
   volumes. The rotor of the vane pump, in fact, has several internal
   channels that connect the pumping chambers between the vanes to the
   under-vane volumes. The combination of the vanes and the internal ducts
   and volumes of the under-vanes have been modelled as dynamic
   ``valves{''} that rotate with the rotor. In this way the radial
   movements of the vanes are computed as a part of the simulation, based
   on the pressures due to the compression of the volumes on the inner
   diameter side of the vanes. The study is a result of collaboration
   between the University of Minnesota and the University of Naples
   ``Federico II{''} research groups and the code developers of Simerics
   Inc. The universities and Simerics Inc. have all been involved in this
   project, working in close cooperation for the model building and
   simulations.},

Abstract = {Background and aim Clinically relevant pancreatic leaks of
   jejunal-pancreatic anastomosis after pancreato-duodenectomy (PD) occur
   in 9-15\% of cases. Endoscopic strategies for management of pancreatic
   fistula, may allow to avoid reoperation and shorten times for fistula
   closure, but are still understudied and not widely performed. Aim of the
   present paper is to describe different endoscopic techniques used to
   treat such conditions. Methods It was a retrospective, single centre,
   study. All patients who underwent endoscopic treatment for pancreatic
   leaks following PD between 1st January 2013 and 31th May 2019 at our
   Centre were reviewed. Depending on the morphology and severity of the
   leak, four main endoscopic techniques were performed: (1)
   trans-anastomotic intraductal pancreatic stent insertion; (2)
   lumen-apposing metal stent between the jejunal loop and the
   retroperitoneum toward the pancreatic stump insertion
   ({''}yoyo-stent{''}); (3) large calibre nose-to-retroperitoneum drain
   insertion; (4) when a wide damage of the jejunal wall or a coexistent
   biliary-jejunal leak were observed, triple metal stent insertion was
   performed as follow in order to close the defect: enteral fully-covered
   SEMS in the jejunal stump, a pancreatic metal stent into the Wirsung
   duct and a fully-covered SEMS across the bilio-digestive anastomosis,
   through the meshes of the enteral stent. In all cases, surgical drain
   was simultaneously retracted. Results We identified 13 patients who
   underwent endoscopic treatment for POPF after PD. In total, 5 patients
   underwent ``Yoyo stent insertion{''}, 3 with nose-to-collection drain
   placement and four patients were treated with triple-stent insertion; in
   only one patient intrapancreatic SEMS insertion was performed. Technical
   success was 100\% and clinical success was 83.3\%. Mean time for leak
   closure was 4.8 days (range 2-10). During the follow-up interval, no
   leak recurrences were observed. Conclusions Our experience confirms
   efficacy and safety of endoscopic management of POPF following
   pancreatoduodenectomy management. Endoscopy should play a central role
   in this clinical scenario.},

Title = {The effect of stacking sequence and circumferential ply drop locations
   on the mechanical response of type IV composite pressure vessels
   subjected to internal pressure: A numerical and experimental study},
Journal = {COMPOSITE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {294},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Type IV composite pressure vessels represent the current
   state-of-the-art for compressed gaseous hydrogen storage in fuel cell
   electric vehicles. A combination of highly demanding safety regulations
   and the need for cost competitive solutions make the topic of CPVs
   particularly challenging. Given the elevated material price of carbon
   fiber, structural optimality is essential to meet both requirements.
   Thorough understanding of design parameters and mechanical performance
   of composite pressure vessels is prerequisite to structural optimality.
   In this paper we investigate the relation of stacking sequence and
   circumferential ply drop locations on the mechanical performance of type
   IV composite pressure vessels subjected with internal pressure. This
   paper builds on previous studies by the authors, which are enhanced by
   new numerical and experimental results. An experimental set is used,
   where for a given layup composition the stacking sequence and the
   circumferential ply drop locations are varied. The experimental results
   are complemented by a computationally efficient numerical framework,
   which is composed by the output of a commercial filament winding
   software, a self-developed geometry correction algorithm and an
   automated FE model generation program. The numerical results are
   compared with outer surface strains obtained by means of
   three-dimensional digital image correlation, the final burst pressures
   and the vessel remainders. The achieved burst pressures vary between
   152.6 and 188.6 MPa, depending on design configuration. For the layup
   composition in this investigation, the placement of tangentially
   reinforcing layers (e.g. circumferential and high-angle helical layers)
   as innermost layers led to overall higher cylinder strengths compared to
   sequences, where these layers were located as outermost. The retraction
   of circumferential ply drop locations was found to impact the burst
   performance differently in dependence of the stacking sequence. For
   sequences, where circumferential layers were located as outermost, a
   retraction of ply drop locations by 12 mm showed barely any differences
   in burst pressure (-1.9\%). For sequences, where these layers were
   located as innermost, a severe decrease (-19.1\%) was noticed once the
   ply drop locations were retracted by up to 9 mm. The results not only
   underlined the criticality of both design parameters and their
   interaction with each other, but also showcased a computationally
   efficient numerical framework capable of capturing distinct mechanical
   responses for a variety of layups at least trend-wise.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Developing novel diagnostic and screening tools for
   exploring intracranial injuries following mi-nor head trauma is a
   necessity. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum
   glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in detecting intracranial
   injuries following minor head trauma.Methods: An extensive search was
   performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to
   the end of April 2022. Hu-man observational studies were chosen,
   regardless of sex and ethnicity of their participants. Pediatrics
   studies, report of diagnostic value of GFAP combined with other
   biomarkers (without reporting the GFAP alone), arti-cles including
   patients with all trauma severity, defining minor head trauma without
   intracranial lesions as the outcome of the study, not reporting
   sensitivity/specificity or any other values essential for computation of
   true positive, true negative, false positive and false-negative, being
   performed in the prehospital setting, assessing the prognostic value of
   GFAP, duplicated reports, preclinical studies, retracted articles, and
   review papers were excluded. The result was provided as pooled
   sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic score and diagnostic odds ratio,
   and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC)
   curve with a 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI).Results: Eventually, 11
   related articles were introduced into the meta-analysis. The pooled
   analysis implies that the area under the SROC curve for serum GFAP level
   in minor traumatic brain injuries (TBI) was 0.75 (95\% CI: 0.71 to
   0.78). Sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker in below 100 pg/ml
   cut-off were 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.78 to 0.89) and 0.39 (95\% CI: 0.24 to
   0.53), respectively. The diagnostic score and diagnostic odds ratio of
   GFAP in detection of minor TBI were 1.13 (95\% CI: 0.53 to 1.74) and
   3.11 (95\% CI: 1.69 to 5.72), respectively. The level of evidence for
   the presented results were moderate.Conclusion: The present study's
   findings demonstrate that serum GFAP can detect intracranial lesions in
   mild TBI patients. The optimum cut-off of GFAP in detection of TBI was
   below 100 pg/ml. As a result, implementing serum GFAP may be beneficial
   in mild TBI diagnosis for preventing unnecessary computed tomography
   (CT) scans and their related side effects.},

Abstract = {The common condition of atrial fibrillation is often treated by cutting
   diseased cardiac tissue to disrupt abnormal electrical conduction
   pathways. Heating abnormal tissue with electromagnetic power provides a
   minimally invasive surgical alternative to treat these cardiac
   arrhythmias. Radio frequency ablation has become the method of choice of
   many physicians. Recently, microwave power has also been shown to have
   great therapeutic benefit in medical treatment requiring precise heating
   of biological tissue. Since microwave power tends to be deposited
   throughout the volume of biological media, microwave heating offers
   advantages over other heating modalities that tend to heat primarily the
   contacting surface. It is also possible to heat a deeper volume of
   tissue with more precise control using microwaves than with purely
   thermal conduction or RF electrode heating. Microwave Cardiac Ablation
   (MCA) is used to treat heart tissue that allows abnormal electrical
   conduction by heating it to the point of inactivation. Microwave
   antennas that fit within catheter systems can be positioned close to
   diseased tissue. Specialized antenna designs that unfurl from the
   catheter within the heart can then radiate specifically shaped fields,
   which overcome problems such as excessive surface heating at the contact
   point. The state of the art in MCA is reviewed in this paper and a novel
   catheter-based unfurling wide aperture antenna is described. This
   antenna consists of the centre conductor of a coaxial line, shaped into
   a spiral and insulated from blood and tissue by a non-conductive fluid
   filled balloon. Initially stretched straight inside a catheter for
   transluminal guiding, once in place at the cardiac target, the coiled
   spiral antenna is advanced into the inflated balloon. Power is applied
   in the range of 50-150 W at the reserved industrial, scientific and
   medical (ISM) frequency of 915 MHz for 30-90 s to create an irreversible
   lesion. The antenna is then retracted back into the catheter for
   removal. Simulated and experimental measurements on phantoms, in vitro
   animal organ tissue and living animals have shown that these microwave
   applicators deliver the intended therapeutic lesions that are both wider
   and deeper than those generated by RF ablation or other recently
   reported microwave applicators.},

Title = {Self-Expanding Stent and Delivery System for Aortic Valve Replacement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Currently, aortic valve replacement procedures require a sternotomy and
   use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to arrest the heart and provide a
   bloodless field in which to operate. A less invasive alternative to open
   heart surgery is transapical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement
   (TAVR), already emerging as a feasible treatment for patients with high
   surgical risk. The bioprosthetic valves are delivered via catheters
   using transarterial or transapical approaches and are implanted within
   diseased aortic valves. This paper reports the development of a new
   self-expanding stent for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement and
   its delivery device for the transapical approach under real-time
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Made of nitinol, the new
   stent is designed to implant and embed a commercially available
   bioprosthetic aortic valve in aortic root. An MRI passive marker was
   affixed onto the stent and an MRI active marker to the delivery device.
   These capabilities were tested in ex vivo and in vivo experiments.
   Radial resistive force, chronic outward force, and the integrity of
   bioprosthesis on stent were measured through custom design dedicated
   test equipment. In vivo experimental evaluation was done using a porcine
   large animal model. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiment results indicate
   that the self-expanding stent provides adequate reinforcement of the
   bioprosthetic aortic valve and it is easier to implant the valve in the
   correct position. The orientation and positioning of the implanted valve
   is more precise and predictable with the help of the passive marker on
   stent and the active marker on delivery device. The new self-expanding
   nitinol stent was designed to exert a constant radial force and,
   therefore, a better fixation of the prosthesis in the aorta, which would
   result in better preservation of long-term heart function. The passive
   marker affixed on the stent and active marker embedded in the delivery
   devices helps to achieve precise orientation and positioning of the
   stent under MRI guidance. The design allows the stent to be retracted in
   the delivery device with a snaring catheter if necessary. Histopathology
   reports reveal that the stent is biocompatible and fully functional. All
   the stented bioprosthesis appeared to be properly seated in the aortic
   root. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007750]},

Title = {A mathematical model for the dynamics of large membrane deformations of

Year = {2004},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {In this paper we develop and extend a previous model of cell
   deformations, initially proposed to describe the dynamical behaviour of
   round-shaped cells such as keratinocytes or leukocytes, in order to take
   into account cell pseudopodial dynamics with large amplitude membrane
   deformations such as those observed in fibroblasts. Beyond the
   simulation (from a quantitative, parametrized model) of the
   experimentally observed oscillatory cell deformations, a final goal of
   this work is to underline that a set of common assumptions regarding
   intracellular actin dynamics and associated cell membrane local motion
   allows us to describe a wide variety of cell morphologies and protrusive
   activity.
   The model proposed describes cell membrane deformations as a consequence
   of the endogenous cortical actin dynamics where the driving force for
   large-amplitude cell protrusion is provided by the coupling between
   F-actin polymerization and contractility of the cortical actomyosin
   network. Cell membrane movements then result of two competing forces
   acting on the membrane, namely an intracellular hydrostatic protrusive
   force counterbalanced by a retraction force exerted by the actin
   filaments of the cell cortex. Protrusion and retraction forces are
   moreover modulated by an additional membrane curvature stress.
   As a first approximation, we start by considering a heterogeneous but
   stationary distribution of actin along the cell periphery in order to
   evaluate the possible morphologies that an individual cell might adopt.
   Then non-stationary actin distributions are considered. The simulated
   dynamic behaviour of this cytomechanical model not only reproduces the
   small amplitude rotating waves of deformations of round-shaped cells
   such as keratinocytes {[}as proposed in the original model of Alt and
   Tranquillo (1995, J. Biol. Syst. 3, 905-916)] but is furthermore in very
   good agreement with the protrusive activity of cells such as
   fibroblasts, where large amplitude contracting/retracting pseudopods are
   more or less periodically extended in opposite directions. In addition,
   the biophysical and biochemical processes taken into account by the
   cytomechanical model are characterized by well-defined parameters which
   (for the majority) can be discussed with regard to experimental data
   obtained in various experimental situations. (C) 2003 Society for

Abstract = {Many medical robots are used in orthopedic surgery. Treatment via a
   small incision is known as minimally invasive surgery. The restricted
   applicability of current robots in minimally invasive surgery led us to
   explore the development of a robotic assisting tool. In orthopedic
   surgery, the operating space is full of muscle tissues, ligaments, and
   tendons. These stiff tissues must be scraped and retracted to create a
   clear operating space and must be treated precisely so as not to damage
   the nerves and blood vessels they contain. However, many conventional
   surgical robots cannot be controlled precisely enough to work with stiff
   tissues because they are driven by wire-transmission. In our research,
   the final target is development of a muscle-scraping robot for surgical
   applications. As part of our previous work, we designed and built a
   prototype robot and then evaluated it in regard to its capability to
   peel living tissues and its range of motion in regard to a human model.
   In this paper, we describe the precise control method we developed for
   the robot to work with stiff tissues. The extended lengths of wires or
   belts were estimated from their tensions, based on a spring model and
   the Maxwell model. The control method was integrated into the feedback
   controller of the prototype robot. The control gain can be set to the
   desired specification using the motion equation model and our control
   method. The control method was tested for accuracy on a phantom with
   properties similar to the stiff tissues of humans. The method was tested
   with and without feedback from the extended belt length. With feedback,
   the control accuracy of the bending angle was 34\% higher that without
   feedback. Stability and high frequency response were simulated by both
   measured and calculated parameters. In the future, high frequency
   response will be improved by phase-lead compensation. Furthermore, our
   method can be recomposed and used to control robotic multi -joints
   motion in which the robot contacts soft tissues of more complicated
   property in human body. Finally, in future our muscle-scraping robot
   will be evaluated while working on stiff living tissues.},

Title = {Search-and-capture model of cytoneme-mediated morphogen gradient
   formation},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},

Abstract = {Morphogen protein gradients play an essential role in the spatial
   regulation of patterning during embryonic development. The most commonly
   accepted mechanism of protein gradient formation involves the diffusion
   and degradation of morphogens from a localized source. Recently, an
   alternative mechanism has been proposed, which is based on cell-to-cell
   transport via thin actin-rich cellular extensions known as cytonemes.
   Very little is currently known about the precise nature of the contacts
   between cytonemes and their target cells. Important unresolved issues
   include how cytoneme tips find their targets, how they are stabilized at
   their contact sites, and how vesicles are transferred to a receiving
   cell and subsequently internalized. It has been hypothesized that
   cytonemes find their targets via a random search process based on
   alternating periods of retraction and growth, perhaps mediated by some
   chemoattractant. This is an actin-based analog of the search-and-capture
   model of microtubules of the mitotic spindle searching for cytochrome
   binding sites (kinetochores) prior to separation of cytochrome pairs. In
   this paper we develop a search-and-capture model of cytoneme-based
   morphogenesis, in which nucleating cytonemes from a source cell
   dynamically grow and shrink along the surface of a one-dimensional array
   of target cells until making contact with one of the target cells. We
   analyze the first-passagetime problem for making contact and then use
   this to explore the formation of morphogen gradients under the mechanism
   proposed for Wnt in vertebrates. That is, we assume that morphogen is
   localized at the tip of a growing cytoneme, which is delivered as a
   ``morphogen burst{''} to a target cell when the cytoneme makes temporary
   contact with a target cell before subsequently retracting. We show how
   multiple rounds of search-andcapture, morphogen delivery, cytoneme
   retraction, and nucleation events lead to the formation of a morphogen
   gradient. We proceed by formulating the morphogen bursting model as a
   queuing process, analogous to the study of translational bursting in
   gene networks. In order to analyze the expected times for cytoneme
   contact, we introduce an efficient method for solving first-passage-time
   problems in the presence of sticky boundaries, which exploits some
   classical concepts from probability theory, namely, stopping times and
   the strong Markov property. We end the paper by demonstrating how this
   method simplifies previous analyses of a well-studied problem in cell
   biology, namely, the search-and-capture model of microtubule-kinetochore
   attachment. Although the latter is completely unrelated to
   cytoneme-based morphogenesis from a biological perspective, it shares
   many of the same mathematical elements.},

Title = {Bubble coalescence in low-viscosity power-law fluids},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {902},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {As two spherical gas bubbles of radii (R) over tilde are brought
   together inside a liquid of density (rho) over tilde, viscosity (mu)
   over tilde and surface tension (sigma) over tilde, the liquid sheet
   separating them drains, thins and ultimately ruptures. The instant and
   location at which the bubbles make contact, and whereby a circular hole
   of vanishingly small radius is formed in the thin sheet, represent the
   occurrence of a finite-time singularity. The large curvature near the
   edge of the sheet where the hole has just formed, and where the two
   bubbles are now connected via a microscopic gas bridge, drives liquid to
   flow radially outward, causing the sheet to retract and the radius of
   the hole (R) over tilde (min) to increase with time. Recent work in this
   area has uncovered self-similarity and universal scaling regimes when
   two bubbles coalesce in a Newtonian fluid. Motivated by applications in
   which the exterior is a deformation-rate-thinning, power-law fluid,
   recent studies on bubble coalescence in Newtonian fluids are extended to
   coalescence in power-law fluids. In such fluids, viscosity decreases
   with deformation rate (gamma) over tilde raised to the n - 1 power where
   0 < n <= 1 (n = 1 for a Newtonian fluid). Attention is focused here on
   power-law fluids that are slightly viscous at zero deformation rate,
   i.e. when the Ohnesorge number Oh = <(mu)over tilde>(0)/((rho) over
   tilde(R) over tilde(sigma) over tilde)(1/2) is small (Oh << 1) and where
   (mu) over tilde (0) is the zero-deformation-rate viscosity. A
   combination of thin-film theory and three-dimensional, axisymmetric
   computations is used to probe the dynamics in the aftermath of the
   singularity. Heretofore unexplored regimes are uncovered, and criteria
   are developed for transitions between different regimes. The existence
   of a truly inviscid regime, predicted long ago by Keller (Phys. Fluids,
   vol. 26, 1983, pp. 3451-3453) and which comes into play as a purely
   geometrical limit of the free-surface shape, is also reported. New
   insights are presented on the much studied Newtonian limit beyond the
   initial regime reported by Munro et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 773, 2015,
   R3). The paper concludes with a phase diagram in (n, (R) over tilde
   (min)/(R) over tilde)-space, where the index n characterizes the fluid
   and (R) over tilde (min)/(R) over tilde the extent of coalescence, that
   highlights the various regimes and transitions between them.},

Title = {Dual submanifolds in rational homology spheres},
Journal = {SCIENCE CHINA-MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Let Sigma be a simply connected rational homology sphere. A pair of
   disjoint closed submanifolds M (+),M (-) aS, Sigma are called dual to
   each other if the complement Sigma - M (+) strongly homotopy retracts
   onto M (-) or vice-versa. In this paper, we are concerned with the basic
   problem of which integral triples (n;M (+),M (-)) a a{''}center dot(3)
   can appear, where n = dim Sigma - 1 and m (+/-) = codimm (+/-) - 1. The
   problem is motivated by several fundamental aspects in differential
   geometry.
   The theory of isoparametric/Dupin hypersurfaces in the unit sphere S
   (n+1) initiated by AeLie Cartan, where m (+/-) are the focal manifolds
   of the isoparametric/Dupin hypersurface M aS, S (n+1), and m (+/-)
   coincide with the multiplicities of principal curvatures of M.
   The Grove-Ziller construction of non-negatively curved Riemannian
   metrics on the Milnor exotic spheres Sigma, i.e., total spaces of smooth
   S-3-bundles over S-4 homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to S-7, where m
   (+/-) = P (+/- x SO(4)) S-3, P -> S-4 the principal SO(4)-bundle of
   Sigma and P (+/-) the singular orbits of a cohomogeneity one SO(4) x
   SO(3)-action on P which are both of codimension 2.
   Based on the important result of Grove-Halperin, we provide a
   surprisingly simple answer, namely, if and only if one of the following
   holds true: m (+) = m (-) = n
   m (+) = m (-) = 1/3n a \{1, 2, 4, 8\}
   m (+) = m (-) = 1/4n a \{1, 2\}
   m (+) = m (-) = 1/6n a \{1, 2\}
   = 1 or 2, and for the latter case, m (+) + m (-) is odd if min(m (+),m
   (-)) ae<yen> 2.
   In addition, if Sigma is a homotopy sphere and the ratio = 2 (for
   simplicity let us assume 2 6 m (-) ae m (+)), we observe that the work
   of Stolz on the multiplicities of isoparametric hypersurfaces applies
   almost identically to conclude that, the pair can be realized if and
   only if, either (m (+),m (-)) = (5, 4) or m (+) +m (-) +1 is divisible
   by the integer delta(m (-)) (see the table on page 3), which is
   equivalent to the existence of (m (-)-1) linearly independent vector
   fields on the sphere by Adams' celebrated work. In contrast, infinitely
   many counterexamples are given if Sigma is a rational homology sphere.},

Abstract = {A key part of an intelligent tutoring system is its student model.
   Difficulties in developing robust and sound student models have led to
   the use of ad hoc approaches: certainty factor approaches with unclear
   semantics and updating procedures that can double-count evidence; and,
   more generally, to disenchantment with the intelligent tutoring approach
   in favor of microworlds, and learning environments that do not require
   student models.
   The recent use of Bayesian student models places student models and
   intelligent tutoring systems back on firm ground, where the laws of
   probability provide a well-defined semantics and a sound means of
   propagating changes to the model. But Bayesian student models have not
   been widely embraced due to the difficulty in understanding the
   mathematics behind Bayesian belief networks, the difficulty in
   implementing the: algorithms, the high costs of commercial packages, and
   the sometimes lengthy delays in updating, as updating is in general
   NP-hard,
   The intention of this paper is to make a practical and useful form of
   Bayesian student modeling readily accessible to any ITS developer,
   regardless of their understanding of Bayesian belief networks, by
   providing an algorithm that can be easily implemented in less than a
   week in any object-oriented language. The algorithm only addresses
   student models represented as trees of any height and width, bur in
   return guarantees linear-time updating.
   In addition, we show how the algorithm can be used to handle different
   kinds of evidence:query evidence, cask evidence, and subjective
   assessments. The algorithm allows any number of these kinds of
   assessments. It allows ani. number of skill levels, and questions and
   tasks that are of similarly varying degrees of difficulty. Evidence can
   also be retracted, for trample, to simulate the discarding of data that
   is less relevant as rime passes.
   This algorithm, called BSMA, For Bayesian Student Modeling Algorithm. is
   derived from the tree propagation algorithms of Pearl and Neapolitan. It
   specializes Pearl's parallel algorithm to run on one processor and
   restricts new evidence to nodes that are added to the tree, Father than
   allowing arbitrary instantiation of tree nodes to values. It also
   extends the algorithm to allow this evidence, previously introduced as
   new nodes, to be dropped later. Additional simplifications in notation
   have been made to facilitate: an intuitive understanding of the
   algorithm's operation.},

Abstract = {Concern about future anthropogenic warming has lead to demands for
   information on what might happen to fish and fisheries under various
   climate-change scenarios. One suggestion has been to use past events as
   a proxy for what will happen in the future. In this paper a comparison
   between the responses of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to two major warm
   periods in the North Atlantic during the 20th century is carried out to
   determine how reliable the past might be as a predictor of the future.
   The first warm period began during the 1920s, remained relatively warm
   through the 1960s, and was limited primarily to the northern regions
   (>60 degrees N). The second warm period, which again covered the
   northern regions but also extended farther south (30 degrees N), began
   in the 1990s and has continued into the present century. During the
   earlier warm period, the most northern of the cod stocks (West
   Greenland, Icelandic, and Northeast Arctic cod in the Barents Sea)
   increased in abundance, individual growth was high, recruitment was
   strong, and their distribution spread northward. Available plankton data
   suggest that these cod responses were driven by bottom-up processes.
   Fishing pressure increased during this period of high cod abundance and
   the northern cod stocks began to decline, as early as the 1950s in the
   Barents Sea but during the 1960s elsewhere. Individual growth declined
   as temperatures cooled and the cod distributions retracted southward.
   During the warming in the 1990s, the spawning stock biomass of cod in
   the Barents Sea again increased, recruitment rose, and the stock spread
   northward, but the individual growth did not improve significantly. Cod
   off West Greenland also have shown signs of improving recruitment and
   increasing biomass, albeit they are still very low in comparison to the
   earlier warming period. The abundance of Icelandic cod, on the other
   hand, has remained low through the recent warm period and spawning stock
   biomass and total biomass are at levels near the lowest on record. The
   different responses of cod to the two warm events, in particular the
   reduced cod production during the recent warm period, are attributed to
   the effects of intense fishing pressure and possibly related ecosystem
   changes. The implications of the results of the comparisons on the
   development of cod scenarios under future climate change are addressed.

Title = {Notices and Policies for Retractions, Expressions of Concern, Errata and
   Corrigenda: Their Importance, Content, and Context},

Abstract = {A retraction notice is an essential scientific historical document
   because it should outline the reason(s) why a scientific manuscript was
   retracted, culpability (if any) and any other factors that have given
   reason for the authors, editors, or publisher, to remove a piece of the
   literature from science's history books. Unlike an expression of concern
   (EoC), erratum or corrigendum, a retraction will usually result in a
   rudimentary vestige of the work. Thus, any retraction notice that does
   not fully indicate a set of elements related to the reason and
   background for the retraction serves as a poor historical document.
   Moreover, poorly or incompletely worded retraction notices in fact do
   not serve their intended purpose, i.e., to hold all parties accountable,
   and to inform the scientific and wider public of the problem and reason
   for the paper's demise. This paper takes a look at the definitions and
   the policies of clauses for retractions, EoCs, errata and corrigenda in
   place by 15 leading science, technology and medicine (STM) publishers
   and four publishing-related bodies that we believe have the greatest
   influence on the current fields of science, technology and medicine. The
   primary purpose was to assess whether there is a consistency among these
   entities and publishers. Using an arbitrary 5-scale classification
   system, and evaluating the different categories of policies separately,
   we discovered that in almost all cases (88.9 \%), the wording used to
   define these four categories of polices differs from that of the
   Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), which is generally considered to
   be the guiding set of definitions in science publishing. In addition, as
   much as 61 \% deviation in policies (wording and meaning), relative to
   COPE guidelines, was discovered. When considering the average pooled
   deviation across all categories of policies, we discovered that there
   was either no deviation or a small deviation, only in the wording, in
   the definition of policies when compared to the COPE guidelines in 1 out
   of 3 ethical bodies, and in 40 \% (6 out of 15) STM publishers. Moderate
   deviation from the COPE guidelines was detected in 26.7 \% of STM
   publishers and one ethical body but a large deviation in one ethical
   body and 20 \% of STM publishers was observed. Two STM publishers (13.3
   \%) did not report any information about these policies. Even though in
   practice, editors and publishers may deviate from these written
   definitions when dealing with case-by-case issues, we believe that it is
   essential, to serve as a consistent guide for authors and editors, that
   the wording be standardized across these entities. COPE and these
   entities also have the responsibility of making it clear that these
   definitions are merely suggestions and that their application may be
   subjected to subjective interpretation and application.},

Title = {A fatal fall from a balcony? A biomechanical approach to resolving
   conflicting witness accounts},
Journal = {MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {233-244},

Abstract = {An adult male was found below a third floor balcony having sustained
   fatal head injuries. An account provided by a witness described how the
   deceased had been in high spirits and had engaged in swinging from the
   third floor balcony rail in an attempt to swing onto a lower second
   floor balcony and whilst doing so had lost his grip and fallen (10.67
   metres) to the ground below. A conflicting account was provided, some
   weeks later, by a second witness, who claimed to have observed an
   argument between two men on a third floor balcony, during which one had
   vigorously pushed the other over the balcony rail. The push, it was
   alleged, caused the man to move very quickly over the balcony rail and
   fall in an `upturned crucifix' position to the ground. This paper
   describes a series of biomechanical experiments, conducted on a
   reconstruction of the third floor balcony and the second floor balcony
   rail, during which a volunteer was subjected to the two fall scenarios,
   in an attempt to resolve the conflicting witness accounts. Analysis of
   human movement was performed using a 3-D motion analysis system, markers
   were placed at the volunteer's key joint centres and were tracked to
   determine physical parameters. The parameter values were used to
   calculate what dynamic movements may have occurred had the volunteer
   been allowed to fall, not just a distance equivalent to the lower
   balcony rail but a greater distance, equivalent to that between the
   balcony and the ground. Calculations indicate that during the
   hanging-fall scenario a range of body rotation was produced between 159
   degrees and 249 degrees, that is, an upturned head-first body
   orientation, consistent with that required to produce the described
   injuries and consistent with the description provided by the first
   witness. The pushfall scenario, however, produced a greater estimated
   body rotation of between 329 degrees and 530 degrees, equal to the body
   rotating, from the point of free-fall to the moment of impact, between
   almost 1 and 1.5 times. This was consistent with the described injuries
   but inconsistent with the description provided by the second witness. It
   was therefore concluded that although both the accidental and
   inflicted-push scenarios could produce a body orientation consistent
   with the reported injuries, only the accidental scenario produced a fall
   which could be described as an `upturned crucifix', since the push
   scenario produced a significantly greater body rotation. The witness who
   alleged that the deceased had been pushed later retracted his statement.},

Title = {Local Application of Drugs to Study Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor
   Function in Mouse Brain Slices},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tobacco use leads to numerous health problems, including cancer, heart
   disease, emphysema, and stroke. Addiction to cigarette smoking is a
   prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder that stems from the biophysical and
   cellular actions of nicotine on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
   (nAChRs) throughout the central nervous system. Understanding the
   various nAChR subtypes that exist in brain areas relevant to nicotine
   addiction is a major priority.
   Experiments that employ electrophysiology techniques such as whole-cell
   patch clamp or two-electrode voltage clamp recordings are useful for
   pharmacological characterization of nAChRs of interest. Cells expressing
   nAChRs, such as mammalian tissue culture cells or Xenopus laevis
   oocytes, are physically isolated and are therefore easily studied using
   the tools of modern pharmacology. Much progress has been made using
   these techniques, particularly when the target receptor was already
   known and ectopic expression was easily achieved. Often, however, it is
   necessary to study nAChRs in their native environment: in neurons within
   brain slices acutely harvested from laboratory mice or rats. For
   example, mice expressing ``hypersensitive{''} nAChR subunits such as
   alpha 4 L9'A mice (1) and alpha 6 L9' S mice (2), allow for unambiguous
   identification of neurons based on their functional expression of a
   specific nAChR subunit. Although whole-cell patch clamp recordings from
   neurons in brain slices is routinely done by the skilled
   electrophysiologist, it is challenging to locally apply drugs such as
   acetylcholine or nicotine to the recorded cell within a brain slice.
   Dilution of drugs into the superfusate (bath application) is not rapidly
   reversible, and U-tube systems are not easily adapted to work with brain
   slices.
   In this paper, we describe a method for rapidly applying
   nAChR-activating drugs to neurons recorded in adult mouse brain slices.
   Standard whole-cell recordings are made from neurons in slices, and a
   second micropipette filled with a drug of interest is maneuvered into
   position near the recorded cell. An injection of pressurized air or
   inert nitrogen into the drug-filled pipette causes a small amount of
   drug solution to be ejected from the pipette onto the recorded cell.
   Using this method, nAChR-mediated currents are able to be resolved with
   millisecond accuracy. Drug application times can easily be varied, and
   the drug-filled pipette can be retracted and replaced with a new
   pipette, allowing for concentration-response curves to be created for a
   single neuron. Although described in the context of nAChR neurobiology,
   this technique should be useful for studying many types of ligand-gated
   ion channels or receptors in neurons from brain slices.},

Title = {Complications of endonasal sinus surgery - Diagnostic and therapeutic
   consequences.},
Journal = {LARYNGO-RHINO-OTOLOGIE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Background: Functional endoscopic sinus surgery has been proven the
   therapeutic method of choice in surgical therapy of chronic sinusitis.
   On the other hand, endonasal sinus surgery may cause severe
   complications even when performed by a skilled surgeon. This is easily
   explained by the close vicinity of many functionally important
   structures to the operative site. Case reports: Three histories are
   reported that involve possible complications even in apparently simple
   cases. Diagnostic and therapeutic consequences are discussed. In a case
   previously diagnosed histologically as chronic unspecific sinusitis, an
   endonasal biopsy resulted in endocranial bleeding requiring
   neurosurgical intervention. Midline granuloma was found to be the
   correct diagnosis. Another patient was seen with a normal X-ray of the
   sinuses and solitary polypoid structure in his left nose. Polypectomy
   was planned and a CT scan was performed, which demonstrated a
   meningocele. Transfacial surgery was then performed to remove the
   meningocele. Another patient presented with a traumatic impression of
   the frontal sinus, and open reposition by transfacial surgery of the
   frontal and ethmoid sinus was planned. When CT scans revealed an
   uncovered optic nerve in the sphenoid sinus of the fractured side, we
   abandoned ethmodectomy and performed reposition of the frontal sinus as
   the only surgical procedure. Results and Conclusions: In this paper, we
   show typical complications of endonasal sinus surgery and strategies for
   avoiding them. If any complication occur. prompt treatment is required.
   Three groups of complications can be defined: perforation of frontobasal
   dura resulting in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, severe bleeding,
   and orbital or optic nerve injury. When the surgeon discovers an
   intraoperative complication, possible consequences must be considered
   immediately to minimize side effects for the patient. A CSF fistula
   should be closed in the same procedure, and transfacial surgery may be
   necessary. Hemorrhage resulting from an ethmoidal artery may require
   frontoorbital surgery and ligation of this vessel. If retrobulbar
   hemorrhage caused by retraction of an ethmoid artery occurs, immediate
   intervention is necessary. Usually a transfacial approach, resection of
   the medial orbital wall and retrobulbar decompression are performed. In
   some cases lateral canthotomy may be the best way to drain haematoma and
   decompress the optic nerve. Subsequently, orbital revision and ligation
   of the retracted artery must be performed. Any delay can result in
   persistant visual loss. We conclude that the extranasal frontoorbital
   approach should be part of the residency training program in ENT
   departments. Any surgeon performing endonasal sinus surgery must be
   trained in transfacial emergency procedures, which should be part of
   anatomic preparations in teaching courses, thus avoiding severe damage
   in case of intraoperative complication.},

Title = {A Step Change in Drill-Bit Technology With Self-Adjusting
   Polycrystalline-Diamond-Compact Bits},
Journal = {SPE DRILLING \& COMPLETION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {286-294},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since they were first introduced to the market decades ago,
   polycrystalline-diamond-compact(PDC) bits have undergone numerous
   technological improvements. One such example is depth-of-cut
   (DOC)-control technology. Introduced in the early 2000s, this technology
   emerged as an effective means to mitigate torsional vibrations by
   managing bit aggressiveness. Today, however, the drilling industry faces
   the task of drilling diverse sections of the well with a single bit.
   This is a significant challenge for fixed PDC bits, requiring a
   compromise that limits vibration mitigation in some sections of the well
   and/or top-end rate-of-penetration (ROP) performance in other sections.
   This paper presents an innovative PDC bit that can self-adjust its
   DOC-control characteristics to the constantly changing drilling
   environment and mitigate vibrations while delivering improved ROP. The
   self-adaptation is accomplished through a passive hydromechanical
   feedback mechanism encapsulated in self-contained cartridges that are
   installed inside the bit blades. The DOC-control elements mounted on the
   cartridges respond to the external loads through strategically designed
   rate-sensitive retraction and extension strokes. During unfavorable
   dynamic events, the elements engage with the formation and mitigate
   dysfunctions. During normal steady-state drilling, the elements
   gradually adjust their exposure to enable fast and efficient drilling.
   The operating principle of self-adjusting PDC bits is first demonstrated
   through laboratory drilling tests under confining pressure by use of
   full-scale prototype bits. The testing was expanded to a research well
   in the field to assess the ability to self-adapt and mitigate stick/slip
   vibrations. The field-test facility enables a controlled yet realistic
   environment with reduced uncertainty that is often not available in the
   field. The tests compare stick/slip tendencies of bits by building
   stability maps in weight-on-bit (WOB) and rev/min space by use of
   downhole measurements under similar operating conditions. Bits with the
   self-adjusting mechanism led to fewer instances of stick/slip than fixed
   PDC bits in multiple formation types. Self-adjusting bits significantly
   expanded the stable operating region and enabled operation at higher
   ROP.
   The ability of the DOC-control elements to continuously self-adjust
   their exposure overcomes several other limitations posed by the fixed
   nature of traditional DOC control. The technology does not require a
   fixed predesigned exposure; prevents overengagement because of its
   ability to retract; and eliminates iterative tuning of DOC control
   currently in practice. The technology is also anticipated to absorb
   impacts in interbedded formations and reduce damage from improper
   starting procedures. With many PDC-bit drilling applications being
   torque-limited, the technology opens up several possibilities to reduce
   drilling costs.},

Title = {Running over rough terrain: guinea fowl maintain dynamic stability
   despite a large unexpected change in substrate height},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {209},
Number = {1},
Pages = {171-187},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the natural world, animals must routinely negotiate varied and
   unpredictable terrain. Yet, we know little about the locomotor
   strategies used by animals to accomplish this while maintaining dynamic
   stability. In this paper, we perturb the running of guinea fowl with an
   unexpected drop in substrate height (AM. The drop is camouflaged to
   remove any visual cue about the upcoming change in terrain that would
   allow an anticipatory response. To maintain stability upon a sudden drop
   in substrate height and prevent a fall, the bird must compensate by
   dissipating energy or converting it to another form. The aim of this
   paper is to investigate the control strategies used by birds in this
   task. In particular, we assess the extent to which guinea fowl maintain
   body weight support and conservative spring-like body dynamics in the
   perturbed step. This will yield insight into how animals integrate
   mechanics and control to maintain dynamic stability in the face of
   real-world perturbations. Our results show that, despite altered body
   dynamics and a great deal of variability in the response, guinea fowl
   are quite successful in maintaining dynamic stability, as they stumbled
   only once (without failing) in the 19 unexpected perturbations. In
   contrast, when the birds could see the upcoming drop in terrain, they
   stumbled in 4 of 20 trials (20\%, falling twice), and came to a complete
   stop in an additional 6 cases (30\%). The bird's response to the
   unexpected perturbation fell into three general categories: (1)
   conversion of vertical energy (E-Y=E-p+E-Kv) to horizontal kinetic
   energy (E-Kh), (2) absorption of E-v through negative muscular work
   (-Delta E-com), or (3) converting E-p to vertical kinetic energy (EO,
   effectively continuing the ballistic path of the animal's center of mass
   (COM) from the prior aerial phase. However, the mechanics that
   distinguish these categories actually occur along a continuum with
   varying degrees of body weight support and actuation by the limb,
   related to the magnitude and direction of the ground reaction force
   (GRF) impulse, respectively. In most cases, the muscles of the limb
   either produced or absorbed energy during the response, as indicated by
   net changes in COM energy (E-com). The limb likely begins stance in a
   more retracted, extended position due to the 26 ms delay in ground
   contact relative to that anticipated by the bird. This could explain the
   diminished decelerating force during the first half of stance and the
   exchange between E-p and E-K during stance as the body vaults over the
   limb. The varying degree of weight support and energy absorption in the
   perturbed step suggests that variation in the initial limb configuration
   leads to different intrinsic dynamics and reflex action. Future
   investigation into the limb and muscle mechanics underlying these
   responses could yield further insight into the control mechanisms that
   allow such robust dynamic stability of running in the face of large,
   unexpected perturbations.},

Title = {Simple presentation of network theory of rubber, with a discussion of
   other theories},

Year = {1996},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {It seems now to be generally agreed that soft rubberlike materials
   consist of long flexible molecules more or less completely linked into a
   coherent network by chemical bonds formed during cure. These bonds
   suppress, for the most I!art, the plasticity that the liquid-like mass
   of molecules would otherwise have, but leave the molecules free to take
   on a great many configurations of essentially the same energy under the
   influence of thermal agitation. The tendency of stretched rubber to
   retract is then understood as a kinetic phenomenon, like the tendency of
   a gas to expand; it is the tendency of a system to assume the form of
   maximum entropy when the internal energy is essentially independent to
   form.
   There is no similar agreement as to what constitutes an adequate
   theoretical treatment of such:materials. In particular, there exists a
   wide variety of formalisms for the derivation of the stress-strain
   relation of an ideal soft rubber. These are usually referred to as
   network theories, though the only treatment that actually deals with a
   general network of flexible molecular chains is that of the authors (1).
   Other treatments have been based on the consideration Of individual
   elements or small groups of elements from networks,concerning the
   behavior of which special assumptions were made, or they have proceeded
   on the basis of general ideas that involve no reference whatever to the
   network structure of the material. The relation of these theories to the
   general network theory of rubber is the subject of the present paper.
   As background for the discussion of other theories we shall first
   develop the theory of rubber, considered as a random network of long
   flexible molecules, in a particularly simple way. The ease with which a
   network of general form can be treated will make it evident that there
   is little need to base network theories of rubber on the use of more
   special models. Next, we shall examine an idea that appears in many
   discussions of rubber which employ simplified models the idea that the
   junctions of the rubber network can be treated as if they were fixed in
   space. We shall show that this picture of the situation is quite
   unrealistic: the junctions have a Brownian motion comparable to that of
   any portion of the intervening molecular segments. The common assumption
   to the contrary does not affect the results of some types of
   calculations, but it is inadmissible in the treatment of other problems.
   Finally, we shall show that the theory of Wall (2), which employs no
   special model, is based on postulates that are inconsistent with the
   network structure of rubber.},

Abstract = {Robotic systems are being introduced into surgery to extend human
   ability. NeuroArm represents a potential change in the way surgery is
   performed; this is the first image-guided, MR-compatible surgical robot
   capable of both microsurgery and stereotaxy. This paper presents the
   first surgical application of neuroArm in an investigation of
   microsurgical performance, navigation accuracy, and Phase I clinical
   studies.
   To evaluate microsurgical performance, 2 surgeons performed microsurgery
   (splenectomy, bilateral nephrectomy, and thymectomy) in a rodent model
   using neuroArm and conventional techniques. Two senior residents served
   as controls, using the conventional technique only (8 rats were used in
   each of the 3 treatment groups; the 2 surgeons each treated 4 rats from
   each group). Total surgery time, blood loss, thermal injury, vascular
   injury, and animal death due to surgical error were recorded and
   converted to an overall performance score. All values are reported as
   the mean +/- SEM when normally distributed and as the median and
   interquartile range when not. Surgeons were slower using neuroArm (1047
   +/- 69 seconds) than with conventional microsurgical techniques (814 +/-
   54 seconds; p = 0.019), but overall performance was equal (neuroArm:
   1110 +/- 82 seconds; microsurgery: 1075 +/- 136 seconds; p = 0.825).
   Using microsurgery, the surgeons had overall performance scores equal to
   those of the control resident surgeons (p = 0.141).
   To evaluate navigation accuracy, the localization error of neuroArm was
   compared with an established system. Nanoparticles were implanted at
   predetermined bilateral targets in a cadaveric model (4 specimens) using
   image guidance. The mean localization error of neuroArm (4.35 +/- 1.68
   mm) proved equal to that of the conventional navigation system (10.4 +/-
   2.79 mm; p = 0.104). Using the conventional system, the surgeon was
   forced to retract the biopsy tool to correct the angle of entry in 2 of
   4 trials.
   To evaluate Phase I clinical integration, the role of neuroArm was
   progressively increased in 5 neurosurgical procedures. The impacts of
   neuroArm on operating room (OR) staff, hardware, software, and
   registration system performance were evaluated. NeuroArm was well
   received by OR staff and progressively integrated into patient cases,
   starting with draping in Case 1. In Case 2 and all subsequent cases, the
   robot was registered. It was used for tumor resection in Cases 3-5.
   Three incidents involving restrictive cable length, constrictive
   draping, and reregistration failure were resolved. In Case 5, the
   neuroArm safety system successfully mitigated a hardware failure.
   NeuroArm performs as well and as accurately as conventional techniques,
   with demonstrated safety technology. Clinical integration was well
   received by OR staff, and successful tumor resection validates the
   surgical applicability of neuroArm. (DOI: 10.3171/2009.2.JNS081334)},

Title = {Impact of surgical approaches on the lumbar multifidus muscle: an
   experimental study using sheep as models Laboratory investigation},

Abstract = {Object. In this paper, the authors assessed the effects of different
   surgical approaches and reconstructive methods on the spinous process
   after lumbar surgery in sheep.
   Methods. A total of 41 healthy, adult sheep weighing 38-40 kg were used
   in this study. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (10
   animals per group and I control). Animals in Group A underwent a spinous
   process splitting procedure to expose the lamina. Animals in Group B had
   bilateral multifidus muscles stripped and the spinous process excised.
   All animals in Group C underwent unilateral stripping of the multifidus
   muscle from the spinous process (Group Cl) as well as spinous process
   splitting at the bottom to expose the contralateral lamina attached to
   the multifidus muscle (Group C2). To mimic the laminoplasty procedure,
   the multifidus muscles were stripped bilaterally in Group D. For all
   groups, the surgical level (L-6), length of incision (4 cm), the
   retracting distance, and time (40 minutes) remained constant. Ten months
   after surgery, the atrophy rate of the cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of
   the multifidus muscle. MR imaging findings, and histological changes of
   the muscle tissue were evaluated. Normal multifidus muscles taken from a
   healthy sheep at the L-6 level and the preoperative data of MR imaging
   in experimental animals provided control data (Group E).
   Results. The MR imaging and histological scores of multifidus muscles
   from sheep in Groups A, B, C1, C2, and D were significantly decreased,
   and the atrophy rates were significantly higher than those from sheep in
   Group E (p < 0.05). The postoperative MR imaging and histological scores
   obtained in Groups A and C2 were highest and the atrophy rates were
   lowest, while animals from Group B had the highest atrophy rate and
   lowest MR imaging and histological scores among all experimental groups
   (p < 0.05). The scores for animals in Groups A and C2, in which the
   muscles were not stripped from the spinous process, achieved lower
   atrophy rates and higher MR imaging and histological scores than those
   for sheep in Groups C1 and D, in which the muscles were stripped (p <
   0.05). The groups in which the spinous process was reconstructed after
   detachment of the muscles (Groups C1 and D) had lower atrophy rates and
   higher MR imaging and histological scores than Group B (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions. The multificius muscle can be effectively protected by
   reducing the extent of muscle detachment and reconstructing the
   posterior bone-ligament complex. A spinous process splitting procedure
   is a useful method to reduce postoperative muscle atrophy. (DOI:

Title = {Application of the general microstructural model to erosion phenomena -
   mechanisms for the chemical-hydrodynamic conversion of bentonite to a
   pumpable slurry in conjunction with retrieval},
Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {109-116},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {One of the requirements of a system for disposal of spent nuclear fuel
   is that it should be possible and feasible to retrieve the canisters
   even after they have been put in place and the surrounding bentonite has
   absorbed water and developed a swelling pressure. This `gripping' of the
   canister must be released before the canister can be retracted from the
   deposition hole.
   One way to achieve this is to convert the bentonite into a slurry by
   exposing it to a flow of water containing dissolved salts such as sodium
   or calcium chloride. The potential efficiency of such a process is
   remarkable in view of the well-known tardiness of the saturation of
   compacted bentonite with pure water. The present study of the mechanisms
   involved was prompted by the need to understand the prerequisites and
   limitations of such a conversion process.
   Thus, the literature on the molecular structure of montmorillonite (the
   major constituent of bentonite) was reviewed as well as the literature
   on the microstructure of montmorillonite-water systems. A review was
   also made of some chemical literature which led to identification of two
   rate-limiting factors for montmorillonite microstructure conversion:
   diffusion over large distances and association-dissociation of primary
   montmorillonite particles.
   The knowledge compiled was then used in analyses of the kinetics
   involved and the following conclusions were made: (1) Exposure of the
   compacted bentonite with fresh water causes it to swell and to produce
   free particles by exfoliation. They form gels which cause closure of the
   pores so that further uptake of water becomes limited by diffusion. (2)
   Exposure of the compacted bentonite with water containing dissolved salt
   causes the exfoliated material in the microstructure to shrink (or at
   least swell less than in the fresh water case). Thus more water can
   penetrate into the pores and cause differential expansion in the
   aggregate residues which, in turn, leads to further widening of the
   pores. (3) The gel formed in the above described process may be removed
   by the flow of the water thus exposing fresh bentonite surface to
   continued attack.
   The paper is based on the general microstructural model but goes beyond
   it by including also dilute systems.
   It is concluded that the chemical-hydrodynamical method for removing
   bentonite from around a deposited canister might be shown to be a robust
   and efficient one provided that differential expansion of the individual
   grains in the microstructure is accomplished, that flocculated
   conditions can be avoided and that the chemically modified material can
   be removed by flushing. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Correlation Between Altmetric Attention Scores and Citations for
   Articles Published in High-Impact Factor Ophthalmology Journals From
   2018 to 2019},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE The Altmetric attention score (AAS) provides new information
   to gauge the impact of a research article not found through typical
   metrics, such as impact factor or citation counts.
   OBJECTIVE To explore the association between AAS and common impact
   markers among high-impact ophthalmology journals from 2018 to 2019.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS All articles published in the American
   Journal of Ophthalmology (AJO), JAMA Ophthalmology (JAMAO), and
   Ophthalmology (OPH) from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, were
   collected for this cross-sectional study. Excluded articles were those
   missing Altmetric data at the time of data collection. The AAS and
   associated social media impact for each article were collected with the
   AAS calculator bookmarklet. Spearman rank correlation analyses and
   analysis of variance tests were conducted to assess differences in
   various metrics between AJO, JAMAO, and OPH. The study included articles
   published of all document types (article, conference paper, editorial,
   erratum, letter, note, retracted, review, and short survey) and access
   status (open access and not open access).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The correlation between citation counts and
   Altmetric variables including AAS.
   RESULTS A total of 2467 articles were published in the study period.
   There were 351 articles excluded owing to missing Altmetric data. Of the
   2116 articles included in the analysis, 1039 (49.1\%) were published in
   2018, and 1077 (50.9\%) were published in 2019; the mean number of
   citations was 8.8 (95\% CI, 7.9-9.6) for AJO, 6.2 (95\% CI, 5.3-7.1) for
   JAMAO, and 15.1 (95\% CI, 13.3-17.0) for OPH. The mean AAS was 4.5 (95\%
   CI, 3.3-5.6) for AJO (723 publications), 27.4 (95\% CI, 22.1-32.8) for
   JAMAO (758 publications), and 15.1 (95\% CI, 10.9-19.3) for OPH (635
   publications). Citation rate was moderately correlated with AAS across
   the 3 journals (AJO, rho = 0.39; P < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.41; P < .001;
   OPH, rho = 0.40; P < .001), as well as minimally or moderately
   correlated with engagement or mention by Facebook posts (AJO, rho =
   0.38; P < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.24; P < .001; OPH, rho = 0.20; P < .001),
   news outlet reporting (AJO, rho = 0.12; P < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.38; P <
   .001; OPH, rho = 0.19; P < .001), and Twitter posts (AJO, rho = 0.40; P
   < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.38; P < .001; OPH, rho = 0.42; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this cross-sectional study suggest
   that citation rate has a moderate positive correlation with online and
   social media sharing of research in ophthalmology literature.
   Peer-reviewed journals may increase their reach and impact by sharing
   their literature through social media and online platforms.},

Abstract = {Purpose: An increasingly popular minimally invasive approach to
   resection of oropharyngeal / base-of-tongue cancer is made possible by a
   transoral technique conducted with the assistance of a surgical robot.
   However, the highly deformed surgical setup (neck flexed, mouth open,
   and tongue retracted) compared to the typical patient orientation in
   preoperative images poses a challenge to guidance and localization of
   the tumor target and adjacent critical anatomy. Intraoperative cone-beam
   CT (CBCT) can account for such deformation, but due to the low contrast
   of soft-tissue in CBCT images, direct localization of the target and
   critical tissues in CBCT images can be difficult. Such structures may be
   more readily delineated in preoperative CT or MR images, so a method to
   deformably register such information to intraoperative CBCT could offer
   significant value. This paper details the initial implementation of a
   deformable registration framework to align preoperative images with the
   deformed intraoperative scene and gives preliminary evaluation of the
   geometric accuracy of registration in CBCT-guided TORS.
   Method: The deformable registration aligns preoperative CT or MR to
   intraoperative CBCT by integrating two established approaches. The
   volume of interest is first segmented (specifically, the region of the
   tongue from the tip to the hyoid), and a Gaussian mixture (GM) mode1 of
   surface point clouds is used for rigid initialization (GMRigid) as well
   as an initial deformation (GMNonRigid). Next, refinement of the
   registration is performed using the Demons algorithm applied to distance
   transformations of the GM-registered and CBCT volumes. The registration
   accuracy of the framework was quantified in preliminary studies using a
   cadaver emulating preoperative and intraoperative setups. Geometric
   accuracy of registration was quantified in terms of target registration
   error (TRE) and surface distance error.
   Result: With each step of the registration process, the framework
   demonstrated improved registration, achieving mean TRE of 3.0 mm
   following the GM rigid, 1.9 mm following GM nonrigid, and 1.5 mm at the
   output of the registration process. Analysis of surface distance
   demonstrated a corresponding improvement of 2.2, 0.4, and 0.3 mm,
   respectively. The evaluation of registration error revealed the accurate
   alignment in the region of interest for base-of-tongue robotic surgery
   owing to point-set selection in the GM steps and refinement in the deep
   aspect of the tongue in the Demons step.
   Conclusions: A promising framework has been developed for CBCT-guided
   TORS in which intraoperative CBCT provides a basis for registration of
   preoperative images to the highly deformed intraoperative setup. The
   registration framework is invariant to imaging modality (accommodating
   preoperative CT or MR) and is robust against CBCT intensity variations
   and artifact, provided corresponding segmentation of the volume of
   interest. The approach could facilitate overlay of preoperative planning
   data directly in stereo-endoscopic video in support of CBCT-guided TORS.},

Abstract = {An issue has been identified with the diode tape used on the
   International Space Station (ISS) solar arrays to provide a high
   emittance surface for the underlying diodes. The diode tape consists of
   silicone pressure sensitive adhesive (Dow Coming QC-7725) with a
   protective Kapton over-layer to prevent sticking prior to solar array
   deployment. On-orbit, the Kapton over-layer will erode under exposure to
   atomic oxygen (AO). Under additional AO exposure, the underlying exposed
   silicone adhesive is expected to convert to a glass like silicate.
   Conventional thinking suggests that at some point, the Kapton will be
   eroded, exposing pure silicone adhesive. The silicone will lose its
   adhesive characteristics after some time as it converts to a silicate
   due to AO exposure. This presents a problem because the current
   operational plan to retract ISS solar array P6 and leave it stored under
   load for a long duration (6 months or more) may be incompatible with the
   timing of blocking minimization for the silicone adhesive. Previous
   testing by Lockheed-Martin Space Systems (LMSS) characterized silicone
   blocking following exposure to atomic oxygen (AO) in an electron
   cyclotron resonance (ECR) source facility. LMSS blocking test results,
   combined with analysis results of predicted ISS on-orbit AO exposure
   levels indicate the silicone blocking forces resulting from retraction
   and storage of the P6 4B solar array for an extended period of time may
   reach unacceptable levels. That is, the silicone may not be sufficiently
   converted to a silicate.
   The LMSS ECR source test results and their application to ISS on-orbit
   conditions are believed to be conservative. To address this
   conservatism, the Environment Effects Group at Marshall Space Flight
   Center, under direction from the ISS Program Office Environments Team,
   performed environments exposure testing with a high energy 5 eV AO beam
   along with near ultraviolet (NUV) radiation and ionizing radiation to
   more accurately simulate the actual on-orbit environment. Diode tape
   samples were exposed to each environment constituent individually, put
   under preload for seven days and then the resulting blocking force was
   measured using a tensile machine. Additional samples were exposed to AO,
   NUV and electrons in series and then put under long term (three to ten
   months) preload to determine the effect of preload duration on the
   resulting blocking force of the silicone-to-silicone bond.
   In this paper, we present the results of laboratory tests to determine
   the effect of space environment exposure (5 eV atomic oxygen,
   ultraviolet radiation, and electron radiation) on the blocking force of
   silicone adhesive in a silicone-to-silicone bond. Test results indicate
   that high energy AO, ultraviolet radiation and electron ionizing
   radiation exposure all reduce the blocking force for a
   silicone-to-silicone bond. AO exposure produces the most significant
   reduction in blocking force.},

Title = {LASER MICROSURGERY DEMONSTRATES THAT CYTOPLASMIC STRANDS ANCHORING THE
   NUCLEUS ACROSS THE VACUOLE OF PREMITOTIC PLANT-CELLS ARE UNDER TENSION -
   IMPLICATIONS FOR DIVISION PLANE ALIGNMENT},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {In epidermal cells of the plant Nautilocalyx lynchii, induced to divide
   by explantation, the nucleus undergoes a series of movements, on
   cytoplasmic strands, leading to construction of a division plane across
   the vacuole.  In the early stage, the nucleus separates from the cortex,
   occupying an eccentric position in the cell, suspended across the
   vacuole by few thin strands.  In the central stage, the nucleus occupies
   a central position anchored to the cortex by more numerous, thicker
   strands.  Finally, the phragmosome forms as a coalescence of cytoplasmic
   strands across the cell, constituting the division plane within which
   mitosis and cytokinesis take place.  The behaviour and alignment of
   these strands is therefore important since some are precursors of the
   division plane.
   In a previous paper (Flanders et al (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110,
   1111-1122), it was pointed out that the alignment of cytoplasmic strands
   showed features common to a variety of elements under tension.  That is,
   provided they are free to move relative to the cortex, strands radiating
   from the nucleus should tend to seek short rather than long routes to
   the cortex.  In this way, strands under tension would move away from
   distant cell corners where two of the cell's edges make a three-way
   junction with a neighbouring wall.  This provides a basis for the
   avoidance of four-way junctions and the maintenance of three-way
   junctions which are a characteristic feature of most plant tissues.  In
   addition, tensile elements such as soap bubble walls contact rigid
   surfaces perpendicularly.  Perpendicular attachment of the cell plate to
   the side wall is embodied in Sachs' rule of cell division and the
   existence of the premitotic strands in a state of tension would provide
   a basis for this rule.
   In this study, laser microsurgery has been used to confirm that strands
   connecting the premitotic nucleus to the cortex are under tension since
   the severed ends retract immediately upon severance.  However, the
   response of the nucleus to the breaking of a cytoplasmic strand by laser
   depends upon the particular stage.  The nucleus is most likely to move
   during the early stage when it is eccentrically placed and has few
   cytoplasmic strands.  In the middle and phragmosomal stages the nucleus
   is more resistant.  Computer-aided image reconstruction of
   anti-tubulin-labelled confocal sections indicates that the middle stage
   is characterised by thick microtubule (MT) bundles, which radiate from
   the nucleus and which seem to account for the increasing stabilization
   of the nucleus.  Although such strands are more difficult to sever with
   the laser, their ends still display elastic properties when cut.  It is
   proposed that tension is likely to influence the alignment of strands as
   well as the position of the nucleus during division plane formation in
   vacuolated cells.},

Title = {Paracetamol for low back pain},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2016},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Background
   Analgesic medication is the most frequently prescribed treatment for low
   back pain (LBP), of which paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended as
   the first choice medication. However, there is uncertainty about the
   efficacy of paracetamol for LBP.
   Objectives
   To investigate the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for non-specific
   LBP.
   Search methods
   We conducted searches on the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
   Trials (CENTRAL, which includes the Back and Neck Review Group trials
   register), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, LILACS, and
   IPA from their inception to 7 August 2015. We also searched the
   reference lists of eligible papers and trial registry websites (WHO
   ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov).
   Selection criteria
   We only considered randomised trials comparing the efficacy of
   paracetamol with placebo for non-specific LBP. The primary outcomes were
   pain and disability. We also investigated quality of life, function,
   adverse effects, global impression of recovery, sleep quality, patient
   adherence, and use of rescue medication as secondary outcomes.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently performed the data extraction and
   assessed risk of bias in the included studies. We also evaluated the
   quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We converted scales for
   pain intensity to a common 0 to 100 scale. We quantified treatment
   effects using mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratios
   for dichotomous outcomes. We used effect sizes and 95\% confidence
   intervals as a measure of treatment effect for the primary outcomes.
   When the treatment effects were smaller than 9 points on a 0 to 100
   scale, we considered the effect as small and not clinically important.
   Main results
   Our searches retrieved 4449 records, of which three trials were included
   in the review (n = 1825 participants), and two trials were included in
   the meta-analysis. For acute LBP, there is high-quality evidence for no
   difference between paracetamol (4 g per day) and placebo at 1 week
   (immediate term), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks (short term) for the
   primary outcomes. There is high-quality evidence that paracetamol has no
   effect on quality of life, function, global impression of recovery, and
   sleep quality for all included time periods. There were also no
   significant differences between paracetamol and placebo for adverse
   events, patient adherence, or use of rescue medication. For chronic LBP,
   there is very low-quality evidence (based on a trial that has been
   retracted) for no effect of paracetamol (1 g single intravenous dose) on
   immediate pain reduction. Finally, no trials were identified evaluating
   patients with subacute LBP.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found that paracetamol does not produce better outcomes than placebo
   for people with acute LBP, and it is uncertain if it has any effect on
   chronic LBP.},

Title = {Stability motion control and locomotion strategy of a crawling quadruped
   robot in the narrow space},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {33},
Pages = {4334-4344},
Abstract = {Work in the small space is a typical scene that people cannot enter. The
   interiors or access channels of many existing types of equipment are
   often designed according to the feasibility of human entry, which
   increases the design difficulty and often affects product performance.
   At the same time, internal operations are difficult and costly in the
   small space. The use of robots instead of labor can significantly
   improve efficiency and reduce costs, and equipment design, use and
   maintenance are of great significance. In order to cope with the complex
   environment that requires movement in a small space, research and
   development of a variety of robots have been carried out. Inspired by
   the gecko's ability to climb smoothly in a narrow space, this paper
   invented a gecko-like creeping motion mechanism and sticking to the sole
   of the foot. The motion stability of this kind of robot in a small
   space, especially the space with a limited width has become the core
   issue of robot motion planning. Based on a crawling quadruped robot
   platform, this paper first studies the stable motion control of the
   robot. Since the longitudinal stability margin (LSM) method only needs
   to consider the forward boundary and the backward boundary when judging
   the stability, the statically stable area (SSA) method simplifies the
   selection of the robot's support area. Using the advantages of the LSM
   method and the SSA method, a static stability algorithm and a center of
   gravity trajectory planning method for a crawling quadruped robot are
   proposed. This method improves the efficiency of trajectory planning by
   simplifying the stability margin constraint conditions and reducing the
   scope of the support region. It can be used for stable control of
   quadruped robots. Then, a motion strategy of a crawling quadruped robot
   in a narrow space with limited width is proposed. The limbs of the robot
   are extended in the front and rear directions and folded in the left and
   right directions to adapt to the limited width environment. According to
   the width constraint, the mathematical relationship between the body
   width and the movement step length in the retracted posture of the robot
   is deduced in detail, and the formula for calculating the step length
   under different width conditions is given. Finally, the test experiment
   is carried out on the crawling quadruped robot platform, and the forward
   and lateral stable movements of the robot are realized. The forward
   speed can reach 3 cm/s and the lateral speed can reach 2 cm/s; the robot
   is realized in a narrow space with limited width. The minimum channel
   width that can be passed is 32 cm (The overall width of the robot in the
   standard posture is 40 cm, and the width of the robot is reduced by 8
   cm), and the movement speed is 0.5 cm/s; during the movement, the roll
   angle changes within +/- 2 degrees, and the pitch angle changes within
   +/- 1 degrees; the creeping angle is verified. The feasibility of the
   motion strategy of a quadruped robot in a narrow space with limited
   width provides a method for the research on the motion control of a
   quadruped robot in a narrow space.},

Abstract = {The miniaturization of technology has led to an increasingly capable
   body of small satellites such as CubeSats which have fueled a demand for
   affordable yet reliable miniaturized attitude and orbit control systems.
   The more relaxed control requirements typically relevant to CubeSats
   missions open the door for innovative technologies that can replace
   large and expensive legacy attitude control and propulsion systems. The
   steadily increasing number of actors in space has also made orbital
   debris handling and mitigation increasingly important. This includes
   reducing the amount of debris, minimizing the risk of in-space
   collisions, and minimizing the hazards to persons and property on the
   ground from debris re-entry.
   The University of Florida Advanced Autonomous Multiple Spacecraft
   (ADAMUS) lab has developed a Drag De-Orbit Device (D3) for CubeSats
   consisting of retractable tape-spring booms that provide a drag area of
   .5 m(2) and can de-orbit a 12U, 15 kg CubeSat from a 700 km circular
   orbit in 25 years. By modulating the D3 drag area, orbital maneuvering
   can be performed and the host satellite can be made to de orbit in a
   desired location. In addition, the dart configuration of the booms
   ensures that the host satellite will aerodynamically stabilize in the
   ram direction with the help of initial rate damping by magnetorquers
   contained in the D3. By partially retracting two booms opposite each
   other, the D3 equipped spacecraft will have a clear minimum moment of
   inertia axis which gravity gradient torques will work to align with the
   nadir vector. These gravity gradient and aerodynamic torques together
   can provide passive 3-axis attitude stabilization.
   This paper details the design of a 2U CubeSat and mission that will be
   launched to validate the D3 and the orbital maneuvering, targeted
   re-entry, collision avoidance, and attitude stabilization algorithms
   developed by the ADAMUS lab. The targeted re-entry and orbital
   maneuvering algorithms have been tested extensively through Monte Carlo
   simulations and collision avoidance algorithms are currently in
   development. The CubeSat will consist of a standard 1U structure
   containing a power system, battery, GPS, UHF radio, and D3 control board
   with the D3 subsystem mounted to the back to achieve a 2U form factor.
   The search for CubeSat launch opportunities is still in progress, but
   the team hopes to have the satellite deployed from the International
   Space Station. Tests of orbital maneuvering and collision avoidance
   algorithms will commence after de-tumble, boom deployment, and
   communication with the ground. Approximately two weeks before the
   expected re-entry, the targeted de orbit algorithm will steer the
   satellite to a desired re-entry location visible by a JSpOC radar
   station. The radar tracking data along with GPS telemetry will be
   utilized to characterize the performance of the system and algorithms,
   update re-entry aero-thermodynamic models, and gauge the effectiveness
   of atmospheric density estimation techniques.},

Title = {Hydrodynamic model of the beaver-like bendable webbed foot and paddling
   characteristics under different flow velocities},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {234},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Bionic robots usually move forward in water with the swinging or
   paddling propulsion. Amphibious robots generally use webbed feet to
   paddle forward. Thus, the webbed foot is a key part to propel the body
   and numerously has multiple joints. The flippers interact with water to
   generate propulsive forces in propulsion phase, while the resistance is
   generated during the recovery phase. Therefore, the research on
   hydrodynamics of the webbed foot contributes to reveal the mechanism of
   the interaction between the paddling webbed foot and water and improve
   the paddling ability. At present, the feet of amphibious robots mostly
   adopt non-bending structure, which have great resistance in the
   retracting stage. At the same time, the existing hydrodynamic model does
   not take into account the changes in the flow velocity caused by the
   paddling, which results in the low performance of the bionic flippers
   and the inaccurate calculation of the hydrodynamic theory. In addition,
   at present there is no specific standard to measure the paddling ability
   of flippers, so the paddling performance cannot be accurately evaluated.
   In this paper, the beaver is used as a bionic object, and a platform of
   the beaver-like bendable webbed foot was constructed through the
   analysis of the structure and motion trajectories of beaver's flexible
   webbed foot. A hydrodynamic model of the beaver-like bendable webbed
   foot was established. Then three parameters, namely the paddling force
   factor, maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor were
   proposed as indicators to quantify the paddling performance of
   beaver-like webbed foot. Through the theoretical calculation and
   computational fluid dynamics simulation, the results verify that the
   proposed hydrodynamic calculation model is more accurate compared with
   the existing methods in different paddling trajectories of the
   beaver-like webbed foot under various flow velocities. Through
   hydrodynamic simulations of non-bending and bendable webbed foot under
   different flow velocities, it is found that the bendable webbed foot can
   effectively reduce the resistance of webbed foot in the recovery stage.
   Different trajectories and bending degrees of the webbed foot have
   different effects on the resistance of paddling. The webbed foot's
   paddling performance is quantitatively analyzed and clearly evaluated by
   calculating the paddling force factor, maximum flow velocity and
   compound paddling force factor under six trajectories of beaver-like
   webbed foot. It provides theoretical support for the trajectory planning
   of the webbed foot. On this basis, an improved motion trajectory is
   proposed by adding a pause process after the paddling propulsion stage
   of the beaver-like webbed foot, which can reduce the resistance
   generated by the water flow and improve the paddling performance. The
   hydrodynamic modeling of the beaverlike webbed foot and the study of the
   paddling characteristics under different flow velocities can provide a
   new method for the hydrodynamic research of underwater webbed bionic
   robots, and offer a quantifiable standard for the analysis of the
   paddling performance of the webbed foot, further promote the development
   of underwater bionic robot in hydrodynamic theory and motion performance

Abstract = {Theories of concurrency can be distinguished by the set of processes
   that they model, and by their choice of pre-ordering relation used to
   compare processes and to prove their correctness. For example, theories
   based on CCS are often pre-ordered by simulation (or more commonly
   bisimulation), of which the main varieties are strong or weak or barbed.
   Theories based on CSP choose as their pre-order a refinement relation,
   defined as inclusion over sets of observations. The main varieties of
   observation are just traces, or failures and/or divergences. The
   processes of the CSP model are restricted to those that satisfy certain
   naturally arising `healthiness conditions'. This paper gives a unifying
   treatment of simulation and refinement, and illustrates it by the
   familiar varieties of CCS and CSP that are mentioned above.
   We consider the variations two at a time. A link between two theories is
   a function L, which maps the processes of its source theory onto those
   of its target theory. The image of L defines exactly the set of
   processes of the target theory. The ordering relation of the target
   theory is obtained by applying the link L to one or both operands before
   applying the source theory ordering. We will use the normal transition
   rules of a structured operational semantics to define a series of
   linking functions: W for weak simulation, T for trace refinement, R for
   refusals, D for divergences. We then show that each function is a
   retraction, in the sense that it is idempotent and decreasing and (in
   most cases) monotonic in its source ordering. Finally, we show that
   certain compositions of these functions are also retractions.
   The definition of a retraction ensures that (1) the processes of the
   target theory are a subset of those of the source theory; (2) all
   ordering theorems of the source theory are preserved in the target
   theory; (3) the healthiness conditions of the target theory are
   expressed as fixed-point equivalences of the form p = Lp; (4)
   model-checking the target theory can be optimised, by applying L to only
   one of the two operands of the ordering. Finally, we show how the
   separately defined retractions can be composed in a way that preserves
   these important properties. In other words, the transition systems of
   several alternative versions of CCS, as well as the main standard
   versions of CSP, are retracts of the universal transition system that
   underlies CCS.
   The research reported here is a step towards completion of the
   unfinished business of the original ESPRIT Basic Research Action CONCUR
   {[}BRA 3009, 1989-92], which aimed to assimilate the theories and
   notations of CSP, ACP and CCS. A retraction is a good tool for this
   purpose, because it precisely codifies the similarities between the
   theories, and enables them to be used in combination, while preserving
   their essential and beneficial differences. Such unified families of
   theories may in due course serve as a rigorous foundation for a
   comprehensive programming toolset, one that provides reliable assistance
   at all stages of program design, development, testing and evolution. In
   this working draft, some of the later sections are incomplete.},

Title = {Arthroscopic debridement of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff:
   Retrospective multicenter study of 283 cases with 3-year follow-up},

Abstract = {Purpose of the study
   The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and radiological course
   of full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated by arthroscopic debridement
   and to discuss surgical indications according to patient demands and
   anatomical lesions.
   Material and methods
   This retrospective and multicentric study included patients with a
   minimal 3 years follow-up. The coronal extent of the supraspinatus tear
   was described as distal, intermediate or retracted. The sagittal extent
   to the infraspinatus and/or subscapularis and rotator interval was
   detailed. All patients were evaluated pre and post-operatively using
   Constant score and radiological A-P view for sub-acromial space
   measurement. In order to assess the influence of age, anatomical extent
   of the tear and follow-up, results were analyzed for 4 groups of
   patients according to their age: group I (19 cases less than 50 years),
   group II (88 cases from 51 to 60 years), group III (58 cases from 61 to
   65 years) and group IV (118 cases over 65 years). Results were finally
   evaluated according the arthroscopic procedure (isolated acromioplasty
   and biceps tenotomy, or association of both).
   Results
   283 patients, aged 63.1 years (range 32 to 82) entered this study. A
   complete antero-posterior tear of the supra-spinatus tendon was noticed
   in 93.2 p. 100 of cases. The tear extended to the infraspinatus tendon
   in 57.3 p. 100, and to the subscapularis tendon in 29 p. 100 of cases.
   The long head of the biceps was involved in 73 p. 100 of cases. 218
   acromioplasties and 116 biceps tenotomies were performed. The 2
   procedures were combined in nearly 25 p. 100 of cases. At final revision
   (mean follow-up of 4.7 years), 98 patients (34.6 p. 100) were very
   satisfied, 122 (43.1 p. 100) satisfied, 43 (15.2 p. 100) moderatly
   satisfied and 20 (7.1 p. 100) were disappointed. The average Constant
   score increased from 42.4 to 67.6 points. The radiological study showed
   a 1 mm narrowing of the sub-acromial space. Objective results were
   surprisingly good for group I at a 5.4 years follow-up but dropped from
   group II to group IV, mainly in relation with the extent of the tear. A
   deleterious effect of the isolated biceps tenotomy was demonstrated in
   case of subacromial space superior to 7 mm. Inversely after this
   procedure patients with a narrowed space improved.
   Discussion
   Even if traditional bias of retrospective and mullticentric study could
   not be avoided, the large number of patients and long follow-up of this
   study are superior to most of the published papers. The extent of the
   supraspinatus tear seems to progress during the 50-60 years decade.
   Objective results appeared to be much more related to the anatomical
   lesions than to the arthroscopic procedure.
   Conclusion
   This series did not demonstrate a secondary clinical or radiological
   deterioration after an endoscopic treatment without repair of
   full-tickness rotator cuff tears. Subacromial decompression and/or
   biceps tenotomy indications depend on age and extension of the tear.},

Title = {Fan-beam intensity modulated proton therapy},
Journal = {MEDICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents a concept for a proton therapy system
   capable of delivering intensity modulated proton therapy using a fan
   beam of protons. This system would allow present and future gantry-based
   facilities to deliver state-of-the-art proton therapy with the greater
   normal tissue sparing made possible by intensity modulation techniques.
   Methods: A method for producing a divergent fan beam of protons using a
   pair of electromagnetic quadrupoles is described and particle transport
   through the quadrupole doublet is simulated using a commercially
   available software package. To manipulate the fan beam of protons, a
   modulation device is developed. This modulator inserts or retracts
   acrylic leaves of varying thickness from subsections of the fan beam.
   Each subsection, or beam channel, creates what effectively becomes a
   beam spot within the fan area. Each channel is able to provide 0-255 mm
   of range shift for its associated beam spot, or stop the beam and act as
   an intensity modulator. Results of particle transport simulations
   through the quadrupole system are incorporated into the MCNPX Monte
   Carlo transport code along with a model of the range and intensity
   modulation device. Several design parameters were investigated and
   optimized, culminating in the ability to create topotherapy treatment
   plans using distal-edge tracking on both phantom and patient datasets.
   Results: Beam transport calculations show that a pair of electromagnetic
   quadrupoles can be used to create a divergent fan beam of 200 MeV
   protons over a distance of 2.1 m. The quadrupole lengths were 30 and 48
   cm, respectively, with transverse field gradients less than 20 T/m,
   which is within the range of water-cooled magnets for the quadrupole
   radii used. MCNPX simulations of topotherapy treatment plans suggest
   that, when using the distal edge tracking delivery method, many delivery
   angles are more important than insisting on narrow beam channel widths
   in order to obtain conformal target coverage. Overall, the sharp distal
   falloff of a proton depth-dose distribution was found to provide
   sufficient control over the dose distribution to meet objectives, even
   with coarse lateral resolution and channel widths as large as 2 cm.
   Treatment plans on both phantom and patient data show that dose
   conformity suffers when treatments are delivered from less than
   approximately ten angles. Treatment time for a sample prostate delivery
   is estimated to be on the order of 10 min, and neutron production is
   estimated to be comparable to that found for existing collimated
   systems.
   Conclusions: Fan beam proton therapy is a method of delivering intensity
   modulated proton therapy which may be employed as an alternative to
   magnetic scanning systems. A fan beam of protons can be created by a set
   of quadrupole magnets and modified by a dual-purpose range and intensity
   modulator. This can be used to deliver inversely planned treatments,
   with spot intensities optimized to meet user defined dose objectives.
   Additionally, the ability of a fan beam delivery system to effectively
   treat multiple beam spots simultaneously may provide advantages as
   compared to spot scanning deliveries. (C) 2013 American Association of

Title = {Nuts as a replacement for carbohydrates in the diabetic diet: a
   reanalysis of a randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {DIABETOLOGIA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1734-1747},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aims/hypothesis In line with current advice, we assessed the effect of
   replacing carbohydrate consumption with mixed nut consumption, as a
   source of unsaturated fat, on cardiovascular risk factors and HbA(1c) in
   type 2 diabetes. The data presented here are from a paper that was
   retracted at the authors' request (https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-rt02)
   owing to lack of adjustment for repeated measures in the same
   individual. Our aim, therefore, was to fix the error and add new
   complementary data of interest, including information on clotting
   factors and LDL particle size.
   Methods A total of 117 men and postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes
   who were taking oral glucose-lowering agents and with HbA(1c) between
   47.5 and 63.9 mmol/mol (6.5-8.0\%) were randomised after stratification
   by sex and baseline HbA(1c) in a parallel design to one of three diets
   for 3 months: (1) `full-dose nut diet' (n = 40): a diet with 2.0 MJ (477
   kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as mixed nuts (75 g/day);
   (2) `full-dose muffin diet' (n = 39): a diet with 1.97 MJ (471 kcal) per
   8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy provided as three whole-wheat muffins (188
   g/day), with a similar protein content to the nuts, and the same
   carbohydrate-derived energy content as the monounsaturated fatty
   acid-derived energy content in the nuts; or (3) `half-dose nut diet' (n
   = 38): a diet with 1.98 MJ (474 kcal) per 8.4 MJ (2000 kcal) energy
   provided as half portions of both the nuts and muffins. The primary
   outcome was change in HbA(1c). The study was carried out in a hospital
   clinical research centre and concluded in 2008. Only the statistician,
   study physicians and analytical technicians could be blinded to the
   group assessment.
   Results A total of 108 participants had post-intervention data available
   for analysis (full-dose nut group, n = 40; full-dose muffin group, n =
   35; half-dose nut group, n = 33). Compared with the full-dose muffin
   diet, the full-dose nut diet provided 9.2\% (95\% CI 7.1, 11.3) greater
   total energy intake from monounsaturated fat. The full-dose nut diet
   (median intake, 75 g/day) also reduced HbA(1c) compared with the
   full-dose muffin diet by -2.0 mmol/mol (95\% CI -3.8, -0.3 mmol/mol)
   (-0.19\% {[}95\% CI -0.35\%, -0.02\%]), (p = 0.026). Estimated
   cholesterol levels in LDL particles with a diameter < 255 Angstrom
   {[}LDL-c(< 255)]) and apolipoprotein B were also significantly decreased
   after the full-dose nut diet compared with the full-dose muffin diet.
   According to the dose response, the full-dose nut diet is predicted to
   reduce HbA(1c) (-2.0 mmol/mol {[}-0.18\%]; p = 0.044), cholesterol
   (-0.25 mmol/l; p = 0.022), LDL-cholesterol (-0.23 mmol/l; p = 0.019),
   non-HDL-cholesterol (-0.26 mmol/l; p = 0.020), apolipoprotein B (-0.06
   g/l, p = 0.013) and LDL-c <(255) (-0.42 mmol/l; p < 0.001). No serious
   study-related adverse events occurred, but one participant on the
   half-dose nut diet was hospitalised for atrial fibrillation after
   shovelling snow.
   Conclusions/interpretation Nut intake as a replacement for carbohydrate
   consumption improves glycaemic control and lipid risk factors in
   individuals with type 2 diabetes.},

Title = {Techniques for Anatomical Preparation of Dried Viscera and
   Angioarchitecture of Cranial Mesenteric Artery Branching of Dogs and
   Cats},
Journal = {ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Background: The study of the arterial vascularization of the abdominal
   cavity viscera is essential on the process of learning anatomy. For
   authors, various anatomical techniques can be used for the preservation
   of structures, allowing the exploration and visualization of the organs
   shape in many different ways. Among the techniques there is the
   angioarchitecture of viscera, with or without the utilization of
   formaldehyde. The aim of this paper is to describe a technique for
   anatomical preparation of the intestines (small and large) of dogs and
   cats using dried viscera and angioarchitecture, to facilitate the study
   and visualization of the cranial and caudal mesenteric arteries
   branching.
   Materials, Methods \& Results: Twenty pieces of intestine of dogs and
   two of cats were used. The intestine was removed from the duodenum to
   the cranial portion of the rectum, the root of the mesentery was
   sectioned as well as the cranial and caudal mesenteric arteries. The
   part was washed, then the caudal and cranial mesenteric and
   pancreaticoduodenal arteries were ligated, latex was injected in the
   cranial mesenteric artery and the sample remained immersed in a 10\%
   acetic acid aqueous solution. The cranial portion of the rectum was
   ligated and, through a cannula into the duodenum, air was insufflated
   until the viscera were distended. Following that, the part was
   positioned and fixed, exposed to continuous ventilation until complete
   drying and sprayed with turpentine, insect repellent and varnish. After
   thirty days, the samples were conditioned, fifteen in a glass cabinet
   and seven, isolated, in closed boxes, with a significant difference
   between the types of conditioning regarding the proliferation of fungi
   and insect invasion. After four months of preparation it was possible to
   observe that the distension each viscera had changed.
   Discussion: There are few standardized protocols regarding the
   preparation of dried viscera angioarchitecture, more particularly, of
   intestines. Latex is more effective for the display of structures with
   larger calibers and, in addition, this material does not retract and
   does not alter the vessel walls, being moderately resistant and elastic
   when solidified. For these reasons it was the chosen material for the
   development of this project. Regarding the technique of dry viscera
   preparation of the digestive system, it is indicated to isolate the
   segments of intestine removing the mesentery, but in this study it was
   maintained, preserving the organ anatomy. The latex injection technique
   can be performed in several ways due to the large number of vessels to
   be cannulated. In this study, the cranial mesenteric artery was
   cannulated after removal of the viscera from the abdominal cavity and
   without any difficulty. Preparation of the part proceeded, keeping the
   intestinal segments united, facilitating the visualization of vessels.
   Samples maintained separately in boxes had its aspect better preserved
   than those who remained in a larger space. Authors report that viscera
   with excessive fat should be treated with carbon tetrachloride or a
   similar solvent in order to prevent deterioration. In this research 30\%
   of the preparations had their final aspect impaired, even with the use
   of turpentine. According to the findings it is possible to conclude that
   the technique of angioarchitectonic molding of dry intestines of dogs
   and cats is feasible, has low cost and allows excellent visualization of
   arterial branching and easy handling. It features also some technical
   advantages such as reducing the weight of the parts, avoiding the use of
   tanks of formaldehyde and allowing its use for a virtually unlimited
   period.},

Title = {Collision and rebound of small droplets in an incompressible continuum
   gas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {454},
Pages = {145-201},
Month = {MAR 10},
Abstract = {We study the head-on collision between two weakly deformable droplets,
   each of radius a (in the range 10-150 mum), moving towards one another
   with characteristic impact speeds +/-U-c'. The liquid comprising the
   drop has density rho(d) and Viscosity mu(d). The collision takes place
   in an incompressible continuum gas with ambient density rho(g) much less
   than rho(d), ambient pressure p(infinity)' and viscosity mu(g) much less
   than mu(d). The gas-liquid interface is surfactant free with interfacial
   tension c. The Weber number based on the drop density, We(d) equivalent
   to rho(d)U(c)('2)a/sigma much less than 1 and the capillary number based
   on the gas viscosity, Ca-g equivalent to mug U-c'/sigma much less than
   1. The Reynolds number characterizing flow inside the drops satisfies
   Re-d equivalent to aU(c)'rho(d)/mu(d) much greater than We(d)(1/2) and
   the Stokes number characterizing the drop inertia, St equivalent to
   2We(d)(9Ca(g))(-1) equivalent to 2(rho(d)U(c)'amu(g)(-1))/9 is O(1) or
   larger.
   We first analyse a simple model for the rebound process which is valid
   when St much greater than 1 and viscous dissipation in both the gas and
   in the drop can be neglected. We assume that the film separating the
   drops only serves to keep the interfaces from touching by supplying a
   constant excess pressure 2sigma/a. A singular perturbation analysis
   reveals that when ln(We(d)(-1/4)) much greater than 1, rebound occurs on
   a time scale t(b)' = 2/3(1/2) piaWe(d)(1/2)ln(1/2)
   (We(d)(-1/4))U-c'(-1). Numerical results for Weber numbers in the range
   O(10(-6))-O(10(-1)) compare very well to existing experimental and
   simulation results, indicating that the approximate treatment of the
   bounce process is applicable for We(d) < 0.3.
   In the second part of the paper we formulate a general theory that not
   only models the flow inside the drop but also takes into account the
   evolution of the gap width separating the drops. The drop deformation in
   the near-contact inner region is determined by solving the lubrication
   equations and matching to an outer solution. The resulting equations are
   solved numerically using a direct, semi-implicit, matrix inversion
   technique for capillary numbers in the range 10(-8) to 10(-4) and Stokes
   numbers from 2 to 200. Trajectories are mapped out in terms of Ca-g and
   the parameter chi = (We(d)/Ca-g)(1/2) so that St equivalent to
   2/9chi(2). For small Stokes numbers, the drops behave as nearly rigid
   spheres and come to rest without any significant rebound. For 0(1)
   Stokes numbers, the surfaces deform noticeably and a dimple forms when
   the gap thickness is approximately O(aCa(g)(1/2)). The dimple extent
   increases, reaches a maximum and then decreases to zero. Meanwhile, the
   centroids of the two drops come to rest momentarily and then the drops
   rebound, executing oscillatory motions before finally coming to rest. As
   the Stokes number increases with Cag held fixed, more energy is stored
   as deformation energy and the maximum radial extent of the dimple
   increases accordingly. For St much greater than 1, no oscillations in
   the centroid positions are observed, but the temporal evolution of the
   minimum gap thickness exhibits two minima. One minimum occurs during the
   dimple evolution process and corresponds to the minimum attained by the
   dimple rim. The second minimum occurs along the axis of symmetry when
   the dimple relaxes, a tail forms and then retracts. A detailed analysis
   of the interface shapes, pressure profiles and the force acting on the
   drops allows us to obtain a complete picture of the collision and
   rebound process.},

Title = {Interventions for treating persistent pain in survivors of torture},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Background
   Persistent (chronic) pain is a frequent complaint in survivors of
   torture, particularly but not exclusively pain in the musculoskeletal
   system. Torture survivors may have no access to health care; where they
   do, they may not be recognised when they present, and the care available
   often falls short of their needs. There is a tendency in state and
   non-governmental organisations' services to focus on mental health, with
   poor understanding of persistent pain, while survivors may have many
   other legal, welfare, and social problems that take precedence over
   health care.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy of interventions for treating persistent pain and
   associated problems in survivors of torture.
   Search methods
   We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any
   language in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, LILACS,
   and PsycINFO, from database inception to 1 February 2017. We also
   searched trials registers and grey literature databases.
   Selection criteria
   RCTs of interventions of any type (medical, physical, psychological)
   compared with any alternative intervention or no intervention, and with
   a pain outcome. Studies needed to have at least 10 participants in each
   arm for inclusion.
   Data collection and analysis
   We identified 3578 titles in total after deduplication; we selected 24
   full papers to assess for eligibility. We requested data from two
   completed trials without published results.
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We
   assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated standardised
   mean difference (SMD) and effect sizes with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI). We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a `Summary of
   findings' table.
   Main results
   Three small published studies (88 participants) met the inclusion
   criteria, but one had been retracted from publication because of ethical
   problems concerned with confidentiality and financial irregularities.
   Since these did not affect the data, the study was retained in this
   review. Despite the search including any intervention, only two types
   were represented in the eligible studies: two trials used cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) with biofeedback versus waiting list on
   unspecified persistent pain (58 participants completed treatment), and
   one examined the effect of complex manual therapy versus self-treatment
   on low back pain (30 participants completed treatment). Excluded studies
   were largely either not RCTs or did not report pain as an outcome.
   There was no difference for the outcome of pain relief at the end of
   treatment between CBT and waiting list (two trials, 58 participants;
   SMD-0.05, 95\% CI-1.23 to 1.12) (very low quality evidence); one of
   these reported a three- month follow-up with no difference between
   intervention and comparison (28 participants; SMD-0.03, 95\% CI-0.28 to
   0.23) (very low quality evidence). The manual therapy trial also
   reported no difference between complex manual therapy and self-treatment
   (30 participants; SMD-0.48, 95\% CI 9.95 to 0.35) (very low quality
   evidence). Two studies reported dropouts, one with partial information
   on reasons; none of the studies reported adverse effects.
   There was no information from any study on the outcomes of use of
   analgesics or quality of life.
   Reduction in disability showed no difference at the end of treatment
   between CBT and waiting list (two trials, 57 participants; SMD-0.39,
   95\% CI-1.17 to 0.39) (very low quality evidence); one of these reported
   a three-month follow-up with no difference between intervention and
   comparison (28 participants; SMD 0, 95\% CI-0.74 to 0.74) (very low
   quality evidence). The manual therapy trial reported superiority of
   complex manual therapy over self-treatment for reducing disability (30
   participants; SMD-1.10, 95\% CI 1.88 to -0.33) (very low quality
   evidence).
   Reduction in distress showed no difference at the end of treatment
   between CBT and waiting list (two trials, 58 participants; SMD 0.07,
   95\% CI-0.46 to 0.60) (very low quality evidence); one of these reported
   a three-month follow-up with no difference between intervention and
   comparison (28 participants; SMD-0.24, 95\% CI-0.50 to 0.99) (very low
   quality evidence). The manual therapy trial reported superiority of
   complex manual therapy over self-treatment for reducing distress (30
   participants; SMD-1.26, 95\% CI 2.06 to-0.47) (very low quality
   evidence).
   The risk of bias was considered high given the small number of trials,
   small size of trials, and the likelihood that each was underpowered for
   the comparisons it reported. We primarily downgraded the quality of the
   evidence due to small numbers in trials, lack of intentionto-treat
   analyses, high unaccounted dropout, lack of detail on study methods, and
   CIs around effect sizes that included no effect, benefit, and harm.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any
   intervention for persistent pain in survivors of torture.},

Title = {Mediterranean-style diet for the primary and secondary prevention of
   cardiovascular disease},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2019},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Background
   The Seven Countries study in the 1960s showed that populations in the
   Mediterranean region experienced lower coronary heart disease (CHD)
   mortality probably as a result of different dietary patterns. Later
   observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a
   Mediterranean dietary pattern on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
   factors but clinical trial evidence is more limited.
   Objectives
   To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean-style diet for the
   primary and secondary prevention of CVD.
   Search methods
   We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central
   Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 9); MEDLINE (Ovid,
   1946 to 25 September 2018); Embase (Ovid, 1980 to 2018 week 39); Web of
   Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, 1900 to 26 September 2018);
   DARE Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library); HTA Issue 4 of 4, 2016
   (Cochrane Library); NHS EED Issue 2 of 4, 2015 (Cochrane Library). We
   searched trial registers and applied no language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in healthy adults and
   adults at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) and those with
   established CVD (secondary prevention). Both of the following key
   components were required to reach our definition of a
   Mediterranean-style diet: high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio (use
   of olive oil as main cooking ingredient and/or consumption of other
   traditional foods high in monounsaturated fats such as tree nuts) and a
   high intake of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables and
   legumes. Additional components included: low to moderate red wine
   consumption; high consumption of whole grains and cereals; low
   consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish;
   moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The intervention could
   be dietary advice, provision of relevant foods, or both. The comparison
   group received either no intervention, minimal intervention, usual care
   or another dietary intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and
   CVD risk factors. We included only studies with follow-up periods of
   three months or more defined as the intervention period plus post
   intervention follow-up.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion,
   extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted four main
   comparisons:
   1. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus no intervention or minimal
   intervention for primary prevention;
   2. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary
   intervention for primary prevention;
   3. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus usual care for secondary
   prevention;
   4. Mediterranean dietary intervention versus another dietary
   intervention for secondary prevention.
   Main results
   In this substantive review update, 30 RCTs (49 papers) (12,461
   participants randomised) and seven ongoing trials met our inclusion
   criteria. The majority of trials contributed to primary prevention:
   comparisons 1 (nine trials) and 2 (13 trials). Secondary prevention
   trials were included for comparison 3 (two trials) and comparison 4
   (four trials plus an additional two trials that were excluded from the
   main analyses due to published concerns regarding the reliability of the
   data).
   Two trials reported on adverse events where these were absent or minor
   (low- to moderate-quality evidence). No trials reported on costs or
   health-related quality of life.
   Primary prevention
   The included studies for comparison 1 did not report on clinical
   endpoints (CVD mortality, total mortality or non-fatal endpoints such as
   myocardial infarction or stroke). The PREDIMED trial (included in
   comparison 2) was retracted and re-analysed following concerns regarding
   randomisation at two of 11 sites. Low-quality evidence shows little or
   no effect of the PREDIMED (7747 randomised) intervention (advice to
   follow a Mediterranean diet plus supplemental extra-virgin olive oil or
   tree nuts) compared to a low-fat diet on CVD mortality (hazard ratio
   (HR) 0.81, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.32) or total
   mortality (HR 1.0, 95\% CI 0.81 to 1.24) over 4.8 years. There was,
   however, a reduction in the number of strokes with the PREDIMED
   intervention (HR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.45 to 0.80), a decrease from 24/1000 to
   14/1000 (95\% CI 11 to 19), moderate-quality evidence). For CVD risk
   factors for comparison 1 there was low-quality evidence for a possible
   small reduction in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95\% CI -0.32 to
   0.00) and moderate-quality evidence for a reduction in systolic (-2.99
   mmHg (95\% CI -3.45 to -2.53) and diastolic blood pressure (-2.0 mmHg,
   95\% CI-2.29 to -1.71), with low or very low-quality evidence of little
   or no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. For comparison
   2 there was moderate-quality evidence of a possible small reduction in
   LDL cholesterol (-0.15 mmol/L, 95\% CI -0.27 to -0.02) and triglycerides
   (-0.09 mmol/L, 95\% CI -0.16 to -0.01) with moderate or low-quality
   evidence of little or no effect on total or HDL cholesterol or blood
   pressure.
   Secondary prevention
   For secondary prevention, the Lyon Diet Heart Study (comparison 3)
   examined the effect of advice to follow a Mediterranean diet and
   supplemental canola margarine compared to usual care in 605 CHD patients
   over 46 months and there was low-quality evidence of a reduction in
   adjusted estimates for CVD mortality (HR 0.35, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.82) and
   total mortality (HR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.21 to 0.92) with the intervention.
   Only one small trial (101 participants) provided unadjusted estimates
   for composite clinical endpoints for comparison 4 (very low-quality
   evidence of uncertain effect). For comparison 3 there was low-quality
   evidence of little or no effect of a Mediterranean-style diet on lipid
   levels and very low-quality evidence for blood pressure. Similarly, for
   comparison 4 where only two trials contributed to the analyses there was
   low or very low-quality evidence of little or no effect of the
   intervention on lipid levels or blood pressure.
   Authors' conclusions
   Despite the relatively large number of studies included in this review,
   there is still some uncertainty regarding the effects of a
   Mediterranean-style diet on clinical endpoints and CVD risk factors for
   both primary and secondary prevention. The quality of evidence for the
   modest benefits on CVD risk factors in primary prevention is low or

Title = {THE TOWN OF PAG - AN EXAMPLE OF A 15TH CENTURY ``REAL TOWN{''}},

Abstract = {The town of Pag, situated on the homonymous island in North Dalmatia is
   a unique example of a completely planned urban space whose construction
   started in 1443. In the course of the following thirty years, it mainly
   witnessed the execution of the final design stages which included the
   construction of town walls. They represent an original example of urban
   planning which has been well attested by archival documents. The
   creation of this new town, Citta Nouva, was said to have been prompted
   by the decision to relocate a smaller settlement called Old Pag which
   had been during the Trecento the centre of the insular community due to
   ancient salt plants built within the spacious bay in the centre of the
   uninhabited side of the island. The prehistoric and ancient Roman
   settlements with the capital Cissa were situated in a fertile valley
   further to the north, whereas Novalia contemporary Novalja, was a
   settlement which developed during late antiquity exclusively as a sea
   port. The ethno-political changes that occurred during the early Middle
   Ages led to the abandonment of these settlements since the development
   of commerce on the Adriatic coast and in its hinterland stimulated
   construction of salt plants which came to be in the end of the 14th
   century the biggest salt plants in the Croatian Littoral. Important
   natural resources were the reason the area was desired by Zadar, the
   town that in many respects presented competition to Venice. In order to
   defend themselves from constant military upsurges, the islanders of Pag
   voluntarily consented to the protection offered by Venice and in 1409
   the island became part of Venice's Stato del Mar. This meant colonial
   dependence of the island of Pag on the imperial power of Serenissima,
   but also encouragement to the economic growth of the local community.
   Due to a misfortunate position of Old Pag, its community decided to move
   closer to the salt plants, which was also in the interest of Venice in
   that it eagerly wanted to keep its monopolistic position in salt trade.
   The establishment of New Pag was therefore approved by the Venice dodge
   and it took place on the site which was compared to that of Old Pag more
   appropriate for organized life of the community and maritime connection
   to the main centre of the Venetian Republic. According to written
   sources the foundations of St Mary's Church and of the main fort near
   the entrance to the town from the port were laid in 1443. Both buildings
   were built on the site which was soon after divided into four unequal
   quarters of the future town. The town was constructed gradually, but the
   planimetry of the site clearly shows that all components necessary for
   the town's functions were rationally planned from the very beginning.
   Particularities of the net-like system of streets attest primarily to
   the axial communication between the salt plants in the east and the port
   in the western part of the town, while the cardo of the transversally
   positioned Strada magna form the cross shaped plan with a square in the
   centre. Although geometrically completely irregular, the quadrangle
   space comprises the most important facilities for urban life: the
   Rectors' palace and the tower with a public clock positioned diagonally
   to the largest church and facing the communal loggia later on destroyed,
   situated on the opposite side of the parish church, and the Bishop's
   palace which never saw completion. Residential quarters were built in
   blocks composed of rows of axially attached private houses and
   perpendicularly positioned to the main road which was at places
   double-laned. In the northern section of the town the blocks were formed
   by two densely built rows of small houses, clearly intended for lower
   classes. In contrast, the rows in the southern section are double in
   size since they contained more spacious houses with back yards belonging
   to richer families. This social stratification was already established
   in the very cadastre which also confirms the morphological quality of
   the architecture although lagging behind the architectural achievements
   in other towns of the Venetian province of Dalmatia.
   The urban features of Novi Pag, congruent in typology to the
   town-colonies related to semi-industrial production, have been attested
   by the modest fortified walls which entirely surrounded the town. Their
   irregular pentagonal shape with each side adjusted to the terrain and
   defence strategy formed a ring around the town. The western side of the
   fortification retracted towards the town centre providing thus better
   protection of the port with the most strongly built corner forts. The
   south side faced the salt plants with warehouses and controlled the
   approaching space in front of them together with the western, shorter
   and functionally most neutral side. The longest, northern side
   protruding in a triangle-like formation contained a town gate facing the
   island fields. The walls of the fortification containing an interior
   corridor were easily and quickly accessible in case of enemy attacks.
   A more thorough analysis of town planning and design, which can be
   detected in the present urban core of Pag, reveals detailed rational
   approach to urban development guided by the politics of organized local
   administration and strategy of the powerful state authorities. If
   observed from within that context, a question might arise about the true
   origin of Pag which seems to be the centre of the enigma including
   arrivals of the most significant artists of the Croatian Quattrocento to
   Pag as well as interpretations of Pag as the precursor of the
   Renaissance ideal town. Attempting to dispel such misconceptions, this
   text draws attention to fragmentary records of terrain measurement
   performed by Venetian military engineers by which Citta Nuova was
   divided into quarters. Subsequently, in 1460, the galley commander
   Andrea Buon made the measurement of the wider are of the town. The fact
   that the Senate of the Venetian Republic for years allotted 300 ducats
   for the construction of Pag and even controlled land exchange supports
   the premise that the Venetian centralist state had a decided role in
   conceiving the initial urban project of Pag. The execution of the
   concept design must have been handed to the local authorities and
   aristocrats who commissioned builders from southern Adriatic towns. The
   most esteemed among them, Giorgio Mathei Dalmaticus, had until 1466
   participated as a building contractor in the construction of the
   fortification, while other building work was done by his collaborators
   among who there was not a single foreigner. That is the reason the
   entire architectural heritage of Pag, with unsubstantial number of
   sculptural works conforms to the artistic character of the coastal
   Croatia. The paper further supports the view that New Pag should be
   valued as an exceptional example of ``real town{''} adapted to the
   achievements of mature humanism in the Eastern Adriatic without
   insisting on stylistically defining it in terms of Renaissance which has
   been attempted, though questionably, in the history of urban theory and
   practice.},
