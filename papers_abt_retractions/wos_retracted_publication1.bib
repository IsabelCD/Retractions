Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to characterize trends related
   to retracted publications within radiology journals.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. PubMed was queried to identify all articles with
   the publication type ``retracted publication{''} or ``notification of
   retraction.{''} Articles published within radiology journals were
   identified using Journal Citation Reports' journal categories. Available
   versions of original articles and publication notices were accessed from
   journal websites. Citations to retracted publications were identified
   using Web of Science. Overall trends were assessed.
   RESULTS. Forty-eight retracted original research articles were
   identified within radiology journals since 1983, which included 1.1\% of
   all PubMed ``retracted publication{''} entries. Distinct PubMed entries
   were available for the retracted publication and retraction notification
   in 39 of 48 articles. The original PDF was available for 37 articles,
   although the articles were not watermarked as retracted in 23 cases. In
   six cases with a watermarked PDF, further searches identified
   nonwatermarked versions. Original HTML versions were available for 13
   articles but 11 were not watermarked. The mean (+/- SD) delay between
   publication and retraction was 2.7 +/- 2.8 years (range, 0-16 years).
   The mean number of citations to retracted articles was 10.9 +/- 17.1
   (range, 0-94 citations). Reasons for retraction included problematic or
   incorrect methods or results (although it typically was unclear whether
   these represented honest errors or misconduct) in 33.3\% of cases,
   complete or partial duplicate publication in 33.3\% of cases, plagiarism
   in 14.6\% of cases, a permission issue in 8.3\% of cases, the
   publisher's error in 6.3\% of cases, and no identified reason in 6.3\%
   of cases. One or no retractions occurred annually from 1986 to 2001,
   although two or more retractions occurred annually in nine of the 12
   years from 2002 through 2013.
   CONCLUSION. Retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially
   increasing, issue within radiology journals that publishers have
   inconsistently and insufficiently addressed. Greater awareness and
   training in proper biomedical research conduct, as well as establishment
   and enforcement of standardized publishers' policies, are warranted.},

Title = {Retracted publications and their citation in dental literature: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DENTAL RESEARCH},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives The present systematic review aimed to perform an in-depth
   analysis of the different features of retracted publications in the
   dental field.
   Material and methods This review has been recorded in the PROSPERO
   database (CRD42017075634). Two independent reviewers performed an
   electronic search (Pubmed, Retraction Watch) for retracted articles in
   dental literature up to December 31, 2018.
   Results 180 retracted papers were identified, the first published in
   2001. Retractions increased by 47\% in the last four-year period
   (2014-2018), when compared with 2009-2013 (94 and 64 retracted
   publications, respectively). Author misconduct was the most common
   reason for retraction (65.0\%), followed by honest scientific errors
   (12.2\%) and publisher-related issues (10.6\%). The majority of
   retracted research was conducted in Asia (55.6\%), with 49 papers
   written in India (27.2\%). 552 researchers (89\%) are listed as authors
   in only one retracted article, while 10 researchers (1.6\%) are present
   in five or more retracted publications. Retracted articles were cited
   530 times after retraction: the great majority of these citations
   (89.6\%) did not consider the existence of the retraction notice and
   treated data from retracted articles as reliable.
   Conclusions Retractions in dental literature have constantly increased
   in recent years, with the majority of them due to misconduct and fraud.
   The publication of unreliable research has many negative consequences.
   Studies derived from such material are designed on potentially incorrect
   bases, waste funds and resources, and most importantly, increase risk of
   incorrect treatment for patients. Citation of retracted papers
   represents a major issue for the scientific community.},

Abstract = {The number of articles published in open access journals (OAJs) has
   increased dramatically in recent years. Simultaneously, the quality of
   publications in these journals has been called into question. Few
   studies have explored the retraction rate from OAJs. The purpose of the
   current study was to determine the reasons for retractions of articles
   from OAJs in biomedical research. The Medline database was searched
   through PubMed to identify retracted publications in OAJs. The journals
   were identified by the Directory of Open Access Journals. Data were
   extracted from each retracted article, including the time from
   publication to retraction, causes, journal impact factor, and country of
   origin. Trends in the characteristics related to retraction were
   determined. Data from 621 retracted studies were included in the
   analysis. The number and rate of retractions have increased since 2010.
   The most common reasons for retraction are errors (148), plagiarism
   (142), duplicate publication (101), fraud/suspected fraud (98) and
   invalid peer review (93). The number of retracted articles from OAJs has
   been steadily increasing. Misconduct was the primary reason for
   retraction. The majority of retracted articles were from journals with
   low impact factors and authored by researchers from China, India, Iran,
   and the USA.},

Abstract = {Background: Retraction is a mechanism for correcting the literature and
   a warning for readers in relation to publications that contain serious
   flaws or erroneous data. As a result of growth and development of
   Iranian publications in the last two decades, that brings unethical
   behavior of researchers led to retraction of their publications. We
   aimed to investigate Iranian retracted publications indexed in PubMed
   database.
   Methods: All Iranian retracted publications published in PubMed up to
   Dec 2017 have been retrieved. Bibliographic information of retracted
   publications, retraction notice, time lag between article publication
   date and the date of retraction notice, reasons of retraction, Issuer of
   retraction and acknowledge information of retracted publication were
   recorded. Additionally, citation data of retracted publications before
   2013 were analyzed.
   Results: Overall, 164 Iranian retracted publications were identified.
   Meantime lag was 20.8 months. ``Islamic Azad University{''} and ``Tehran
   University of Medical Sciences (TUMS){''} were two affiliations that
   have received highest number of retracted publications. The most issuer
   of retraction publications was editor-in-chief and the most mentioned
   reasons for retractions were authorship issues, plagiarism, and
   redundant publication. Thirty-three (20.12\%) publications have received
   funds from various agencies. Citation study of retracted publications
   indicates that these publications have received 789 citations (Citation
   per publicarion=11.6).
   Conclusion: Although Iranian retracted publications represent small
   portion of all Iranian publications, but the number of retracted
   publications has increased. More than half of retracted publications
   have had authorship issues and plagiarism that requires more attention
   to research ethics authorities.},

Abstract = {To describe the impact of the retracted publications on the scientific
   community more comprehensively, this paper introduces the impact of
   retracted publications on technology. It establishes a multi-dimensional
   observation framework for retracted publications from four dimensions,
   including scientific impact, technological impact, funding impact and
   Altmetric impact, and proposes the use of a novel multidimensional
   bubble diagram to illustrate the multidimensional data. This study also
   proposes a two-dimensional classification of retraction reasons to help
   sort retracted papers, the results of which show the correlated features
   of those papers. This paper takes all the retracted publications from
   two top biomedical journals as a sample, uses the observation framework
   to analyze them and describes the impact of these papers from multiple
   dimensions. The results show that compared with one-dimensional
   analysis, this observation framework reveals the impact characteristics
   of retracted publications more comprehensively.},

Abstract = {The number of retracted articles with Chinese authors has raised much
   attention, but no systematic study has specifically explored the
   retraction of academic publications by researchers from mainland China.
   Here, we determined the characteristics of retracted publications from
   mainland China in the biomedical literature. We searched the Medline
   database through PubMed and Web of Science to identify retracted
   publications with first authors from mainland China. Data for 825
   retracted studies were included in the analysis. The number and rate of
   retractions have increased since 1999. We found that 651 retractions
   were for articles published in journals with relatively low impact
   factors (< 5). Commonest reasons for retraction were plagiarism (192),
   errors (159), duplicate publication (143), and invalid peer review
   (137). Authors of retracted articles were from 28 of the 31 provinces in
   mainland China. The number of retracted articles from mainland China has
   shown an increasing trend. Misconduct was the primary reason for
   retraction. Retracted articles originated from most provinces in China
   and were published in numerous journals. These findings indicate that
   misconduct issues are widespread in China. Results of this study
   highlight the need to take measures to prevent misconduct among Chinese
   researchers.},

Abstract = {Scientific collaboration has considerably grown in recent years, and has
   been recognized as a positive factor for research productivity and
   quality. This study is aimed at exploring the collaboration in retracted
   publications and the influence on different kinds of scientific
   misbehaviors based on 4842 retracted publications in Web of Science Core
   Collection from 1978 to 2017. Search results showed that the proportion
   of international collaborations in retracted publications has fluctuated
   at around 20\% in the past 17 years, and different collaboration
   patterns of major countries are revealed. The USA and China contributed
   to more than half of all retracted publications, while retraction rate
   of Chinese papers was three times higher compared to papers from the
   USA. A negative correlation between the proportion of internationally
   collaborative publications and the retraction rate was found. Countries
   involved in more international collaborations tend to have lower
   retraction rates. Also, the occurrences of plagiarism was found to be
   lower when a paper is contributed by more authors, while falsification
   or manipulation, errors or unreliable results appeared more frequently
   under the same condition. Conclusions are made with a focus on the need
   for more actions to strengthen the scientific norms and integrity within
   collaborative groups.},

Abstract = {Retracted publications are the special literature carriers revealing
   scientific errors and misconduct. Based on Web of Science, this paper
   accessed the authoritative and plentiful retracted publications through
   heterogeneous multi-source data and effective retrieval strategies.
   Then, the informetric analysis was performed on the retracted
   publications with a focus on the timeline, geological locations,
   disciplines, journals, institutions, and authors. Current findings show
   that there is a growing number of retracted publications worldwide as
   well as in mainland China. Recidivist and large-scale centralized
   publication retractions have exerted numerous influences on the changes
   in the number of retracted publications. Countries with strong
   scientific research capabilities have more retracted publications. In
   addition, the number of retracted publications has significant
   differences corresponding to different disciplines. Specifically, life
   science is a typical field that the retraction of scientific
   publications frequently occurred, which can also be seen in partial
   interdisciplinary publications. In terms of journals, which are counted
   as small group but with a high ratio of retraction should be further
   investigated. The institutions with more publications retracted can be
   divided into three types: institutions with more and scattered
   disciplines, institutions with more but concentrated disciplines, and
   institutions with fewer and concentrated disciplines. Recidivists are
   the focus at the author level and have quite different specific
   behavioral patterns. The main findings from the research are of great
   informetric value for the theoretical research on scientific norms and
   the practices of scientific research integrity supervision.},

Title = {Retracted Publications in Medical Imaging Literature: an Analysis Using
   the Retraction Watch Database},

Abstract = {Rationale and Objective: It is currently unknown how many publications
   in the medical imaging literature are retracted and for which reasons.
   The purpose of this study was to perform an updated analysis on
   retracted medical imaging publications using the Retraction Watch
   Database. Materials and Methods: The Retraction Watch Database was
   searched for all retracted publications in the subject category
   ``Radiology/ Imaging{''} (no beginning date limit, search update until
   April 27, 2022). Reasons for retraction were extracted using
   standardized coding taxonomy. The number of citations per retracted
   publication was determined. Spearman's rho was used for statistical
   analysis. Results: 192 retractions, originally published between 1984
   and 2021, were included. Most retractions originated from China
   (31.3\%), the United States (12.5\%), Japan (7.3\%), and South Korea
   (6.3\%). The number of retractions increased over the years, especially
   since 2000 (Spearman's rho=0.764, p <0.001). Delay between original
   publication and retraction ranged from 0 days to 14 years and 3 months
   (median of 11 months). Most common reasons for retraction were
   duplication of article (7.1\%), plagiarism of article (6.8\%), concerns/
   issues about data (5.4\%), investigation by company/institution (4.5\%),
   and forged authorship (4.0\%). Scientific misconduct was deemed present
   in 107 of 192 retracted articles (55.7\%). Retracted articles (of which
   138 were listed in Web of Science) received a median of 2 citations
   (range 0-148, IQR 5). Conclusion: The number of retracted medical
   imaging publications continues to increase over time, which could
   indicate that more com-promised research has either been published or
   discovered. Scientific misconduct was the main cause for retraction.

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is threefold: (i) to identify the combinations of
   national culture dimensions that lead to high (or low) male or female
   retracted publications, (ii) to understand the role of personal trust as
   a relevant condition that combines with national culture dimensions to
   cause high (or low) male or female retraction, and (iii) to identify the
   differences in the configurations that lead to those outcomes. Based on
   framework of Hofstede's cross-cultural analysis and data from Hofstede
   Center, World Value, and Web of Science, this essay analyzes cultural
   complex causal relations between national culture and trust dimensions
   (conditions), and male and female retracted publications (outcomes) in
   30 countries nationally and globally by fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis. This research provides three major insights: (i)
   Cultural dimensions (power distance, individualism, masculinity,
   uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation) and trust are not
   necessary conditions for both male and female to cause retractions, (ii)
   different levels of personal trust (high/low) combine with national
   cultural dimensions in order to produce different configurations that
   can lead to high or low retractions, and (iii) Each gender causes
   retractions in a similar or identical way, but each also owns its unique
   way. Finally, we provide effective policy recommendations to specific
   countries based on our critical conclusions and discussions.},

Abstract = {The growth of the retraction databases reveals the disturbing trend in
   science and also the rising trend of citations of retracted papers is a
   serious concern. The objective of the study is to investigate the
   patterns of retractions through the team size and retracted citations.
   The publication records of 12,231 retracted papers indexed by Web of
   Science (WoS) are analyzed to investigate (i) the patterns of retraction
   associated with collaboration and team size; and (ii) the impact of
   retracted papers on the papers that are citing the retracted papers
   (retracted citations). The study demonstrates the collaboration patterns
   of retracted publications where 61.5\% of authors have only one and
   24.6\% have two retracted papers; however, 2\% of authors have more than
   retracted papers. Also, the temporal evolution of the team size reveals
   that teams smaller in size have more retractions. The impact of citing
   retracted papers reveals that 55.2\% of retracted papers have been cited
   at least once. 1/4th of the citations to the retracted papers are
   self-citations which themselves are retractions. On average 71.4\%
   citations are the non-retracted citations and 28.6\% citations are
   retracted citations which are mostly the self-citations. Last, the
   variation in average team size and average retracted citations in
   various research areas (having high retraction) is presented. Retracted
   publications in high-impact journals are highly cited.},

Title = {Retracted publications in pharmacy systematic reviews},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-55},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Systematic reviews and other evidence syntheses, the pinnacle
   of the evidence pyramid, embody comprehensiveness and rigor; however,
   retracted data are being incorporated into these publications. This
   study examines the use of retracted publications in the field of
   pharmacy, describes characteristics of retracted publications cited by
   systematic reviews, and discusses factors associated with citation
   likelihood. Methods: Using data from Retraction Watch, we identified
   retracted publications in the pharmacy field. We identified all articles
   citing these retracted publications in Web of Science and Scopus and
   limited results to systematic reviews. We classified the retraction
   reason, determined whether the citation occurred before or after
   retraction, and analyzed factors associated with the likelihood of
   systematic reviews citing a retracted publication. Results: Of 1,396
   retracted publications, 283 were cited 1,096 times in systematic
   reviews. Most (65.0\%) (712/1096) citations occurred before retraction.
   Citations were most often to items retracted due to data falsification
   or manipulation (39.2\%), followed by items retracted due to ethical
   misconduct including plagiarism (30.4\%), or concerns about or errors in
   data or methods (26.2\%). Compared to those not cited in systematic
   reviews, cited items were significantly more likely to be retracted due
   to data falsification and manipulation, were published in high impact
   factor journals, and had longer delays between publication and
   retraction. Conclusions: Further analysis of systematic reviews citing
   retracted publications is needed to determine the impact of flawed data.
   Librarians understand the nuances involved and can advocate for greater
   transparency around the retraction process and increase awareness of
   challenges posed by retractions.},

Title = {The continued citation of retracted publications in dentistry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {108},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-397},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective: Publications are retracted for many reasons, but the
   continued use and citation of retracted publications presents a problem
   for future research. This study investigated retractions in the dental
   literature to understand the characteristics of retracted publications,
   the reasons for their retractions, and the nature and context of their
   citations after retraction.
   Methods: In September 2018, the authors identified retracted dentistry
   publications using the Retraction Watch database. Citations to those
   publications were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science.
   Characteristics of retracted publications and their citations were
   collected, including study design, reasons for retraction, and nature of
   citation (positive, negative, or neutral). We used chi-square tests to
   determine if there were notable differences between retracted
   publications that were cited following retraction and those that were
   not, and if there were relationships between the nature of the citation,
   the study design of the original publication, and its reason for
   retraction.
   Results: Of the 136 retracted publications, 84 were cited after
   retraction. When restricted to English language, 81 retracted
   publications received citations from 685 publications. Only 5.4\% of the
   citations noted the retracted status of the original publication, while
   25.3\% of citations were neutral and 69.3\% were positive. Animal
   studies were more likely to be uncited after retraction, while in vitro
   studies and randomized controlled trials were more likely to be cited.
   Retracted publications that were cited negatively were more likely to
   have been retracted due to scientific distortion than those that were
   cited positively or neutrally. Retracted publications that were cited
   negatively were also more likely to be observational studies than those
   cited positively or neutrally.
   Conclusion: Retracted publications in dentistry are continually cited
   positively following their retraction, regardless of their study designs
   or reasons for retraction. This indicates that the continued citation of
   retracted publications in this field cannot be isolated to certain
   research methods or misconduct but is, instead, a more widespread issue.},

Abstract = {Scientific publications with compromised integrity should be retracted.
   Papers citing retracted publications might need correction if findings
   depend on the retracted publication. While many studies have reported on
   post-retraction citations, few have focused on citations made before the
   retraction. We investigated the citation profile for a research group
   with 113 published concerns regarding publication integrity (CRPI). We
   identified 376 of their source publications that were cited by 5577
   articles, and whether the source publication had a published CRPI. Of
   6926 references to a source publication in these citing articles, for
   3925 (57\%) the source article had a published CRPI, while for 3001
   (43\%) it did not. Of these 3925 references, 3688 were in citing
   articles published before the source article CRPI was published. 166
   citing articles containing 198 references to source publications were
   published after the corresponding source article CRPI was published
   (range 1-5 such references/article; 19/166 (11\%) articles had >1
   reference). In summary, many articles cite retracted publications, with
   the majority of these references occurring before the retraction.
   However, very few publications assess the impact of the retracted
   citations, even though the findings of many might be altered, at least
   in part, by removal of the retracted citation.},

Abstract = {Background: Retracted publications are a crucial, yet overlooked, issue
   in the scientific community. The purpose of our study was to assess the
   prevalence, characteristics, and trends of retracted publications in the
   field of orthopaedics.
   Methods: Five databases were utilized to identify retracted publications
   in orthopaedics. The cited articles were assessed for various
   characteristics, including reason for retraction, based on the Committee
   on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and trends over time.
   Results: From 1984 to June 4, 2016, 59 of 229,502 orthopaedic
   publications were retracted (3 per 10,000 articles). There was a spike
   in the prevalence (22 of 59) of retracted articles in 2015. When
   compared with the total number of retracted publications identified
   through PubMed, the field of orthopaedics represented 1.4\% of all
   retracted publications. The original version of 47 of these 59 retracted
   publications was still available on the respective journal's web site;
   14 (30\%) of these were not noted as having been retracted. The mean
   time fromelectronic publication to retraction was 19.4 +/- 23.3 months.
   The mean number of citations of a retracted publication after the date
   of retraction was 9.3 +/- 19.3. Reasons for retraction included
   plagiarism (32\%), misconduct (27\%), redundant publication (22\%),
   miscalculation or experimental error (8\%), and unethical research
   (0\%); the reason for retraction was not stated for 10\% of the
   publications. There was no correlation between a journal's impact factor
   and the mean number of months to retraction (p = 0.564).
   Conclusions: While uncommon, the retraction of publications within the
   field of orthopaedics may be increasing. The most often cited reasons
   for retraction were plagiarism, misconduct, and redundant publication.
   Retracted articles continue to be cited in the literature after
   retraction.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims: Various aspects of retracted articles authored by
   Yoshitaka Fujii and their retraction notices have been examined. Yuhji
   Saitoh has coauthored many articles with Yoshitaka Fujii which were
   subsequently retracted. Japanese Society of Anesthesiology (JSA)
   recommends retraction of various articles by Yuhji Saitoh, but various
   attributes of those and their retraction notices have not been examined.
   Methods: A list of retracted articles was retrieved from PubMed,
   Retraction Watch Database and relevant journals. Their retraction
   notices were obtained from the journal's webpage. Predefined
   characteristics of the retracted articles and their retraction notices
   were evaluated against those proposed by Committee on Publication Ethics
   (COPE). Results: Fifteen such articles were retracted. Two of them were
   not identified as retracted in the journal webpage. Half of the papers
   mentioned by JSA are yet to be retracted. Among those retracted, only
   13.3\% retraction notices were in line with the guidelines published by
   the COPE. Two retracted articles are yet to be flagged as retracted in
   PubMed. The median (interquartile range) time required for retraction
   from the date of declaration of being eligible for retraction is 14 (3)
   months. Data were analysed with Microsoft Excel (TM) (2007). Conclusion:
   Even after more than 1 year of recommendation, many articles containing
   evidence of scientific misconduct are yet to be retracted. Among those
   retracted, the relevant authority failed to follow the prevalent and
   well-regarded standards of ethics in scholarly publication.},

   scientific community more comprehensively, this paper introduces the
   impact of retracted publications on technology, establishes the
   Multi-Dimensional Observation Framework of Retracted Publications from
   the five aspects, including Scientific impact, Scientists Impact,
   Technology Impact, Funding Impact and Altmetric Impact, and propose the
   use of multi-dimension bubble diagram and sanky diagram to show the
   multi-dimensional data. This paper takes all the retracted publications
   from the journal Cell as an example, using the observation framework to
   analyze them, and describes the impact of these papers from multiple
   dimensions. The results show that compared with the single dimension,
   the observation framework reveals the impact characteristics of
   retracted publications abundantly to some extent, and also expands the
   dimension of retracted publications' impact.},

Title = {An analysis of retractions of dental publications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {19-23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives: To comprehensively report on the characteristics of
   retracted publications in the field of dentistry.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), PubMed Central, Web of
   Science and Google Scholar databases for dental retracted articles from
   database inception to 02 July 2018. In addition, we scanned the search
   engine Google Scholar, and the website, Retraction Watch
   (www.retractionwatch.com), for retracted dental articles. Two
   researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full text of
   search results. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article
   including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and
   time between publication and retraction. Regression models were used to
   evaluate the association between journal impact factor and retraction
   characteristics.
   Results: A total of 138 retractions of dental articles were included.
   Reasons for retraction were misconduct (N = 100, 72.5\%), with the most
   frequently reported misconduct being overlap/plagiarism and
   innacurate/falsified conducting and reporting (N = 53, 38.4\%). In vitro
   (N = 39, 28.3\%), case reports (N = 29, 21\%) and narrative reviews (N =
   19, 13.8\%) were study design most frequently identified in retracted
   articles. The median time between article publication and date of
   retraction notice was 1 year (interquartile-range {[}IQR] = 0-2 years).
   More than half of the retracted articles (n = 82, 59.4\%) were cited
   post-retraction. A retracted article reporting a randomized controlled
   trial was more likely to appear in journal with higher impact factor
   than a retracted case report (mean difference {[}MD] = 2.2; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.2,3.1. Articles retracted after 2012 were
   likely to appear in journals with a lower impact factor (MD = -1.3;
   95\%CI = -1.8, 0.8).
   Conclusions: Research misconduct is the main reason for retraction of
   dental articles. A substantial proportion of these articles were still
   being cited after their retraction.
   Clinical Significance: This report of dental retraction articles informs
   that more transparency is needed with data reporting in dentistry to
   improve writing practices in dentistry. A more complete report of
   retractions and their causes would provide more accurate information to
   inform researchers and editors to avoid or reduce future cases of
   retractions. More complete and accurate reporting would increase the
   overall trust in dental research.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested an increase in the number of retracted
   scientific publications. It is unclear how broadly the issue of
   misleading and fraudulent publications pertains to retractions of drug
   therapy studies. Therefore, we sought to determine the trends and
   factors associated with retracted publications in drug therapy
   literature. A PubMed search was conducted to identify retracted drug
   therapy articles published from 20002011. Articles were grouped
   according to reason for retraction, which was classified as scientific
   misconduct or error. Scientific misconduct was further divided into data
   fabrication, data falsification, questions of data veracity, unethical
   author conduct, and plagiarism. Error was defined as duplicate
   publication, scientific mistake, journal error, or unstated reasons.
   Additional data were extracted from the retracted articles, including
   type of article, funding source, author information, therapeutic area,
   and retraction issue. A total of 742 retractions were identified from
   20002011 in the general biomedical literature, and 102 drug studies met
   our inclusion criteria. Of these, 73 articles (72\%) were retracted for
   a reason classified as scientific misconduct, whereas 29 articles (28\%)
   were retracted for error. Among the 73 articles classified as scientific
   misconduct, those classified as unethical author conduct (32 articles
   {[}44\%]) and data fabrication (24 articles {[}33\%]) constituted the
   majority. The median time from publication of the original article to
   retraction was 31 similar to months (range 1130). Fifty percent of
   retracted articles did not state a funding source, whereas
   pharmaceutical manufacturer funding accounted for only 13 articles
   (13\%) analyzed. Many retractions were due to repeat offenses by a small
   number of authors, with nearly 40\% of the retracted studies associated
   with two individuals. We found that a greater proportion of drug therapy
   articles were retracted for reasons of misconduct and fraud compared
   with other biomedical studies. It is important for health care
   practitioners to monitor the literature for retractions so that
   recommendations for drug therapy and patient management may be modified
   accordingly.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify the characteristics of retracted publications in
   rehabilitation and sport sciences journals.
   Data Sources: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Retraction Watch databases
   were searched from inception to August 2019.
   Study Selection: Retracted publications published in rehabilitation or
   sport sciences journals, indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded
   (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were included.
   Data Extraction: One author extracted the data. Two other authors
   checked the data.
   Data Synthesis: A total of 37 and 52 retracted publications and their
   retraction notices were identified for rehabilitation and sport
   sciences, respectively. The majority of retracted publications (68\% of
   all retracted papers in rehabilitation and 54\% of all retracted papers
   in sport sciences) were published in the past decade. Retracted
   publications in rehabilitation and sport sciences were published in 21
   and 22 different journals and originated from 18 and 21 different
   countries, respectively. The full-text of the retracted publications was
   available with a retraction watermark or note for 59\% of cases in
   rehabilitation and 58\% in sport sciences. The reasons for the
   retractions were more often attributed to misconduct (79\% and 61\%)
   than to honest error (21\% and 39\%) in rehabilitation and sport
   sciences, respectively. However, a reason was not stated for 15\% of the
   publications. The median time interval between publication and
   retraction was 622 days in rehabilitation and 607 days in sport sciences
   publications.
   Conclusions: The total number of retracted publications in
   rehabilitation and sport sciences journals was small. The retracted
   publications have been published in a variety of rehabilitation and
   sport sciences journals and came from different countries across the
   world. Several retracted publications and retraction notices failed to
   adhere to The Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines in the handling
   of full-text (retain with a watermark or note) or stating the underlying
   reasons for the retraction. (C) 2020 by the American Congress of

Abstract = {An increasing problem throughout the world, plagiarism and related
   dishonest behaviors have been affecting Indian science for quite some
   time. To curb this problem, the Indian government has initiated a number
   of measures, such as providing plagiarism detecting software to all the
   universities for free. Still, however, many unfair or incorrect papers
   are published. For some time, publishers have used an efficient tool to
   deal with such situations: retractions. A published paper that is later
   discovered to not deserve publicationwhich can be for a number of
   reasonscan be withdrawn (and often removed from the online contents of
   the journal) by the publisher. This study aims (1) to identify retracted
   publications authored orco-authored by researchers affiliated to Indian
   institutions and (2) to analyze the reasons for the retractions. To meet
   these aims, we searched the SCOPUS database to identify retraction
   notices for articles authored or coauthored by Indian authors. The first
   retraction notice was issued back in 1996, an exceptionally early
   retraction, as the next one was published in 2005. Thus, we analyzed 239
   retractions (195 from journals and 44 from conference proceedings)
   published between 2005 and 3 August 2018 (but most were published after
   2010), in terms of the following qualitative retraction-wise parameters:
   the main reason for retraction, authorship, a collaboration level,
   collaborating countries, sources of retraction (a journal or conference
   proceedings), and funding sources of the research. We also detected
   journals with high retraction frequencies. Mainly two phrasesRetraction
   notice to and Retracted Articlewere used to retract publications. The
   most frequent reason for retractions was plagiarism.},

Title = {Reducing the Inadvertent Spread of Retracted Science: recommendations
   from the RISRS report},
Journal = {RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Background Retraction is a mechanism for alerting readers to unreliable
   material and other problems in the published scientific and scholarly
   record. Retracted publications generally remain visible and searchable,
   but the intention of retraction is to mark them as ``removed{''} from
   the citable record of scholarship. However, in practice, some retracted
   articles continue to be treated by researchers and the public as valid
   content as they are often unaware of the retraction. Research over the
   past decade has identified a number of factors contributing to the
   unintentional spread of retracted research. The goal of the Reducing the
   Inadvertent Spread of Retracted Science: Shaping a Research and
   Implementation Agenda (RISRS) project was to develop an actionable
   agenda for reducing the inadvertent spread of retracted science. This
   included identifying how retraction status could be more thoroughly
   disseminated, and determining what actions are feasible and relevant for
   particular stakeholders who play a role in the distribution of
   knowledge. Methods These recommendations were developed as part of a
   year-long process that included a scoping review of empirical literature
   and successive rounds of stakeholder consultation, culminating in a
   three-part online workshop that brought together a diverse body of 65
   stakeholders in October-November 2020 to engage in collaborative problem
   solving and dialogue. Stakeholders held roles such as publishers,
   editors, researchers, librarians, standards developers, funding program
   officers, and technologists and worked for institutions such as
   universities, governmental agencies, funding organizations, publishing
   houses, libraries, standards organizations, and technology providers.
   Workshop discussions were seeded by materials derived from stakeholder
   interviews (N = 47) and short original discussion pieces contributed by
   stakeholders. The online workshop resulted in a set of recommendations
   to address the complexities of retracted research throughout the
   scholarly communications ecosystem. Results The RISRS recommendations
   are: (1) Develop a systematic cross-industry approach to ensure the
   public availability of consistent, standardized, interoperable, and
   timely information about retractions; (2) Recommend a taxonomy of
   retraction categories/classifications and corresponding retraction
   metadata that can be adopted by all stakeholders; (3) Develop best
   practices for coordinating the retraction process to enable timely,
   fair, unbiased outcomes; and (4) Educate stakeholders about pre- and
   post-publication stewardship, including retraction and correction of the
   scholarly record. Conclusions Our stakeholder engagement study led to 4
   recommendations to address inadvertent citation of retracted research,
   and formation of a working group to develop the Communication of
   Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern (CORREC) Recommended
   Practice. Further work will be needed to determine how well retractions
   are currently documented, how retraction of code and datasets impacts
   related publications, and to identify if retraction metadata (fails to)
   propagate. Outcomes of all this work should lead to ensuring retracted
   papers are never cited without awareness of the retraction, and that, in
   public fora outside of science, retracted papers are not treated as
   valid scientific outputs.},

Abstract = {Both the scientific community and the general public have expressed
   concern over scientific misconduct. The number of retracted articles has
   increased dramatically over the past 20years and now comprises about
   .02\% of the 2 million articles published each year. Retraction of
   publications available in large public databases can be analyzed as an
   objective measure for scientific misconduct and errors. In this project,
   we analyzed retractions of scientific publications using the Web of
   Science (WoS) and PubMed databases. We found that a power law is
   applicable to distributions of retracting authors and retracted
   publications with exponents of about -.6 and -3.0, respectively.
   Application of a power-law model for retracted publications implies that
   retraction is not a random event. Analysis of the retraction
   distributions suggests that a small fraction (1-2\%) of retracting
   authors with 5 retractions are responsible for around 10\% of
   retraction. The probabilities for their repeating retraction are
   calculated using a statistical model: 3-5\% likelihood of repeat
   retraction for authors with a single retraction at five years after the
   latest retraction and 26-37\% for authors with five retractions at five
   years after the latest retraction. By focusing on those with repeated
   retractions, this analysis could contribute to identification of
   measures to reduce such repetition of retractions.},

   Statistics methods such as frequency, mean, interquartile range (IQR),
   and Pearson's Correlation were used for data analysis. The findings
   showed the retracted papers were published in 28 different hematology
   journals. The majority of retracted documents were in Article type (n =
   81). The mean time interval of the retracted papers from the first
   publication to retraction was 50.83 months. The largest number of
   retracted papers belonged to the United States (n = 46). The most
   frequently reported reason for retraction was misconduct (n = 55). The

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize retracted publications
   in emergency medicine. We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all retracted
   publications in the field of emergency medicine. We also searched an
   independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific
   publications. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts
   and full text of search results. Data from all included studies were
   then independently extracted. We identified 28 retraction notes. Eleven
   (39\%) articles were published by authors from Europe. The oldest
   retracted article was published in 2001. The 28 retracted papers were
   published by 22 different journals. Two authors were named on multiples
   retractions. The median impact factor of journals was 1.03 (0.6-1.9).
   Almost all studies were available online {[}26/28 (93\%)], but only 40\%
   had watermarking on the article. The retraction notification was
   available for all articles. Three (11\%) retraction notices did not
   clearly report the retraction reasons, and most retraction notices were
   issued by the editors {[}14 (56\%)]. The most frequent retraction
   reasons were plagiarism {[}eight (29\%)], duplicate publication {[}three
   (11\%)] and overlap {[}two (2\%)]. Retracted articles were cited on
   average 14 times. In most cases, the retraction cause did not invalidate
   the study's results {[}17 (60\%)]. The most common reason for retraction
   was related to a misconduct by the authors. These results can question
   the necessity to normalize retraction procedures among the large number
   of biomedical editors and to educate future researchers on research
   integrity. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights

Journal = {HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 19},
Abstract = {BackgroundAs the prevalence of autism appears to increase, more research
   to guide effective diagnosis and intervention practices is needed.
   Findings disseminated through peer-reviewed publications are critical,
   but the number of retractions continues to rise. An understanding of
   retracted publications is imperative to ensure the body of evidence is
   corrected and current. ObjectivesThe objectives of this analysis were to
   summarize key characteristics of retracted publications in autism
   research, examine the length of time between publication and retraction,
   and assess the extent journals are adhering to publishing ethical
   guidelines for reporting retracted articles. MethodsWe searched five
   databases through 2021 (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and
   Retraction Watch). ResultsA total of 25 retracted articles were included
   in the analysis. Ethical misconduct accounted for the majority of
   retractions rather than scientific error. The shortest time to
   retraction was 2 months and the longest length was 144 months.
   DiscussionThe time lag between publication and retraction since 2018 has
   improved considerably. Nineteen of the articles had retraction notices
   (76\%), whereas six articles did not have a notice (24\%).
   ConclusionThese findings summarize errors of previous retractions and
   illuminate opportunities for researchers, journal publishers and
   librarians to learn from retracted publications.},

Title = {Analysis of Retracted Publications in The Biomedical Literature from
   Turkey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {18},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Background: Retraction is a process for correcting the literature and
   provides a barrier to the dissemination of publications that include
   major faults or false-misleading data. The aim of this study was to
   examine the characteristics of retracted articles in the biomedical
   field sourced from Turkey. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional
   study, all retracted publications from Turkey on PubMed were listed
   without date restriction. Data covering the article title, authors,
   publication date, retraction date, time between publication and
   retraction dates (in months), journal, article type, country of the
   corresponding author, peer review timeline (in days), reason for
   retraction, and subject area of the retracted item were recorded.
   Citation data were obtained using the Scopus database. The altmetric
   attention scores of the articles were recorded. Results: A total of 102
   articles were listed and after the implementation of exclusion criteria,
   86 articles were included for analysis. The first retracted article was
   published in 2000 (n = 1), while the most retracted articles were
   published in 2020 (n = 11). The median time lag between publication and
   retraction was 10.33 (0.73-144.06) months. The main factors causing
   retraction were plagiarism (n = 23), duplication (n = 22) and error (n =
   17). The total number of citations was 695. A total of 224 citations
   were in the pre-retraction period and 471 citations were in the
   post-retraction period. Conclusion: The retracted article counts showed
   a rising trend over the years. The leading causes of retraction for
   articles from Turkey were plagiarism, duplication, and error. It was
   found that the articles continued to be cited after the retraction.
   Researchers in Turkey should be educated on retraction, particularly
   plagiarism and duplication. Strategies should be developed to prevent
   articles from being cited after retraction.},

Abstract = {We investigated reasons for retraction, pre-and post-retraction
   citations and Altmetrics indicators of retracted publications in the
   medical sciences from 2016 to 2020. Data were retrieved from Scopus (n =
   840). The Retraction Watch database was used to identify the reasons for
   retraction and the time that elapsed from publication to retraction. The
   findings showed that intentional errors were the most prevalent reasons
   for retraction. China (438), the United States (130), and India (51)
   have the largest share of retractions. These retracted publications were
   cited 5,659 times in other research publications, of which 1,559
   citations occurred after the retraction, which should raise concern.
   These retracted papers were also shared in online platforms, mainly on
   Twitter and by members of the general public. We recommend that the
   early detection of retracted papers may help to reduce the rate of
   citation and sharing of these publications, and minimize their negative
   impact.},

Abstract = {Context: Fraudulent publication is a scourge of scientific research.
   Objectives: This scoping review was aimed at characterizing retracted
   publications for fraud or plagiarism in the field of anesthesia. Does
   the reputation of the journal (Quartile and Impact Factor, IF) protect
   the reader from the risk of having the manuscript he read withdrawn for
   fraud/plagiarism?
   Methods/Design: This scoping review was planned following the Joanna
   Briggs Institute recommendations. Data sources: PubMed and the
   Retraction Watch Database
   (http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?).
   Study selection: All types of publications retracted. Data extraction:
   Year, first author nationality, journal name, journal category, IF,
   Quartile, H index.
   Data analysis: The association with Quartile and IF was investigated.
   Results: No significant association between retraction of papers
   published in no-Quartile journals and retractions published in journals
   placed in the highest quartile.
   Conclusions: The quality of the surveillance in paper submission is not
   higher in journals of the first Quartile than in journals not placed in
   other Quartiles. (The protocol was prospectively registered in the Open
   Science Framework https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TGKNE)},

Abstract = {Among the many forms of research misconduct, publishing fraudulent data
   is considered to be serious where the confidence and validity of the
   research is detrimentally undermined. In this study, the trend of 303
   retracted publications from 44 authors (with more than three retracted
   publications each) was analysed. The results showed that only 6.60\% of
   the retracted publications were single-authored and the discovery of
   fraudulent publications had reduced from 52.24 months (those published
   before the year 2000) to 33.23 months (those published on the year 2000
   and onwards). It appears that with the widely accessible public
   databases like PubMed, fraudulent publications can be detected more
   easily. The different approaches adopted by authors who had previous
   publications retracted are also discussed herein.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the biomedical journal characteristics that are
   associated with the retraction of papers.
   Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. All papers
   retracted and indexed in PubMed from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st,
   2016 were included. We used nine main categories to classify
   retractions: aspects related with data, authors issues, plagiarism,
   unethical research, journal issues, review process, conflict of
   interest, other, and unknown. These categories were further classified
   as: misconduct, suspicion of misconduct, or no misconduct.
   Results: The proportion of retraction was 2.5 per 10,000 publications.
   Retractions appeared in 611 journals. During the study period,
   retraction due to misconduct was more frequent among journals with
   low-impact factor. Within these retracted publications, among low-impact
   journals the presence of misconduct was higher with a 73\% compared to
   61\% for the high-impact journals (p=0.001). There were differences in
   the percentage of retractions due to misconduct regarding the journal
   classification category (p <0.001).
   Conclusions: Retraction of publications is present in both high- and
   low-impact factor biomedical journals, but misconduct is more frequent
   among the papers retracted from lower impact journals. Measures before
   and after publication should be taken to limit misconduct. (C) 2019

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine how many papers have been
   retracted or withdrawn, and for what reason, in journals relating to
   plastic surgery.
   PubMed and SCOPUS were used, with the search terms (retracted OR
   withdrawn) AND (article OR publication OR paper) AND \{(plastic surgery)
   OR (cosmetic surgery) OR (maxillofacial surgery) OR (craniofacial
   surgery)\}. The papers were analyzed and classified according to the
   reason for retraction or withdrawal, journal name, publication year, and
   author. In the PubMed and SCOPUS, 227 and 114 titles were found,
   respectively, from which 34 duplicate titles were removed. An additional
   261 titles which did not include ``retracted'' or ``withdrawn'' were
   removed, leaving 46 papers and 6 mined papers were added. The 52 full
   texts (42 ``retracted'' and 10 ``withdrawn'') were analyzed.
   The most frequent reason for retraction or withdrawal was duplication
   (17, 32.7\%) followed by the author's request (9, 17.3\%), plagiarism
   (7, 13.5\%), and lack of permission (5, 9.6\%). Retraction was most
   common in Plast Reconstr Surg (6, 12\%) followed by Aesthetic Plast Surg
   (4, 7.9\%), Ann Plast Surg (2, 3.9\%), J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg (2,
   3.9\%), and Surg Res (2, 3.9\%). Most authors retracted a paper just
   once; however, 6 authors retracted a paper twice or more. The first
   retraction was found in 1991, and the number of retractions showed a
   tendency to increase over time. However, the duplication rate did not
   change over time (R-2 = 0.178, P = 0.117).
   Journal reviewers, as well as production editors, should check for
   duplication, plagiarism, or permission-related problems.},

Abstract = {Problematic publications and scientific misconduct have raised global
   concern, in which the authors have played a key role. Since research
   misconduct occurs more frequently in the clinical medicine field, we
   took this field as an example to explore productivity patterns,
   collaboration, and scientific careers of authors at the individual
   level. The application of Lotka's law (C = 0.883, n = 3.597) showed a
   loose collaboration network and a predominant aggregation of authors
   with multiple retracted publications. Most authors were retracted only
   once while a small group of authors had most retracted publications.
   Authors with most retractions appeared to have stable collaboration with
   certain individuals. The occurrences of falsification and ethical issues
   increased with the higher involvement of authors with multiple retracted
   publications. Two typical publication patterns of retractions in
   different stages of scientific career have been found: (1) committing
   scientific misconduct in the early career, mainly for promotion, and (2)
   participating in scientific misconduct when mature in the career, most
   due to neglecting the duty as a supervisor. The team culture,
   regulations, publication policies, and joint efforts by the scientific
   community have a direct influence on the occurrences of scientific
   misconduct. Conclusions are made with a focus on the need for more
   actions to prevent scientific misconduct and to strengthen scientific
   norms and integrity.},

Abstract = {The number of retracted scientific articles has been increasing. Most
   retractions are associated with research misconduct, entailing financial
   costs to funding sources and damage to the careers of those committing
   misconduct. We sought to calculate the magnitude of these effects. Data
   relating to retracted manuscripts and authors found by the Office of
   Research Integrity (ORI) to have committed misconduct were reviewed from
   public databases. Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and
   publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed
   misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to
   misconduct accounted for approximately \$58 million in direct funding by
   the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1\% of the NIH budget over this
   period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of \$392,582 in
   direct costs (SD \$423,256). Researchers experienced a median 91.8\%
   decrease in publication output and large declines in funding after
   censure by the ORI.},

   or suspected fraud (43.4\%), duplicate publication (14.2\%), and
   plagiarism (9.8\%). Incomplete, uninformative or misleading retraction
   announcements have led to a previous underestimation of the role of
   fraud in the ongoing retraction epidemic. The percentage of scientific

Title = {Lack of involvement of medical writers and the pharmaceutical industry
   in publications retracted for misconduct: a systematic, controlled,
   retrospective study},
Journal = {CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1175-1182},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives:
   The primary objective of this study was to quantify how many
   publications retracted because of misconduct involved declared medical
   writers (i.e., not ghostwriters) or declared pharmaceutical industry
   support. The secondary objective was to investigate factors associated
   with misconduct retractions.
   Design:
   A systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study.
   Data source:
   Retracted publications dataset in the MEDLINE database.
   Data selection:
   PubMed was searched (Limits: English, human, January 1966 - February
   2008) to identify publications retracted because of misconduct.
   Publications retracted because of mistake served as the control group.
   Standardized definitions and data collection tools were used, and data
   were analyzed by an independent academic statistician.
   Results:
   Of the 463 retracted publications retrieved, 213 (46\%) were retracted
   because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of misconduct
   rarely involved declared medical writers (3/213; 1.4\%) or declared
   pharmaceutical industry support (8/213; 3.8\%); no misconduct
   retractions involved both declared medical writers and the industry.
   Retraction because of misconduct, rather than mistake, was significantly
   associated with: absence of declared medical writers (odds ratio: 0.16;
   95\% confidence interval: 0.05-0.57); absence of declared industry
   involvement (0.25; 0.11-0.58); single authorship (2.04; 1.01-4.12);
   first author having at least one other retraction (2.05; 1.35-3.11); and
   first author affiliated with a low/middle income country (2.34;
   1.18-4.63). The main limitations of this study were restricting the
   search to English-language and human research articles.
   Conclusions:
   Publications retracted because of misconduct rarely involved declared
   medical writers or declared pharmaceutical industry support. Increased
   attention should focus on factors that are associated with misconduct
   retractions.},

Title = {Misconduct as the main cause for retraction. A descriptive study of
   retracted publications and their authors},
Journal = {GACETA SANITARIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {356-360},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: To analyze the causes of retracted publications and the main
   characteristics of their authors.
   Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed including all
   retracted publications from January 1st, 2013-December 31st, 2016
   indexed in PubMed. The causes of retraction were classified as: data
   management, authorship issues, plagiarism, unethical research, journal
   issues, review process, conflict 01 interest, other causes, and unknown
   reasons. Then, misbehaviour was classified as misconduct, suspicion of
   misconduct or no misconduct suspicion.
   Results: 1,082 retracted publications were identified. The retraction
   rate for the period was 2.5 per 10,000 publications. The main cause of
   retraction was misconduct (65.3\%), and the leading reasons were
   plagiarism, data management and compromise of the review process. The
   highest proportion of retracted publications corresponded to Iran (15.52
   per 10,000), followed by Egypt and China (11.75 and 8.26 pet 10,000).
   Conclusions: Currently, misconduct is the main cause of retraction.
   Specific strategies to limit this phenomenon must be implemented. It
   would be useful to standardize reasons and procedures for retraction.
   The development of a standard retraction form to be permanently indexed
   in a database might be relevant. (C) 2018 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to explore trends in retracted publications in
   life sciences and biomedical sciences over axes like time, countries,
   journals and impact factors, and topics. Nearly seven thousand
   publications, which comprise the entirety of retractions visible through
   PubMed as of August 2019, were used. This work involved sophisticated
   data collection and analysis techniques to use data from PubMed,
   Wikipedia, and WikiData, and study it with respect to the above
   mentioned axes. Importantly, I employ state-of-the-art analysis and
   visualization techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to
   understand the topics in retracted literature. To highlight a few
   results, the analyses demonstrate an increasing rate of retraction over
   time and noticeable differences in the publication quality (as measured
   by journal impact factor) among top countries. Moreover, while molecular
   biology and cancer dominate retractions, we also see a number of
   retractions not related to biology. The methods and results of this
   study can be applied to continuously understand the nature and evolution
   of retractions in life sciences, thus contributing to the health of this
   research ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Problematic publications and scientific misconduct have raised global
   concern, in which the authors have played a key role. Since research
   misconduct occurs more frequently in the clinical medicine field, we
   took this field as an example to explore productivity patterns,
   collaboration and scientific careers of authors at the individual level.
   The application of Lotka's law (C=0.886, n=3.854) showed a loose
   collaboration network and a predominant aggregation of multi-retracted
   authors. Most authors were retracted only once while a small group of
   authors produced most retracted publications. Authors with most
   retractions appeared to have stable collaboration with certain
   individuals. Two typical publication patterns of retractions in
   different stages of scientific career have been found: (1) committing
   scientific misconduct in the early career, mainly for promotion, and (2)
   participating in scientific misconduct when mature in the career, most
   due to neglecting the duty as a supervisor. The team culture,
   regulations, publication policies, and joint efforts by the scientific
   community have a direct influence on the occurrences of scientific
   misconduct. Conclusions are made with a focus on the need for more
   actions to prevent scientific misconduct and to strengthen scientific
   norms and integrity.},

Abstract = {Retraction of scientific publications can unmask scientific misconduct.
   We undertook a survey of publication rates, for authors with multiple
   retractions in the biomedical literature, to determine whether they
   changed after authors' first retractions. We collected publication and
   citation data from Scopus for 100 authors with multiple retractions
   (either >10 retractions or 2-5 retractions) in the Retraction Watch
   database. Publication rates increased until the year of the first
   retraction and decreased rapidly thereafter. By 4 years after the first
   retraction, the proportion of authors actively publishing at least one
   paper/year was <50\%, annual publication rates were <50\% of the
   pre-retraction rate, and only 22\% of authors had a publication rate
   >50\% of their pre-retraction rate. There was no difference in the
   decline in publication rates between authors associated with a
   retraction for misconduct and those not associated with such a
   retraction. After the first retraction, citation rates of retracted
   papers declined whereas those of unretracted papers by the same authors
   remained unchanged. In summary, publication rates of authors with
   multiple retractions, most of whom were associated with scientific
   misconduct, declined rapidly after their first retraction but a small

Title = {Characteristics of global retractions of schizophrenia-related
   publications: A bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {ObjectivesThe growing rate of retraction of scientific publications has
   attracted much attention within the academic community, but there is
   little knowledge about the nature of such retractions in
   schizophrenia-related research. This study aimed to analyze the
   characteristics of retractions of schizophrenia-related publications.
   Materials and methodsThe Web of Science was searched for eligible
   studies. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to describe the
   characteristics of the retractions using R software and Excel 2019.
   Content analysis was conducted to examine the essential components of
   retraction notices. ResultsA total of 36 retracted publications with 415
   citations were identified from 1997 to 2021, of which, 83.3\% occurred
   in the last decade. The overall retraction rate was 0.19\%, with most of
   them (29; 80.56\%) from the United Kingdom. The retractions were
   published in 33 journals, and the 2020 IFs ranged between 0.17 and 49.96
   (Median = 3.93). The retractions involved 21 research areas,
   particularly in Psychiatry (19; 52.78\%), Neurosciences and Neurology
   (10; 27.78\%), and Psychology (7; 19.44\%). Data issues (17; 42.22\%),
   administrative errors of the publishers (5; 13.89\%), and study design
   (4; 11.11\%) were the top three reasons for retractions. ConclusionThis
   study provides an insight into retractions of schizophrenia-related
   publications. Institutional governance should be further strengthened to
   improve the scrutiny of publications, prevent continuing citations, and
   erroneous propagation after retraction.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether negative citations in articles and
   comments posted on post-publication peer review platforms are both
   equally contributing to the correction of science. These 2 types of
   written evidence of disputes are compared by analyzing their occurrence
   in relation to articles that have already been retracted or corrected.
   We identified retracted or corrected articles in a corpus of 72,069
   articles coming from the Engineering field, from 3 journals (Science,
   Tumor Biology, Cancer Research) and from 3 authors with many retractions
   to their credit (Sarkar, Schon, Voinnet). We used Scite to retrieve
   contradicting citations and PubPeer to retrieve the number of comments
   for each article, and then we considered them as traces left by
   scientists to contest published results. Our study shows that
   contradicting citations are very uncommon and that retracted or
   corrected articles are not more contradicted in scholarly articles than
   those that are neither retracted nor corrected but they do generate more
   comments on Pubpeer, presumably because of the possibility for
   contributors to remain anonymous. Moreover, post-publication peer review
   platforms, although external to the scientific publication process
   contribute more to the correction of science than negative citations.
   Consequently, post-publication peer review venues, and more specifically
   the comments found on it, although not contributing to the scientific
   literature, are a mechanism for correcting science. Lastly, we
   introduced the idea of strengthening the role of contradicting citations
   to rehabilitate the clear expression of judgment in scientific papers.},

Title = {Comprehensive Analysis of Retracted Publications in Dentistry: A 23-Year
   Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Background. In the modern tech-savvy era, scientific literature
   publication remains the optimal way to disperse knowledge, even if it
   has transformed from print to mostly electronic. With the new and
   improved publication methods, also come more scrutiny and analytic
   criticism of the scientific work. It becomes even more important in this
   context to rectify flawed scientific work responsibly. This present
   study was undertaken to help clarify the process and causes of
   retractions occurring in the dental community and analyse its reasons.
   Methodology. A total of 8092 PubMed indexed articles were scanned from
   the online libraries, and individually scanning for author details,
   place of study, subspecialty of research, funding, dates of original
   publication, and retraction notices issued along with journal specifics
   such as type and impact factors, country of publishing was compiled and
   analysed by two authors. The dataset was then collaboratively analysed
   using Panda's Library in Python software as an analysis tool for data
   preparation and for frequency analysis. The estimates were presented as
   mean differences (MD) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Results.
   The present study had a compiled dataset of 198 articles after screening
   and revealed that maximum retractions of dentistry-related research
   originated from India (25.3\%) and, on average, took 2.6 years to be
   issued a retraction notice. We also deciphered that the USA retracted
   maximum dental articles (34.8\%), and plagiarism was cited as the most
   common (38.02\%) reason for doing so. The present study also brought to
   light that there was a trend for lower impact factor-dental journals in
   retracting maximum articles, most of which were nonfunded (62.16\%). The
   results signify that 63.78\% of all retracted papers continued to be
   cited postretractions. Conclusions. The retractions happening in the
   field of dental literature are currently too time-consuming and often
   unclear to the readers. The authors would like to conclude that the
   retracted papers were mostly from India and Spain mostly related to
   endodontics or prosthodontic research. All of this warrants the need for
   better scrutiny and reforms in the area.},

Abstract = {In 2009, Scott S. Reuben was convicted of fabricating data, which lead
   to 25 of his publications being retracted. Although it is clear that the
   perpetuation of retracted articles negatively effects the appraisal of
   evidence, the extent to which retracted literature is cited had not
   previously been investigated. In this study, to better understand the
   perpetuation of discredited research, we examine the number of citations
   of Reuben's articles within 5 years of their retraction. Citations of
   Reuben's retracted articles were assessed using the Web of Science Core
   Collection (Thomson Reuters, NY). All citing articles were screened to
   discriminate between articles in which Reuben's work was quoted as
   retracted, and articles in which his data was wrongly cited without any
   note of the retraction status. Twenty of Reuben's publications had been
   cited 274 times between 2009 and 1024. In 2014, 45 \% of the retracted
   articles had been cited at least once. In only 25.8 \% of citing
   articles was it clearly stated that Reuben's work had been retracted.
   Annual citations decreased from 108 in 2009 to 18 in 2014; however, the
   percentage of publications correctly indicating the retraction status
   also declined. The percentage of citations in top-25 \%-journals, as
   well as the percentage of citations in journals from Reuben's research
   area, declined sharply after 2009. Our data show that even 5 years after
   their retraction, nearly half of Reuben's articles are still being
   quoted and the retraction status is correctly mentioned in only one
   quarter of the citations.},

Abstract = {Background: Retracted articles represent research withdrawn from the
   existing body of literature after publication. Research articles may be
   retracted for several reasons ranging from honest errors to intentional
   misconduct. They should not be used as reliable sources, and it is
   unclear why they are cited occasionally by other articles. This study
   hypothesized that several mechanisms may contribute to citing retracted
   literature and aimed to analyze the characteristics of articles citing
   retracted literature in anesthesiology and critical care.
   Methods: Using the Retraction Watch database, we retrieved retracted
   articles on anesthesiology and intensive care medicine up to August 16,
   2021, and identified the papers citing these retracted articles. A
   survey designed to investigate the reasons for citing these articles was
   sent to the corresponding authors of the citing papers.
   Results: We identified 478 retracted articles, 220 (46\%) of which were
   cited at least once. We contacted 1297 corresponding authors of the
   papers that cited these articles, 417 (30\%) of whom responded to our
   survey and were included in the final analysis. The median number of
   authors in the analyzed articles was five, and the median elapsed time
   from retraction to citation was 3 yr. Most of the corresponding authors
   (372, 89\%) were unaware of the retracted status of the cited article,
   mainly because of inadequate notification of the retraction status in
   journals and/or databases and the use of stored copies.
   Conclusions: The corresponding authors were generally unaware of the
   retraction of the cited article, usually because of inadequate
   identification of the retracted status in journals and/or web databases
   and the use of stored copies. Awareness of this phenomenon and rigorous
   control of the cited references before submitting a paper are of
   fundamental importance in research.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the publishing of a quantity of
   scientific research. In less than a year, a record of 200,000 scientific
   articles have been published on COVID-19. Publishing such a massive
   quantity of scientific research has instigated publishers to accelerate
   the review process. An upsurge in the publication rate has resulted in
   an increase in the retraction rate. This paper focuses on the COVID-19
   studies originating across the world from 1 January 2020 to 10 October
   2021. The data for this study were mined from
   http://retractiondatabase.org/. A total of 157 withdrawn articles on
   COVID-19 were retracted, and it was found that the United States of
   America contributed 31 (19.75\%) retracted articles. Also, 16 (51.61\%)
   of the retracted papers from the United States of America emerge in
   journals having an Impact Factor (IF). The study presents that 31
   (19.75\%) retracted articles were worked together by two authors, 26
   (16.56\%) with one author, and 22 (14.01\%) by five authors.
   Furthermore, Elsevier publishers have the highest retraction rate with
   80 (50.96\%). Half (50\%) of the articles were retracted with ``no
   information{''} as a reason for retraction. Other reasons for retraction
   include concern/issues about data, duplication, journal error, lack of
   approval from a third party, plagiarism, etc.},

Abstract = {In 2005 the scientific misconduct case of a noted researcher concluded
   with, among other things, the retraction of 10 papers. However, these
   articles continue to be cited at relatively high rates. The objectives
   of this paper are: 1) to track the retraction process of these papers.
   2) to assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citation rates of
   these papers, and 3) to compare the citation history of these retracted
   articles and five other high-profile retraction cases. For objective 1.
   all five articles to be retracted were retracted and of the four to be
   corrected, two were retracted and two were corrected. Eight PubMed and
   journal sites were identified where retraction messages could be
   conveyed; the number of retraction messages averaged 3.4 +/- 2.5 for
   these nine articles. For objective 2, an absolute ``cleansing{''} did
   not occur. While it initially appears there was a relative
   ``cleansing,{''} as citation rates for these articles did decrease after
   retraction, the reductions in citation rates for these articles (-28\%)
   were the same as those for matched nonretracted publications both by the
   same author (-28\%) and by another investigator (-29\%) over the same
   time frame. Relative to objective 3, the results for this case are quite
   different from the five other cases assessing this issue, perhaps
   because of this investigator's ``citation inertia{''} as a result of the
   small percentage of his papers that were retracted and the large number
   of citations to the articles before their retraction and to all of his
   published articles.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The scientific misconduct and fraud case of a noted
   exercise physiology researcher was concluded similar to 15 yr ago, and
   one the of the results was the retraction of 10 published manuscripts.
   However, based on a number of comparisons to that same author's and
   another investigator's citation histories for similar articles, the
   citation histories for these retracted articles appear to not have been
   affected whatsoever in the subsequent 15 yr.},

Abstract = {Background: In 2019, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) authored by Dr.
   Ismail was retracted due to concerns about data integrity. Since there
   are no policies in place to investigate other publications of authors of
   retracted studies, we investigated Dr. Ismail's other trials.
   Methods: We searched for RCTs authored by Dr. Ismail. We made pairwise
   comparisons of values in baseline and outcome tables between trials. We
   assessed whether the distributions of baseline characteristics were
   compatible with properly conducted randomization, using Monte Carlo
   simulations and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We read the publications
   carefully for unusual features.
   Results: Dr. Ismail was author in eight published and one unpublished
   trial. In three of his first author studies we found multiple identical
   values in the baseline and/or outcome tables from different trials. At
   least some of the trials were unlikely to have followed a proper
   randomization process. There were a number of other unusual features in
   the papers we reviewed.
   Conclusions: It is probable that other trials published by Dr. Ismail
   contain questionable data. We call for a thorough investigation of the
   original trial data and related official documents. Our exercise
   suggests that the practice to assess research integrity should include
   all publications of authors with retracted fabricated articles. (C) 2021

Abstract = {Objective To determine the number of retracted articles and to examine
   the reasons for retraction within the obstetrics and gynaecology
   literature. Design Retrospective review of the PubMed database. Setting
   N/A. Population Obstetrics and gynaecology articles published from
   indexation until June 2018. Methods Articles were identified using
   keywords for retracted articles in obstetrics and gynaecology.
   Descriptive statistics were performed. Main outcome measures Incidence
   of article retraction, the reasons given for retraction, and article
   demographics. Results A total of 176 articles were identified with a
   median time to retraction of 2 years; over three-quarters were retracted
   within the last decade (n = 136; 77.3\%). The median journal impact
   factor was 2.5 (range of 0.26-52.67). Subspecialties with the highest
   number of retractions were gynaecological oncology (n = 76; 43.2\%),
   gynaecology (n = 36; 20.5\%), and obstetrics (n = 31; 17.6\%). Among 176
   first authors, 18 authors (10.2\%) had two or more retracted articles.
   Clinical research articles accounted for approximately one-half of the
   retracted articles (n = 87; 49.4\%). Among the clinical studies, 10.2\%
   (n = 18) were randomised control trials, 16.5\% (n = 29) were
   prospective trials and 13.1\% (n = 23) were retrospective studies.
   Plagiarism (n = 40; 22.7\%) and data falsification (n = 37; 21.0\%) were
   the most common reasons given for retraction. Conclusion Article
   retraction within the obstetrics and gynaecology literature is
   increasing. The most frequently cited reasons for article retractions
   were plagiarism, errors in data, fabricated results, article
   duplication, and compromised peer review. Consequences of article
   retractions to patient care and the scientific community can be
   significant. The thorough screening of manuscripts prior to publication
   should be prioritised. Tweetable abstract The rate of retraction in
   obstetrics and gynaecology is increasing; the most common reason for
   retraction is plagiarism.},

Title = {Expert-recommended biomedical journal articles: Their retractions or
   corrections, and post-retraction citing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 2},
Abstract = {Faculty Opinions has provided recommendations of important biomedical
   publications by domain experts (FMs) since 2001. The purpose of this
   study is two-fold: (1) identify the characteristics of the
   expert-recommended articles that were subsequently retracted and (2)
   investigate what happened after retraction. We examined a set of 232
   recommended, later retracted or corrected articles. These articles were
   classified as New Finding (43\%), Interesting Hypothesis (16\%), and so
   on. More than 71\% of the articles acknowledged funding support; the
   National Institutes of Health, USA (NIH) was a top funder (64\%). The
   top reasons for retractions were Errors of various types (28\%);
   Falsification/fabrication of data, image, or results (20\%); Unreliable
   data, image, or results (16\%); and Results not reproducible (16\%).
   Retractions took from less than 2 months to more than 15 years. Only
   15\% of recommendations were withdrawn either after dissents were made
   by other FMs or after retractions. Most of the retracted articles
   continue to be cited post-retraction, especially those published in
   Nature, Science, and Cell. Significant positive correlations were
   observed between post-retraction citations and pre-retraction citations,
   between post-retraction citations and peak citations, and between
   post-retraction citations and the post-retraction citing span. A
   significant negative correlation was also observed between the
   post-retraction citing span and years taken to reach peak citations.
   Literature recommendation systems need to update the changing status of
   the recommended articles in a timely manner; invite the recommending
   experts to update their recommendations; and provide a personalised
   mechanism to alert users who have accessed the recommended articles on
   their subsequent retractions, concerns, or corrections.},

Abstract = {The continued citation of retracted publications from the medical
   literature is a well-known and persistent problem. We describe the
   contexts of ongoing citations to manuscripts that have been retracted
   from a selection of anesthesiology journals. We also examine how
   bibliographic databases and publisher websites document the retracted
   status of these manuscripts. The authors performed an analysis of
   retracted publications from anesthesiology journals using the Retraction
   Watch database. We then examined how the retraction information was
   displayed on bibliographic databases, search engines, and publisher
   websites. The primary outcome was the context of continued citation
   after retraction of flawed publications within the specialty of
   anesthesiology. Secondary outcomes included comparison of the
   documentation, bibliographic databases, search engines, and publisher
   websites used in identifying the retracted status of these publications
   and provision of access to the respective retraction notices. A total of
   245 original publications were retracted over a 28-year period from 9
   anesthesiology journals. PubMed, compared to the other databases and
   search engines, was the most consistent (98.8\%) in documenting the
   retracted status of the publications examined, as well as providing a
   direct link to the retraction notice. From the 211 publications
   retracted before January 2020, there were 1307 postretraction citations
   accessed from Scopus. The median number of postretraction citations was
   3.5 (range, 0-88, with at least 1 citation in 164 publications) in
   Scopus. Of the postretraction citations, 80\% affirmed the validity of
   the retracted publications, while only 5.2\% of citations acknowledged
   the retraction or misconduct. In 10.2\% of the citations from original
   research studies, retracted manuscripts appeared to influence the
   decision to pursue or the methods used in subsequent original research
   studies. The frequency of citation of the 15 most cited retracted
   publications declined in a similar pattern during the 10 years after
   retraction. Citation of manuscripts retracted from anesthesiology
   journals remains a common occurrence. Technological innovations and
   application of standards for handling retracted publications, as
   suggested by coalitions of researchers across the spectrum of scientific
   investigation, may serve to reduce the persistence of this error.},

Title = {Reducing the residue of retractions in evidence synthesis: ways to
   minimise inappropriate citation and use of retracted data},
Journal = {BMJ EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 18},
Abstract = {The incorporation of publications that have been retracted is a risk in
   reliable evidence synthesis. Retraction is an important mechanism for
   correcting the literature and protecting its integrity. Within the
   medical literature, the continued citation of retracted publications
   occurs for a variety of reasons. Recent evidence suggests that
   systematic reviews and meta-analyses often unwittingly cite retracted
   publications which, at least in some cases, may significantly impact
   quantitative effect estimates in meta-analyses. There is strong evidence
   that authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses may be unaware of
   the retracted status of publications and treat them as if they are not
   retracted. These problems are difficult to address for several reasons:
   identifying retracted publications is important but logistically
   challenging; publications may be retracted while a review is in
   preparation or in press and problems with a publication may also be
   discovered after the evidence synthesis is published. We propose a set
   of concrete actions that stakeholders (eg, scientists, peer-reviewers,
   journal editors) might take in the near-term, and that research funders,
   citation management systems, and databases and search engines might take
   in the longer term to limit the impact of retracted primary studies on
   evidence syntheses.},

Abstract = {Retracted publications are a crucial, yet overlooked, issue in the
   scientific community. The purpose of this study was to analyze the
   prevalence, characteristics and reasons of Malaysian retracted papers.
   The Web of Science and Scopus databases were queried to identify
   Malaysian retracted publications. Available versions of original
   articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites.
   The publications were assessed for various characteristics, including
   reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics
   guidelines, and the authority calling for the retractions. From 2009 to
   June 2017, 125 Malaysian publications comprising (33 journal articles
   and 92 conference papers) were retracted. There was a spike in the
   prevalence of retracted articles in 2010 and 2012 with 42 articles
   (33.6\%) and 41 articles (32.8\%) respectively from the 125 retracted
   articles. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 1
   year. There is no significant relationship between a journal quartile
   and the mean number of months to retraction (P = 0.842). The reason for
   retraction for conference papers was specified as ``violation of
   publication principle{''}. Journal articles were retracted mainly for
   duplicate publication, plagiarism, compromised peer review process, and
   self-plagiarism. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and
   only 2 retracted articles have been accused of scientific mistakes. The
   study concludes that retractions were mostly due to the authors
   misconduct. Despite the increases, the proportion of published scholarly
   literature affected by retraction remains very small, indicating that
   retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially increasing and
   incipient, issue within Malaysian papers, which publishers as well as
   editors may have consistently and sufficiently addressed.},

Title = {Why Has the Number of Scientific Retractions Increased?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Background: The number of retracted scientific publications has risen
   sharply, but it is unclear whether this reflects an increase in
   publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which
   flawed articles are withdrawn.
   Methods and Findings: We examined the interval between publication and
   retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed.
   Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of
   retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles
   published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among
   1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82
   months (p<0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers
   more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring
   retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that
   time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful
   scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor
   (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals,
   but only similar to 1\% of the variance in time-to-retraction was
   explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for
   plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication
   in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited
   in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple
   retractions was greater in 1972-1992 than in the current era (p<0.001).
   From 1972-1992, 46.0\% of retracted papers were written by authors with
   a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1\% of retracted papers were
   written by single-retraction authors (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect
   changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers
   to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and
   proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower
   barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for
   ``new{''} offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the
   time-to-retraction of flawed work.},

Title = {Bibliometric Examination of Retracted Articles and Journals in Which
   They Were Published},
Journal = {TURKISH LIBRARIANSHIP},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-27},
Abstract = {Objective: The most important mechanism applied to flawed studies to
   protect the integrity of science is the retraction of articles. The
   increase in the number of articles which have been retracted for various
   reasons is remarkable. Therefore, it is aimed to discover the parameters
   in these articles that harm scientific knowledge. Method: In the
   research, the first 100 journals with the highest number of retracted
   articles in Web of Science (WoS) were selected. Between 1978 and 2020,
   1934 articles were retracted from the selected journals. This study
   sought to answer the questions: 1. In which years has the highest number
   of retracted articles been? 2. Which journal quartiles have the highest
   number of retracted articles? 3. What is the distribution of topics in
   retracted articles? 4. Which countries have more retracted articles? 5.
   What is the time difference between the year in which articles are
   published and retracted? Results: According to the review result, the
   rate of retracted articles has increased over the years. The articles
   were retracted one year after publication have a percentage of 19.5\%.
   The number of retracted articles was in Q1-quartile journals is the
   highest. In the subject distribution of these retracted articles,
   ``Oncology{''} (17.2\%) and ``Biochemistry and Molecular Biology{''}
   (16.9\%) were prominent. The citation rate for retracted articles
   published in the journal Nature, Science and Journal of Biological
   Chemistry is 9\%. The United States (USA), which ranked first in the
   country rankings of the retracted articles, receives the most citations
   with 54\%. Originality: In the literature, it is found that there are
   limited number of Turkey originated publications about the topic. In
   this direction, existing state and changes of the retracted articles
   were examined. Conclusion: Retracted articles that violate science
   ethics have enabled all participants in the scientific communication
   system to be evaluated from different points of view. The results of
   these publications, which were examined within the framework of various
   variables, showed that more publications on the subject should be made
   and solutions should be developed.},

Abstract = {Retracted clinical trials may be influential in citing systematic
   reviews and clinical guidelines. We assessed the influence of 27
   retracted trials on systematic reviews and clinical guidelines (citing
   publications), then alerted authors to these retractions. Citing
   publications were randomized to up to three e-mails to contact author
   with/without up to two coauthors, with/without the editor. After one
   year we assessed corrective action. We included 88 citing publications;
   51\% (45/88) had findings likely to change if retracted trials were
   removed, 87\% (39/45) likely substantially. 51\% (44/86) of contacted
   citing publications replied. Including three authors rather than the
   contact author alone was more likely to elicit a reply (P = 0.03).
   Including the editor did not increase replies (P = 0.66). Whether
   findings were judged likely to change, and size of the likely change,
   had no effect on response rate or action taken. One year after e-mails
   were sent only nine publications had published notifications. E-Mail
   alerts to authors and editors are inadequate to correct the impact of
   retracted publications in citing systematic reviews and guidelines.
   Changes to bibliographic and referencing systems, and submission
   processes are needed. Citing publications with retracted citations
   should be marked until authors resolve concerns.},

Title = {Research misconduct in health and life sciences research: A systematic
   review of retracted literature from Brazilian institutions},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background
   Measures to ensure research integrity have been widely discussed due to
   the social, economic and scientific impact of research integrity. In the
   past few years, financial support for health research in emerging
   countries has steadily increased, resulting in a growing number of
   scientific publications. These achievements, however, have been
   accompanied by a rise in retracted publications followed by concerns
   about the quality and reliability of such publications.
   Objective
   This systematic review aimed to investigate the profile of medical and
   life sciences research retractions from authors affiliated with
   Brazilian academic institutions. The chronological trend between
   publication and retraction date, reasons for the retraction, citation of
   the article after the retraction, study design, and the number of
   retracted publications by author and affiliation were assessed.
   Additionally, the quality, availability and accessibility of data
   regarding retracted papers from the publishers are described.
   Methods
   Two independent reviewers searched for articles that had been retracted
   since 2004 via PubMed, Web of Science, Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (BVS)
   and Google Scholar databases. Indexed keywords from Medical Subject
   Headings (MeSH) and Descritores em Ciencias da Saude (DeCS) in
   Portuguese, English or Spanish were used. Data were also collected from
   the Retraction Watch website (www.retractionwatch.com). This study was
   registered with the PROSPERO systematic review database
   (CRD42017071647).
   Results
   A final sample of 65 articles was retrieved from 55 different journals
   with reported impact factors ranging from 0 to 32.86, with a median
   value of 4.40 and a mean of 4.69. The types of documents found were
   erratum (1), retracted articles (3), retracted articles with a
   retraction notice (5), retraction notices with erratum (3), and
   retraction notices (45). The assessment of the Retraction Watch website
   added 8 articles that were not identified by the search strategy using
   the bibliographic databases. The retracted publications covered a wide
   range of study designs. Experimental studies (40) and literature reviews
   (15) accounted for 84.6\% of the retracted articles. Within the field of
   health and life sciences, medical science was the field with the largest
   number of retractions (34), followed by biological sciences (17). Some
   articles were retracted for at least two distinct reasons (13). Among
   the retrieved articles, plagiarism was the main reason for retraction
   (60\%). Missing data were found in 57\% of the retraction notices, which
   was a limitation to this review. In addition, 63\% of the articles were
   cited after their retraction.
   Conclusion
   Publications are not retracted solely for research misconduct but also
   for honest error. Nevertheless, considering authors affiliated with
   Brazilian institutions, this review concluded that most of the retracted
   health and life sciences publications were retracted due to research
   misconduct. Because the number of publications is the most valued
   indicator of scientific productivity for funding and career progression
   purposes, a systematic effort from the national research councils,
   funding agencies, universities and scientific journals is needed to
   avoid an escalating trend of research misconduct. More investigations
   are needed to comprehend the underlying factors of research misconduct
   and its increasing manifestation.},

Title = {Continued Citation of Retracted Radiation Oncology Literature-Do We Have
   a Problem?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1036-1042},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantify the number and
   explore the nature of citations of retracted articles in the radiation
   oncology literature occurring after publication of the retraction note.
   Methods and Materials: A list of previously identified retracted
   articles within the field of radiation oncology was updated in June
   2017. The number of publications citing retracted articles was
   quantified using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies
   citing retracted publications after publication of the retraction note
   were individually assessed to determine the nature of the reference.
   Results: Forty-seven retracted articles were identified for this study.
   Thirty-seven studies (79\%) received 1017 citations before retraction,
   and 34 articles (72\%) received 407 English and 169 foreign-language
   citations afterward. The average number of citations dropped from 22 to
   11 after publication of the retraction note (95\% confidence interval,
   0.3-21.0, P=.043). Most postretraction citations occurred during the
   second year after the article's retraction, originated from North
   America and Asia (N=124 each, 31\%) and Europe (N=122, 30\%), and
   featured in original articles (N=254, 62\%) and reviews (N=73, 18\%). Of
   the 358 individually evaluable citing studies, 92\% referenced the
   retracted article as legitimate work. Three guidelines and 15 systematic
   reviews and meta-analyses were also identified that cited retracted
   articles as valid work.
   Conclusions: Postretraction citations are an avoidable phenomenon. The
   results of the study emphasize the need for investigators to adhere to
   good research practices to mitigate the influence and propagation of
   flawed and unethical research. Journal editors, peer reviewers, and the
   broader radiation oncology readership should remain diligent in ensuring
   that citations of retracted work are identified and removed before,
   during, and possibly even after publication. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {A major problem in scientific literature is the citation of retracted
   research. Until now, no long-term follow-up of the course of citations
   of such articles has been published. In the present study, we determined
   the development of citations of retracted articles based on the case of
   anaesthesiologist and pain researcher Scott S. Reuben, over a period of
   10 years and compared them to matched controls. We screened four
   databases to find retracted publications by Scott S. Ruben and reviewed
   full publications for indications of retraction status. To obtain a
   case-controlled analysis, all Reuben's retracted articles were compared
   with the respective citations of the preceeding and subsequent
   neighbouring articles within the same journal. There were 420 citations
   between 2009 and 2019, of which only 40\% indicated the publication
   being retracted. Over a 10-year period, an increasing linear trend is
   observed in citations of retracted articles by Scott S. Ruben that are
   not reported as retracted (R-2 = 0.3647). Reuben's retracted articles
   were cited 92\% more often than the neighbouring non-retracted articles.
   This study highlights a major scientific problem. Invented or falsified
   data are still being cited after more than a decade, leading to a
   distortion of the evidence and scientometric parameters.},

Journal = {HEALTH INFORMATION AND LIBRARIES JOURNAL},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {210-215},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: To explore how often newspapers cover the retraction of a
   medical journal article and whether newspaper coverage corresponds with
   the appearance of a press release about the retraction.
   Methods: Fifty citations were identified in PubMed that had been indexed
   with the Medical Subject Heading `Retracted Publication'. Next, the
   archives of LexisNexis's `Major Newspapers' and EurekAlert's press
   releases were searched to find references to those retracted
   publications.
   Results: Newspaper articles addressed exactly three of the 50 retracted
   publications, and press releases, exactly four of the 50 retracted
   publications. All three retracted publications that received newspaper
   coverage also had a press release. In other words, newspapers only
   covered a retraction that had been introduced by a press release.
   Conclusion: One would expect that newspaper coverage would increase
   after a press release, but the suggested relationships among a medical
   journal article retraction, a press release and newspaper coverage
   should be further investigated. If the linkage suggested by the data of
   this study holds, and if newspaper coverage stimulates library patron
   interest, then a medical library might prepare itself for information
   requests following a press release.},

Title = {Publication misconduct and plagiarism retractions: a systematic,

Journal = {CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1575-1583},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives:
   To investigate whether plagiarism is more prevalent in publications
   retracted from the medical literature when first authors are affiliated
   with lower-income countries versus higher-income countries. Secondary
   objectives included investigating other factors associated with
   plagiarism (e. g., national language of the first author's country
   affiliation, publication type, journal ranking).
   Design:
   Systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study.
   Data source:
   Retracted publications dataset in MEDLINE (search filters: English,
   human, January 1966-February 2008).
   Data selection:
   Retracted misconduct publications were classified according to the first
   author's country affiliation, country income level, and country national
   language, publication type, and ranking of the publishing journal.
   Standardised definitions and data collection tools were used; data were
   analysed (odds ratio {[}OR], 95\% confidence limits {[}CL], chi-squared
   tests) by an independent academic statistician.
   Results:
   Of the 213 retracted misconduct publications, 41.8\% (89/213) were
   retracted for plagiarism, 52.1\% (111/213) for
   falsification/fabrication, 2.3\% (5/213) for author disputes, 2.3\%
   (5/213) for ethical issues, and 1.4\% (3/213) for unknown reasons. The
   OR (95\% CL) of plagiarism retractions (other misconduct retractions as
   reference) were higher (P<0.001) for first authors affiliated with
   lower-income versus higher-income countries (15.4 {[}4.5, 52.9]) and
   with non-English versus English national language countries (3.2 {[}1.8,
   5.7]), for non-original research versus original research publications
   (8.4 {[}3.3, 21.3]), for case reports and series versus other original
   research types (4.2 {[}1.4, 13.0]), and for publications in low-ranked
   versus high-ranked journals (4.9 {[}2.4, 9.9]). Up until 2012, there
   were significantly (P<0.007) fewer `serial offenders' (first authors
   with >1 retraction) with publications retracted for plagiarism (11.5\%,
   9/78) than other types of misconduct (28.9\%, 24/83).
   Conclusions:
   This is the first study to demonstrate that publications retracted for
   plagiarism are significantly associated with first authors affiliated
   with lower-income countries. These findings have implications for
   developing appropriate evidence-based strategies and allocation of
   resources to help mitigate plagiarism misconduct.},

Title = {Retracted articles in surgery journals. What are surgeons doing wrong?},
Journal = {SURGERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {163},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1201-1206},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Retraction of previously published scientific articles is an
   important mechanism to preserve the integrity of scientific work. This
   study analyzed retractions of previously published articles from surgery
   journals.
   Methods: We searched for retracted articles in the 100 surgery journals
   with the highest SJR2 indicator grades.
   Results: We found 130 retracted articles in 49 journals (49\%). Five or
   more retracted articles were published in 8 journals (8\%). The mean
   time between publication and retraction was 26 months (range 1 to 158
   months). The United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United
   Kingdom accounted for more than 3 out of 4 of the retracted articles.
   The greatest number of retractions came from manuscripts about
   orthopedics and traumatology, general surgery, anesthesiology,
   cardiothoracic surgery, and plastic surgery. Nonsurgeons were
   responsible for 16\% of retractions in these surgery journals. The main
   reasons for retraction were duplicate publication (42\%), plagiarism
   (16\%), absence of proven integrity of the study (14\%), incorrect data
   (13\%), data published without authorization (12\%), violation of
   research ethics (11\%), documented fraud (11\%), request of an author(s)
   (5\%), and unknown (3\%). In 25\% of the retracted articles, other
   publications by the same authors also had been retracted.
   Conclusion: Retraction of published articles does not occur frequently
   in surgery journals. Some form of scientific misconduct was present in
   the majority of retractions, especially duplication of publication and
   plagiarism. Retractions of previously published articles were most
   frequent from countries with the greatest number of publications; some
   authors showed recidivism. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have examined retracted publications in different subject fields and
   attempted to analyse whether online free accessibility (Open Access)
   influences retraction by examining the scholarly literature published
   from 2000 through 2019, an incidence of the recent 20 years of
   publications. InCites, a research analytics tool developed by Clarivate
   Analytics (R), in consultation with Web of Science, PubMed Central, and
   Retraction Watch databases were used to harvest data for the study.
   Retracted `Article' and `Review' publications were examined concerning
   their online accessibility mode (Toll Access and Open Access), based on
   non-parametric tests like Odds Ratio, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test,
   Mann-Whitney U Test, Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods. The Odds for OA
   articles to have retraction are about 1.62 as large (62\% higher)
   compared with TA articles (95\% CI 1.5, 1.7). 0.028\% of OA publications
   are retracted compared with 0.017\% TA publications. Retractions have
   occurred in all subject areas. In eight subject areas, the Odds for
   retraction of OA articles are larger compared with retraction of TA
   articles. In three subject areas, the Odds for retraction of OA articles
   are lesser compared with the retraction of TA articles. In the remaining
   11 subject areas, no significant difference is observed.
   Post-retraction, though a decline is observed in the citation count of
   OA \& TA publications (p < .01), yet the Odds for OA articles to get
   cited after retraction are about 1.21 as large (21\% higher) compared
   with TA articles (95\% CI 1.53, 1.72). TA publications are retracted
   earlier compared to OA publications (p < .01). We observed an increasing
   trend of retracted works published in both modes. However, the rate of
   retraction of OA publications is double than the rate of retraction of
   TA publications.},

Abstract = {Perpetuation of retracted publications is an ongoing and even increasing
   problem in the scientific community. In addition to the direct
   distortion of scientific credibility, the use of retracted findings for
   interpretation und discussion in subsequent publications poses the risk
   of drawing false and, for example in medical research, even harmful
   conclusions. One major contributor to this development is that many
   authors are not aware of the retraction status of a paper they cite.
   COPE guidelines state that the ``retracted status should be indicated as
   clearly as possible{''}, but this is definitely not true for many
   retracted publications. Likewise, databases do not consequently link
   retracted articles with the notice of retraction. Furthermore, many
   papers are deposit in the ``original{''}, i.e. pre-retraction version on
   personal or institutional websites or online repositories. Similarly,
   printed ``stock files{''} are obviously unaffected by a retraction.
   Clear identification of a retracted article using a watermark and in
   databases is a crucial step while incorporation of an electronic
   ``retraction check{''} in reference management software and during the
   online submission is necessary to detect and avoid citing retracted
   literature. Solving this problem needs the close attention of everybody
   involved in the publishing process: authors, reviewers, and publishers.},

Title = {Self-correction in biomedical publications and the scientific impact},
Journal = {CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-72},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Aim To analyze mistakes and misconduct in multidisciplinary and
   specialized biomedical journals.
   Methods We conducted searches through PubMed to retrieve errata,
   duplicate, and retracted publications (as of January 30, 2014). To
   analyze publication activity and citation profiles of countries,
   multidisciplinary, and specialized biomedical journals, we referred to
   the latest data from the SCImago Journal \& Country Rank database. Total
   number of indexed articles and values of the h-index of the fifty most
   productive countries and multidisciplinary journals were recorded and
   linked to the number of duplicate and retracted publications in PubMed.
   Results Our analysis found 2597 correction items. A striking increase in
   the number of corrections appeared in 2013, which is mainly due to 871
   (85.3\%) corrections from PLOS One. The number of duplicate publications
   was 1086. Articles frequently published in duplicate were reviews
   (15.6\%), original studies (12.6\%), and case reports (7.6\%), whereas
   top three retracted articles were original studies (10.1\%), randomized
   trials (8.8\%), and reviews (7\%). A strong association existed between
   the total number of publications across countries and duplicate (r(s) =
   0.86, P < 0.001) and retracted items (r(s) = 0.812, P < 0.001). A
   similar trend was found between country-based h-index values and
   duplicate and retracted publications.
   Conclusion The study suggests that the intensified self-correction in
   biomedicine is due to the attention of readers and authors, who spot
   errors in their hub of evidence-based information. Digitization and open
   access confound the staggering increase in correction notices and
   retractions.},

Title = {Retractions in orthopaedic research A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW},
Journal = {BONE \& JOINT RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {263-268},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Despite the fact that research fraud and misconduct are under scrutiny
   in the field of orthopaedic research, little systematic work has been
   done to uncover and characterise the underlying reasons for academic
   retractions in this field. The purpose of this study was to determine
   the rate of retractions and identify the reasons for retracted
   publications in the orthopaedic literature.
   Methods
   Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane
   Library (1995 to current) using MeSH keyword headings and the
   `retracted' filter. We also searched an independent website that reports
   and archives retracted scientific publications
   (www.retractionwatch.com). Two reviewers independently extracted data
   including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and
   country of origin.
   Results
   One hundred and ten retracted studies were included for data extraction.
   The retracted studies were published in journals with impact factors
   ranging from 0.000 (discontinued journals) to 13.262. In the 20-year
   search window, only 25 papers were retracted in the first ten years,
   with the remaining 85 papers retracted in the most recent decade. The
   most common reasons for retraction were fraudulent data (29), plagiarism
   (25) and duplicate publication (20). Retracted articles have been cited
   up to 165 times (median 6; interquartile range 2 to 19).
   Conclusion
   The rate of retractions in the orthopaedic literature is increasing,
   with the majority of retractions attributed to academic misconduct and
   fraud. Orthopaedic retractions originate from numerous journals and
   countries, indicating that misconduct issues are widespread. The results
   of this study highlight the need to address academic integrity when
   training the next generation of orthopaedic investigators.},

Abstract = {In the battle for better science, the research community must
   obliterate, at times, works from the publication record, a process known
   as retraction. Additionally, publications and papers accumulate an
   altmetric attention score, which is a complementary metric to
   citation-based metrics. We used the citations, Journal Impact Factor,
   time between publication and retraction and the reasons behind
   retraction in order to find determinants of the retracted papers
   altmetric attention score. To find these determinants we compared two
   samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one
   of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random. We used
   a binary choice model to estimate the probability of being retracted due
   to misconduct or error. The model shows positive effects of altmetric
   scores and the time between publication and retraction on the
   probability to be retracted due to misconduct in the top sample. We
   conclude that there is an association between retraction due to
   misconduct and higher altmetric attention scores within the top sample.},

Abstract = {Background Increasing awareness of scientific misconduct has prompted
   various fields of medicine, including orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery,
   and dentistry to characterize the reasons for article retraction. The
   purpose of this review was to evaluate the reasons for and the rate of
   article retraction in the field of anesthesia within the last 30 years.
   Methods Based on a reproducible search strategy, two independent
   reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Retraction Watch website to
   identify retracted anesthesiology articles. Extracted data included:
   author names, year of publication, year of the retracted article,
   journal name, journal five-year impact factor, research type (clinical,
   basic science, or review), reason for article retraction, number of
   citations, and presence of a watermark indicating article retraction.
   Results Three hundred and fifty articles were included for data
   extraction. Reasons for article retraction could be grouped into six
   broad categories. The most common reason for retraction was fraud (data
   fabrication or manipulation), which accounted for nearly half (49.4\%)
   of all retractions, followed by lack of appropriate ethical approval
   (28\%). Other reasons for retraction included publication issues (e.g.,
   duplicate publications), plagiarism, and studies with methodologic or
   other non-fraud data issues. Four authors were associated with most of
   the retracted articles (59\%). The majority (69\%) of publications
   utilized a watermark on the original article to indicate that the
   article was retracted. Journal Citation Reports journal impact factors
   ranged from 0.9 to 48.1 (median {[}interquartile range (IQR)], 3.6
   {[}2.5-4.0]), and the most cited article was referenced 197 times
   (median {[}IQR], 13 {[}5-26]). Most retracted articles (66\%) were cited
   at least once by other journal articles after having been withdrawn.
   Conclusions Most retracted articles in anesthesiology literature were
   retracted because of research misconduct. Limited information is
   available in the retraction notices, unless explicitly stated, so it is
   challenging to distinguish between an honest error and research
   misconduct. Therefore, a standardized reporting process with structured
   retraction notices is desired.},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: To survey the citations of retracted
   non-Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) in scientific literature. Methods:
   We searched the Web of Science and Google Scholar from their inception
   to 30 April 2020 to find the citations of 153 previously identified
   retracted non-Cochrane SRs. We calculated the numbers of citations
   before and after retraction separately. We also described how the
   citation addressed the retraction and how it was used in the article.
   Results: A We identified 954 citations of 128 retracted SRs. The number
   of retracted SRs and citations reached the peak in 2014 and 2016,
   respectively, and the majority of the citations (n 5 580, 60.8\%) were
   in articles published after the SR was retracted. The mean number of
   citation per retracted SRs was 7.5. 2.6 before and 4.5 after the
   publication of the retraction notice. Twenty-nine (5.0\%) citations
   indicated the retraction of the SRs in the reference section. Nine of
   these citations supported the retracted SR's results, and 15 disagreed
   with them. Conclusion: Retracted SRs continue to be cited after the
   publication of the retraction notice. Standardized methods are needed to
   guide the management of retractions and avoid inappropriate citations of
   retracted articles. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {A faked peer review is a novel cause for retraction. We reviewed the
   characteristics of papers retracted due to a faked peer review. All
   papers retracted due to faked peer reviews were identified by searching
   the Retraction Watch website and by conducting a manual search. All
   identified papers were confirmed in published journals. The information
   of retracted papers was collected, which primarily included publisher,
   journal, journal impact factor, country, as well as publication and
   retraction year. Overall, 250 retracted papers were identified. They
   were published in 48 journals by six publishers. The top 5 journals
   included the Journal of Vibration and Control (24.8\%), Molecular
   Biology Reports (11.6\%), Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology
   (8.0\%), Tumour Biology (6.8\%) and European Journal of Medical Research
   (6.4\%). The publishers included SAGE (31\%), Springer (26\%), BioMed
   Central (18\%), Elsevier (13\%), Informa (11\%) and LWW (1\%). A
   minority (4\%) of retracted papers were published in Science Citation
   Index (SCI) journals with an impact factor of >5. A majority (74.8\%) of
   retracted papers were written by Chinese researchers. In terms of the
   publication year, the retracted papers were published since 2010, and
   the number of retracted papers peaked in 2014 (40.8\%). In terms of the
   retraction year, the retractions started in 2012, and the number of
   retractions peaked in 2015 (59.6\%). The number of papers retracted due
   to faked peer reviews differs largely among journals and countries. With
   the improvement of the peer review mechanism and increased education
   about publishing ethics, such academic misconduct may gradually
   disappear in future.},

Abstract = {Studies have indicated that the number and frequency of fraudulent
   publications being retracted are not subsiding even with greater
   awareness of such incidents in the recent decades. In this study, the
   trends of retraction period, number of citations and coauthors of 5
   selected researchers who had 15 fraudulent publications retracted were
   analyzed. The obtained results shows that the retraction period is 48.96
   +/- 32.16 months for the 113 publications affiliated to the 5 studied
   researchers. There are a total of 180 coauthors with 6.40 +/- 3.26
   coauthors per researcher's retracted publication. The linear regression
   analysis indicates that there is limited correlation (R-2 = .008)
   between the citation counts and retraction period. The p value for
   multiple F-tests to assess the number of coauthors to a fraudulent
   publication on an interresearcher basis is found to be ranging from <
   .001 to .458. It is also found that a better correlation (R-2 = .592)
   exists between the likelihood of a researcher to involve different
   individuals for isolated fraudulent publications while only selecting
   very few to be their frequent coauthors of their mischievous acts. With
   this study, the possible use of coauthors as a strategy for publishing
   fraudulent work and a potential approach to tighten coauthorship are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Retracted papers often circulate widely on social media, digital news,
   and other websites before their official retraction. The spread of
   potentially inaccurate or misleading results from retracted papers can
   harm the scientific community and the public. Here, we quantify the
   amount and type of attention 3,851 retracted papers received over time
   in different online platforms. Comparing with a set of nonretracted
   control papers from the same journals with similar publication year,
   number of coauthors, and author impact, we show that retracted papers
   receive more attention after publication not only on social media but
   also, on heavily curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge
   repositories, amplifying the negative impact on the public. At the same
   time, we find that posts on Twitter tend to express more criticism about
   retracted than about control papers, suggesting that
   criticism-expressing tweets could contain factual information about
   problematic papers. Most importantly, around the time they are
   retracted, papers generate discussions that are primarily about the
   retraction incident rather than about research findings, showing that by
   this point, papers have exhausted attention to their results and
   highlighting the limited effect of retractions. Our findings reveal the
   extent to which retracted papers are discussed on different online
   platforms and identify at scale audience criticism toward them. In this
   context, we show that retraction is not an effective tool to reduce
   online attention to problematic papers.},

Title = {Comprehensive analysis of retracted journal articles in the field of
   veterinary medicine and animal health},
Journal = {BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {Background: Retractions are a key proxy for recognizing errors in
   research and publication and for reconciling misconduct in the
   scientific literature. The underlying factors associated with
   retractions can provide insight and guide policy for journal editors and
   authors within a discipline. The goal of this study was to
   systematically review and analyze retracted articles in veterinary
   medicine and animal health. A database search for retractions of
   articles with a veterinary/animal health topic, in a veterinary journal,
   or by veterinary institution-affiliated authors was conducted from first
   available records through February 2019 in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of
   Science, Scopus, Retraction Watch, and Google Scholar. Annual frequency
   of retractions, journal and article characteristics, author affiliation
   and country, reasons for retraction, and retraction outcomes were
   recorded.
   Results: Two-hundred-forty-two articles retracted between 1993 and 2019
   were included in the study. Over this period, the estimated rate of
   retraction increased from 0.03/1000 to 1.07/1000 veterinary articles.
   Median time from publication to retraction was 478 days (range 0-3653
   days). Retracted articles were published in 30 (12.3\%) veterinary
   journals and 132 (81.5\%) nonveterinary journals. Veterinary journals
   had disproportionately more retractions than nonveterinary journals (P =
   .0155). Authors/groups with >= 2 retractions accounted for 37.2\% of
   retractions. Authors from Iran and China published 19.4 and 18.2\% of
   retracted articles respectively. Authors were affiliated with a faculty
   of veterinary medicine in 59.1\% of retracted articles. Of 242
   retractions, 204 (84.3\%) were research articles, of which 6.4\% were
   veterinary clinical research. Publication misconduct (plagiarism,
   duplicate publication, compromised peer review) accounted for 75.6\% of
   retractions, compared with errors (20.6\%) and research misconduct
   (18.2\%). Journals published by societies/institutions were less likely
   than those from commercial publishers to indicate a reason for
   retraction. Thirty-one percent of HTML articles and 14\% of PDFs were
   available online but not marked as retracted.
   Conclusions: The rate of retraction in the field of veterinary and
   animal health has increased by similar to 10-fold per 1000 articles
   since 1993, resulting primarily from increased publication misconduct,
   often by repeat offenders. Veterinary journals and society/institutional
   journals could benefit from improvement in the quality of retraction
   notices.},

Abstract = {Objective: To analyze the retraction status and reasons of non-Cochrane
   systematic reviews (SRs) in medicine. Study Design and Setting: MEDLINE,
   Embase, Retraction Watch Database and Google Scholar were systematically
   searched to find all retracted non-Cochrane SRs. Results: Of 159
   non-Cochrane SRs in medicine retracted between 2004 and 2020, more than
   70\% were led by authors from China and affiliated with hospitals. The
   largest proportion of retraction notices were issued by the publisher
   and editor(s) jointly. Fraudulent peer-review was the most common reason
   for retraction, followed by unreliable data meaning errors in study
   selection or data analysis. The median time between publication and
   retraction was 14 months, and SRs retracted due to research misconduct
   took longer to retract than honest error. Conclusion: The total number
   of retracted SRs is increasing worldwide, in particular in China. The
   most common reasons for retraction are fraudulent peer-review and
   unreliable data, and in most cases the SR is retracted more than a year
   after publication. Better systems of ethical oversight and culture to
   improve the process of peer review and adherence to the COPE retraction
   guidance are needed, and authors should strengthen their skills in SR
   methodology. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. This is

Abstract = {Methodological mistakes, data errors, and scientific misconduct are
   considered prevalent problems in science that are often difficult to
   detect. In this study, we explore the potential of using data from
   Twitter for discovering problems with publications. In this case study,
   we analyzed tweet texts of three retracted publications about COVID-19
   (Coronavirus disease 2019)/SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2) and their retraction notices. We did not find early
   warning signs in tweet texts regarding one publication, but we did find
   tweets that casted doubt on the validity of the two other publications
   shortly after their publication date. An extension of our current work
   might lead to an early warning system that makes the scientific
   community aware of problems with certain publications. Other sources,
   such as blogs or post-publication peer-review sites, could be included
   in such an early warning system. The methodology proposed in this case
   study should be validated using larger publication sets that also
   include a control group, i.e., publications that were not retracted.},

Title = {Retractions in the research literature: misconduct or mistakes?},
Journal = {MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {185},
Number = {3},
Pages = {152-154},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Objective: To determine how commonly articles are retracted on the basis
   of unintentional mistakes, and whether these articles differ from those
   retracted for scientific misconduct in authorship, funding, type of
   study, publication, and time to retraction.
   Data source and study selection: All retractions of English language
   publications indexed in MEDLINE between 1982 and 2002 were extracted.
   Data extraction: Two reviewers categorised the reasons for retraction of
   each article as misconduct (falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism)
   or unintentional error (mistakes in sampling, procedures, or data
   analysis; failure to reproduce findings; accidental omission of
   information about methods or data analysis).
   Data synthesis: Of the 395 articles retracted between 1982 and 2002, 107
   (27.1\%) were retracted because of scientific misconduct, 244 (61.8\%)
   because of unintentional errors, and 44 (11.1\%) could not be
   categorised. Compared with articles retracted because of misconduct,
   articles with unintentional mistakes were more likely to have multiple
   authors, no reported funding source, and to be published in frequently
   cited journals. They were more likely to be retracted by the author(s)
   of the article, and the retraction was more likely to occur more
   promptly (mean, 2.0 years; 95\% Cl, 1.8-2.2) than articles withdrawn
   because of misconduct (mean, 3.3 years; 95\% Cl, 2.7-3.9) (P < 0.05 for
   all comparisons).
   Conclusions: Retractions in the biomedical literature were more than
   twice as likely to result from unintentional mistakes than from
   scientific misconduct. The different characteristics of articles
   retracted for misconduct and for mistakes reflect distinct causes and,
   potentially, distinct solutions.},

Title = {Post retraction citations among manuscripts reporting a
   radiology-imaging diagnostic method},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 13},
Abstract = {Our study aimed to evaluate the trends of post retraction citations of
   articles reporting a radiology-imaging diagnostic method and to find if
   a different pattern exists between manuscripts reporting an ultrasound
   method and those reporting other radiology diagnostic methods. This
   study reviewed retractions stored in PubMed on the subject of
   radiology-imaging diagnosis to identify the motivation, time from
   publication to retraction, and citations before and after retraction.
   The PubMed database was searched on June 2017 to retrieve the retracted
   articles, and the Scopus database was screened to identify the
   post-retraction citations. The full text was screened to see the type of
   post-retraction citation (positive/negative) and whether the cited
   article appears or not as retracted. One hundred and two retractions
   were identified, representing 3.5\% of the retracted articles indexed by
   PubMed, out of which 54 were included in the analysis. Half of the
   articles were retracted in the first 24 months after publication, and
   the number of post retraction citations was higher than the number of
   citations before retraction in 30 out of 54 cases (US methods: 9/20,
   other diagnostic methods 21/34, P-value = 0.2312). The plagiarism was
   the most common reason for retraction (31\%), followed by repetitive
   publication (26\%), and errors in data/manuscript (24\%). In less than
   2\% of cases, the retracted articles appear as retracted in the text or
   reference list, while the negative citation is observed in 4.84\% among
   manuscripts reporting an US diagnostic method and 0.32\% among
   manuscripts reporting a diagnostic method other than US (P-value =
   0.0004). No significant differences were observed when post retraction
   weighted citation index (WCI, no. of citations weighted by citation
   window) was compared to WCI prior retraction (P-value = 0.5972). In
   light of the reported results, we enumerated some recommendations that
   could potentially minimize the referral to retracted studies as valid.},

Title = {Retraction of Neurosurgical Publications: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {809+},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite the increasing awareness of scientific fraud, no
   attempt has been made to assess its prevalence in neurosurgery. The aim
   of our review was to assess the chronologic trend, reasons, research
   type/design, and country of origin of retracted neurosurgical
   publications.
   METHODS: Three independent reviewers searched the EMBASE and MEDLINE
   databases using neurosurgical keywords for retracted articles from 1995
   to 2016. Archives of retracted articles (retractionwatch.com) and the
   independent Web sites of neurosurgical journals were also searched. Data
   including the journal, impact factor, reason for retraction, country of
   origin, and citations were extracted.
   RESULTS: A total of 97 studies were included for data extraction.
   Journal impact factor ranged from 0.57 to 35.03. Most studies ( 61) were
   retracted within the last 5 years. The most common reason for retraction
   was because of a duplicated publication found elsewhere (26), followed
   closely by plagiarism (22), or presenting fraudulent data (14). Other
   reasons included scientific errors/mistakes, author misattribution, and
   compromised peer review. Articles originated from several countries and
   some were widely cited.
   CONCLUSIONS: Retractions of neurosurgical publications are increasing
   significantly, mostly because of issues of academic integrity, including
   duplicate publishing and plagiarism. Implementation of more transparent
   data-sharing repositories and thorough screening of data before
   manuscript submission, as well as additional educational programs for
   new researchers, may help mitigate these issues in the future.},

Title = {A Comprehensive Survey of Retracted Articles from the Scholarly
   Literature},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background: The number of retracted scholarly articles has risen
   precipitously in recent years. Past surveys of the retracted literature
   each limited their scope to articles in PubMed, though many retracted
   articles are not indexed in PubMed. To understand the scope and
   characteristics of retracted articles across the full spectrum of
   scholarly disciplines, we surveyed 42 of the largest bibliographic
   databases for major scholarly fields and publisher websites to identify
   retracted articles. This study examines various trends among them.
   Results: We found, 4,449 scholarly publications retracted from
   1928-2011. Unlike Math, Physics, Engineering and Social Sciences, the
   percentages of retractions in Medicine, Life Science and Chemistry
   exceeded their percentages among Web of Science (WoS) records.
   Retractions due to alleged publishing misconduct (47\%) outnumbered
   those due to alleged research misconduct (20\%) or questionable
   data/interpretations (42\%). This total exceeds 100\% since multiple
   justifications were listed in some retraction notices. Retraction/WoS
   record ratios vary among author affiliation countries. Though
   widespread, only miniscule percentages of publications for individual
   years, countries, journals, or disciplines have been retracted. Fifteen
   prolific individuals accounted for more than half of all retractions due
   to alleged research misconduct, and strongly influenced all retraction
   characteristics. The number of articles retracted per year increased by
   a factor of 19.06 from 2001 to 2010, though excluding repeat offenders
   and adjusting for growth of the published literature decreases it to a
   factor of 11.36.
   Conclusions: Retracted articles occur across the full spectrum of
   scholarly disciplines. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed
   data; and the authors of most retracted articles have not been accused
   of research misconduct. Despite recent increases, the proportion of
   published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very
   small. Articles and editorials discussing retractions, or their relation
   to research integrity, should always consider individual cases in these
   broad contexts. However, better mechanisms are still needed for raising
   researchers' awareness of the retracted literature in their field.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Fraud in medical publications is an increasing concern. In particular,
   disciplines related to perioperative medicine-including anaesthesia and
   critical care-currently hold the highest rankings in terms of retracted
   papers for research misconduct. The dominance of this dubious
   achievement is attributable to a limited number of researchers who have
   repeatedly committed scientific fraud. In the last three decades, six
   researchers have authored 421 of the 475 papers retracted in
   perioperative medicine. This narrative review reports on six cases of
   fabricated publication in perioperative medicine that resulted in the
   paper's retraction. The process that led to the unveiling of the fraud,
   the impact on clinical practice, and changes in regulatory mechanisms of
   scientific companies and governmental agencies' policies are also
   presented. Fraud in medical publications is a growing concern that
   affects perioperative medicine requiring a substantial number of papers
   to be retracted. The continuous control elicited by readers, by local
   institutional review boards, scientific journal reviewers, scientific
   societies and government agencies can play an important role in
   preserving the `pact of trust' between authors, professionals and
   ultimately the relationship between doctors and patients.},

Title = {Retracting Inconclusive Research: Lessons from the S,ralini GM Maize
   Feeding Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL \& ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {621-633},

Abstract = {In September 2012, Gilles-Eric S,ralini and seven coauthors published an
   article in Food and Chemical Toxicology claiming that rats fed RoundupA
   (c)-resistant genetically modified maize alone, genetically modified
   maize with RoundupA (c), or RoundupA (c) for 2 years had a higher
   percentage of tumors and kidney and liver damage than normal controls.
   Shortly after this study was published, numerous scientists and several
   scientific organizations criticized the research as methodologically and
   ethically flawed. In January 2014, the journal retracted the article
   without the authors' consent on the grounds that the research was
   inconclusive. In June 2014, Environmental Sciences Europe published a
   slightly modified version of the retracted paper. The publication,
   retraction and subsequent republication of the S,ralini study raise
   important scientific and ethical issues for journal editors. Decisions
   to retract an article should be made on the basis of well-established
   policies. Articles should be retracted only for serious errors that
   undermine the reliability of the data or results, or for serious ethical
   lapses, such as research misconduct or mistreatment of animal or human
   subjects. Inconclusiveness, by itself, is not a sufficient reason for
   retracting an article, though a flawed study design might be. Retracted
   articles that are submitted for republication should undergo scientific
   review to ensure that they meet appropriate standards. Republished
   articles should be linked to the original, retracted publication.
   Journals that are reviewing studies with significant scientific and
   social implications should take special care to ensure that peer review
   is rigorous and fair.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to identify retracted articles in the
   biomedical literature (co) authored by Indian authors and to examine the
   features of retracted articles. The PubMed database was searched to find
   the retracted articles in order to reach the goal. The search yielded
   508 records and retrieved for the detailed analysis of: authorships and
   collaboration type, funding information, who retracts? journals and
   impact factors, and reasons for retraction. The results show that most
   of the biomedical articles retracted were published after 2010 and
   common reasons are plagiarism and fake data for retraction. More than
   half of the retracted articles were co-authored within the institutions
   and there is no repeat offender. 25\% of retracted articles were
   published in the top 15 journals and 33\% were published in the
   non-impact factor journals. Average time from publication to retraction
   is calculated to 2.86 years and retractions due to fake data takes
   longest period among the reasons. Majority of the funded research was
   retracted due to fake data whereas it is plagiarism for non-funded.},

Abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed the rising prevalence of both
   co-publishing and retraction. Focusing on research collaboration, this
   paper utilizes a unique dataset to investigate factors contributing to
   retraction probability and elapsed time between publication and
   retraction. Data analysis reveals that the majority of retracted papers
   are multi-authored and that repeat offenders are collaboration prone.
   Yet, all things being equal, collaboration, in and of itself, does not
   increase the likelihood of producing flawed or fraudulent research, at
   least in the form of retraction. That holds for all retractions and also
   retractions due to falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism (FFP). The
   research also finds that publications with authors from elite
   universities are less likely to be retracted, which is particularly true
   for retractions due to FFP. China stands out with the fastest retracting
   speed compared to other countries. Possible explanations, limitations,
   and policy implications are also discussed.},

Title = {Correction of the Scientific Production: Publisher Performance
   Evaluation Using a Dataset of 4844 PubMed Retractions},
Journal = {PUBLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background. Retraction of problematic scientific articles after
   publication is one of the mechanisms for correcting the literature
   available to publishers. The market volume and the busi-ness model
   justify publishers' ethical involvement in the post-publication quality
   control (PPQC) of human-health-related articles. The limited information
   about this subject led us to analyze Pub-Med-retracted articles and the
   main retraction reasons grouped by publisher. We propose a score to
   appraise publisher's PPQC results. The dataset used for this article
   consists of 4844 Pub-Med-retracted papers published between 1.01.2009
   and 31.12.2020. Methods. An SDTP score was constructed from the dataset.
   The calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article
   exposure time (ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose
   retraction is initiated by the edi-tor/publisher/institution without the
   authors' participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles
   available online and the clarity of the retraction notes), and precision
   (mention of authors' responsibility and percentage of retractions for
   reasons other than editorial errors). Results. The 4844 retracted
   articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average
   number of retracted articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers
   have more than 10 retracted articles, holding 88\% of all papers and
   79\% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows
   that less than 7\% of PubMed dataset journals retracted at least one
   article. Only 10.5\% of the retraction notes included the individual
   responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the
   largest number of retracted articles in 2020. Retraction-reason analysis
   shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the
   articles' ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73
   months (images), and 10 and 42 months (plagiarism and overlap). The SDTP
   score shows, from 2018 to 2020, an improvement in PPQC of four
   publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th
   place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive
   evolution of the SDTP score. Conclusions. Publishers have to get
   involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of
   scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for
   retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC
   can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature.},

   per year for each prior publication. These chain reactions are sustained
   on authors' papers (a) published up to a decade earlier and (b)
   connected within the authors' own citation network by up to 4 degrees of
   separation from the retracted publication. Importantly, however,
   citation losses among prior work disappear when authors self-report the
   error. Our analyses and results span the range of scientific
   disciplines.},

Title = {Falsified papers in high-impact journals were slow to retract and
   indistinguishable from nonfraudulent papers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {464-470},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: The aim was to evaluate papers retracted due to falsification
   in high-impact journals.
   Study Design and Setting: We selected articles retracted due to
   allegations of falsification in January 1, 1980 to March 1, 2006 from
   journals with impact factor > 10 and > 30,000 annual citations. We
   evaluated characteristics of these papers and misconduct-involved
   authors and assessed whether they correlated with time to retraction. We
   also compared retracted articles vs. matched nonretracted articles in
   the same journals.
   Results: Fourteen eligible journals had 63 eligible retracted articles.
   Median time from publication to retraction was 28 months; it was 79
   months for articles where a senior researcher was implicated in the
   misconduct vs. 22 months when junior researchers were implicated
   (log-rank P < 0.001). For the 25 implicated authors, the median time
   from the first publication of a fraudulent paper to the first retraction
   was 34 months, again with a clear difference according to researcher
   rank (log-rank P = 0.001). Retracted articles didn't differ from matched
   nonretracted papers in citations received within 12 months, number of
   authors, country, funding, or field, but were twofold more likely to
   have multinational authorship (P = 0.049).
   Conclusions: Retractions due to falsification can take a long time,
   especially when senior researchers are implicated. Fraudulent articles
   are not obviously distinguishable from nonfraudulent ones. (c) 2008

Abstract = {In this article, we show and discuss the results of a quantitative and
   qualitative analysis of open citations of retracted publications in the
   humanities domain. Our study was conducted by selecting retracted papers
   in the humanities domain and marking their main characteristics (e.g.,
   retraction reason). Then, we gathered the citing entities and annotated
   their basic metadata (e.g., title, venue, subject) and the
   characteristics of their in-text citations (e.g., intent, sentiment).
   Using these data, we performed a quantitative and qualitative study of
   retractions in the humanities, presenting descriptive statistics and a
   topic modeling analysis of the citing entities' abstracts and the
   in-text citation contexts. As part of our main findings, we noticed that
   there was no drop in the overall number of citations after the year of
   retraction, with few entities that have either mentioned the retraction
   or expressed a negative sentiment toward the cited publication. In
   addition, on several occasions, we noticed a higher concern/awareness by
   citing entities belonging to the health sciences domain about citing a
   retracted publication, compared with the humanities and social science
   domains. Philosophy, arts, and history are the humanities areas that
   showed higher concern toward the retraction.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyze 343 retraction notices indexed in the Scopus
   database, published in 2001-2019, related to scientific articles
   (co-)written by at least one author affiliated with an Iranian
   institution. In order to determine reasons for retractions, we merged
   this database with the database from Retraction Watch. The data were
   analyzed using Excel 2016 and IBM-SPSS version 24.0, and visualized
   using VOSviewer software. Most of the retractions were due to fake peer
   review (95 retractions) and plagiarism (90). The average time between a
   publication and its retraction was 591 days. The maximum time-lag (about
   3000 days) occurred for papers retracted due to duplicate publications;
   the minimum time-lag (fewer than 100 days) was for papers retracted due
   to ``unspecified cause{''} (most of these were conference papers). As
   many as 48 (14\%) of the retracted papers were published in two medical
   journals: Tumor Biology (25 papers) and Diagnostic Pathology (23
   papers). From the institutional point of view, Islamic Azad University
   was the inglorious leader, contributing to over one-half (53.1\%) of
   retracted papers. Among the 343 retraction notices, 64 papers pertained
   to international collaborations with researchers from mainly Asian and
   European countries; Malaysia having the most retractions (22 papers).
   Since most retractions were due to fake peer review and plagiarism, the
   peer review system appears to be a weak point of the
   submission/publication process; if improved, the number of retractions
   would likely drop because of increased editorial control.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Published articles may be retracted when their findings are no longer
   considered reliable due to honest error, publication misconduct, or
   research misconduct. This article focuses on the case of a single serial
   violator of research and publication ethics in anesthesiology and
   critical care, which is widely publicized. A chain of events led to
   detection of misconduct that had substantial impact on the evidence base
   for the safety of hydroxyethyl starch, an intravenous artificial colloid
   solution, which is reflected in current guidelines on fluid management
   and volume resuscitation. As citations to retracted works continue to be
   a cause for concern, this article reviews the retraction status of this
   author's published articles to determine whether sufficient action has
   been taken to retract his body of work. Results show that retraction
   practices are not uniform and that guidelines for retraction are still
   not being fully implemented, resulting in retractions of insufficient
   quantity and quality. As retractions continue to emerge for the author's
   publications, with ten more since 2011, and as they are generally
   increasing, these data on retractions not only provide findings of
   misconduct, but also allow us to make inferences about ongoing
   weaknesses in the system of scientific literature.},

Title = {Silently withdrawn or retracted preprints related to Covid-19 are a
   scholarly threat and a potential public health risk: theoretical
   arguments and suggested recommendations},
Journal = {ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {751-757},
Abstract = {Purpose - Thousands of preprints related to Covid-19 have effused into
   the academic literature. Even though these are not peer-reviewed
   documents and have not been vetted by medical or other experts, several
   have been cited, while others have been widely promoted by the media.
   While many preprints eventually find their way into the published
   literature, usually through integrated publishing streams, there is a
   small body of preprints that have been opaquely withdrawn/retracted,
   without suitable reasons, leaving only a vestigial or skeletal record
   online. Others have, quite literally, vanished. This paper aims to
   examine some of those cases.
   Design/methodology/approach - For peer-reviewed literature, a retracted
   academic paper is usually watermarked with ``RETRACTED{''} across each
   page of the document, as recommended by ethical bodies such as the
   Committee on Publication Ethics, which represents thousands of journals
   and publishers. Curiously, even though pro-preprint groups claim that
   preprints are an integral part of the publication process and a
   scholarly instrument, there are no strict, detailed or established
   ethical guidelines for preprints on most preprint servers. This paper
   identifies select withdrawn/retracted preprints and emphasizes that the
   opaque removal of preprints from the scholarly record may constitute
   unscholarly, possibly even predatory or unethical, behavior.
   Findings - Strict ethical guidelines are urgently needed for preprints,
   and preprint authors, in the case of misconduct, should face the same
   procedure and consequences as standard peer-reviewed academic
   literature.
   Originality/value - Journals and publishers that have silently retracted
   or withdrawn preprints should reinstate them, as for regular retracted
   literature, except for highly exceptional cases.},

Abstract = {Publications of expressions of concern and retractions should be timely,
   accurate and comprehensive. We assessed these characteristics for 292
   publications by a research group about which we submitted concerns about
   publication integrity to 77 journals and 29 publishers between March
   2013 and February 2020. By October 2020, 115 publications were corrected
   (3), had expressions of concern (18), or were retracted (94). The median
   (95\% CI) time from submission of concerns to the first journal
   correction was 22.1 (18.2-26.9) months: this did not diminish by year of
   submission of concerns, varied between publishers, and was shorter for
   journals with higher impact factors. Eighty-four publications of
   original research were retracted. The median (range) proportion of
   concerns raised with the journal that were mentioned in the ensuing
   retraction notices was 9.5\% (2-49). At least 75\% of retraction notices
   included the suggested content for 7/9, 3/9 and 3/16 items in the
   Committee for Publication Ethics and Retraction Watch minimum and
   optimal recommended formats, respectively. Thus, assessment of concerns
   about publication integrity was delayed and incomplete. Adherence to
   recommended content of retraction notices was moderate at best.
   Strategies are needed to improve the efficiency, accuracy and
   transparency of processes for resolving concerns about publication
   integrity.},

Title = {Retracted randomized controlled trials were cited and not corrected in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Background and Objectives: To investigate whether and when the
   correction is done in Systematic Reviews (SRs) and Clinical Practice
   Guidelines (CPGs) when included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) have
   been retracted.
   Methods: In this meta-epidemiological study, we included SRs and CPGs
   citing the retracted RCTs from the Retraction Watch Database. We
   investigated how often the retracted RCTs were cited in SRs and CPGs. We
   also investigated whether and when such SRs and CPGs corrected
   themselves.
   Results: We identified 587 articles (525 SRs and 62 CPGs) citing
   retracted RCTs. Among the 587 articles, 252 (43\%) were published after
   retraction, and 335 (57\%) were published before retraction. Among 127
   articles published citing already retracted RCTs in their evidence
   synthesis without caution, none corrected themselves after publication.
   Of 335 articles published before retraction, 239 included RCTs that were
   later retracted in their evidence synthesis. Among them, only 5\% of SRs
   (9/196) and 5\% of CPGs (2/43) corrected or retracted their results.
   Conclusion: Many SRs and CPGs included already or later retracted RCTs
   without caution. Most of them were never corrected. The scientific
   community, including publishers and researchers, should make systematic
   and concerted efforts to remove the impact of retracted RCTs. (C) 2022

Abstract = {In case of scientific misconduct, the papers can be retracted at the
   request of the journal's editors and/or authors. However, the retracted
   articles continue to be fully available through online resources,
   including journals websites. This paper argues that a classical
   retraction is insufficient to mitigate the adverse effect some retracted
   papers continue to have on critical issues, e.g. public health. The more
   strict approach, `Hard Retraction', is presented for consideration. Its
   implementation would lead to (1) complete deletion of the full text of
   the retracted paper, (2) substitution of the original abstract with a
   detailed retraction notice, (3) removal of the paper from the citation
   databases, (4) deposition of the retracted paper in the dedicated
   repository accessible for registered members. The benefits and risks of
   such an approach are discussed. Nevertheless, it should only be reserved
   for cases of fraud or grave errors with broad impacts.},

Month = {2022 JUN 4},
Abstract = {The retraction of health sciences publications is a growing concern. To
   understand the patterns in a particular country-context and design
   specific measures to address the problem, it is important to describe
   and characterize retractions. We aimed to assess the evolution of health
   science retractions in Brazil and Portugal and to describe their
   features. We conducted a cross-sectional study including all health
   sciences retracted articles with at least one author affiliated to a
   Portuguese or Brazilian institution identified through Retraction Watch
   database. A total of 182 retracted articles were identified. The number
   of retractions increased over time, but the proportion related to the
   whole of publications remained stable. A total of 50.0\% and 60.8\% of
   the Portuguese and Brazilian retracted articles, respectively, were
   published in first and second quartile journals. Scientific misconduct
   accounted for 60.1\% and 55.9\% of retractions in Brazil and Portugal.
   In both countries, the most frequent cause of misconduct was plagiarism.
   The time from publication to retraction decreases as the journal
   quartile increases. The retraction of health sciences articles did not
   decrease over time in Brazil and Portugal. There is a need to develop
   strategies aimed at preventing, monitoring and managing scientific
   misconduct according to the country context.},

Abstract = {There are three main reasons for retraction: (1 ethical misconduct (e.g.
   duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB, ownership
   issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process, citation
   manipulation); (2 scientific distortion (e.g. data manipulation,
   fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable data validity,
   non-replicability, data errors - even if unintended); 3) administrative
   error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the final version
   published, publisher errors). The first category, although highly
   deplorable has no effect on the advancement of science, the third
   category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the second
   category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view, as they
   are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on
   science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal
   characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication,
   years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and
   social media attention by the three major categories. The data set
   comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from
   Elsevier's ScienceDirect.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this short communication is to identify and analyze
   retracted editorials in the biomedical literature. Twenty-five of the 33
   editorials are chosen for further analysis. All of the editorials were
   published as commentaries and concise reviews between 1998 and 2021. Due
   to plagiarism and data-related issues, the majority of the editorial
   articles were retracted. Alarmingly, one-fifth of the editorials were
   funded by external agencies, with the USA leading the list of retracted
   editorials. The average time between the publication of the editorials
   and their retraction is 2.48 years, and two editorials were retracted
   with the longest durations; both were written by the same author. The
   conclusion is that, at the very least, editorial articles should be
   devoid of research/scientific misconduct.},

Title = {Retractions in the scientific literature: do authors deliberately commit
   research fraud?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {113-117},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background Papers retracted for fraud (data fabrication or data
   falsification) may represent a deliberate effort to deceive, a
   motivation fundamentally different from papers retracted for error. It
   is hypothesised that fraudulent authors target journals with a high
   impact factor (IF), have other fraudulent publications, diffuse
   responsibility across many co-authors, delay retracting fraudulent
   papers and publish from countries with a weak research infrastructure.
   Methods All 788 English language research papers retracted from the
   PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Data pertinent to
   each retracted paper were abstracted from the paper and the reasons for
   retraction were derived from the retraction notice and dichotomised as
   fraud or error. Data for each retracted article were entered in an Excel
   spreadsheet for analysis.
   Results Journal IF was higher for fraudulent papers (p<0.001). Roughly
   53\% of fraudulent papers were written by a first author who had written
   other retracted papers ('repeat offender'), whereas only 18\% of
   erroneous papers were written by a repeat offender (chi=88.40;
   p<0.0001). Fraudulent papers had more authors (p<0.001) and were
   retracted more slowly than erroneous papers (p<0.005). Surprisingly,
   there was significantly more fraud than error among retracted papers
   from the USA (chi(2)=8.71; p<0.05) compared with the rest of the world.
   Conclusions This study reports evidence consistent with the `deliberate
   fraud' hypothesis. The results suggest that papers retracted because of
   data fabrication or falsification represent a calculated effort to
   deceive. It is inferred that such behaviour is neither naive, feckless
   nor inadvertent.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the features of retracted articles
   by authors affiliated with hospitals in mainland China. We searched the
   PubMed, Web of Science, and Retraction Watch databases for retractions
   and identified the following characteristics of each retracted article:
   publisher, open access status, impact factor of the journal that
   retracted the article, any PubPeer comments recorded before the
   retraction, status of the hospital where the authors worked, and any
   response to the retraction from the authors. We found 521 retractions,
   primarily by authors at grade A, third-level hospitals located in a
   limited number of regions of mainland China, and found that the journals
   that had published and later retracted the articles tended to have a
   medium to high impact factor. The main reasons for retraction were data
   manipulation, fabrication, or fraud; errors made by the authors; or
   plagiarism. Few of the retracted publications had PubPeer comments
   before their retraction. This is the first report to focus on retracted
   research coming out of hospitals in mainland China. The large number of
   retractions for Chinese hospitals is worrying. The results suggest that
   some retractions were related to third parties that provided editorial
   and other services.},

Title = {Data fabrication and other reasons for non-random sampling in 5087
   randomised, controlled trials in anaesthetic and general medical
   journals},
Journal = {ANAESTHESIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {72},
Number = {8},
Pages = {944-952},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Randomised, controlled trials have been retracted after publication
   because of data fabrication and inadequate ethical approval. Fabricated
   data have included baseline variables, for instance, age, height or
   weight. Statistical tests can determine the probability of the
   distribution of means, given their standard deviation and the number of
   participants in each group. Randomised, controlled trials have been
   retracted after the data distributions have been calculated as
   improbable. Most retracted trials have been written by anaesthetists and
   published by specialist anaesthetic journals. I wanted to explore
   whether the distribution of baseline data in trials was consistent with
   the expected distribution. I wanted to determine whether trials
   retracted after publication had distributions different to trials that
   have not been retracted. I wanted to determine whether data
   distributions in trials published in specialist anaesthetic journals
   have been different to distributions in non-specialist medical journals.
   I analysed the distribution of 72,261 means of 29,789 variables in 5087
   randomised, controlled trials published in eight journals between
   January 2000 and December 2015: Anaesthesia (399); Anesthesia and
   Analgesia (1288); Anesthesiology (541); British Journal of Anaesthesia
   (618); Canadian Journal of Anesthesia (384); European Journal of
   Anaesthesiology (404); Journal of the American Medical Association (518)
   and New England Journal of Medicine (935). I chose these journals as I
   had electronic access to the full text. Trial p values were distorted by
   an excess of baseline means that were similar and an excess that were
   dissimilar: 763/5015 (15.2\%) trials that had not been retracted from
   publication had p values that were within 0.05 of 0 or 1 (expected
   10\%), that is, a 5.2\% excess, p = 1.2 x 10(-7). The p values of 31/72
   (43\%) trials that had been retracted after publication were within 0.05
   of 0 or 1, a rate different to that for unretracted trials, p = 1.03 x
   10(-10). The difference between the distributions of these two subgroups
   was confirmed by comparison of their overall distributions, p = 5.3 x
   10(-15). Each journal exhibited the same abnormal distribution of
   baseline means. There was no difference in distributions of baseline
   means for 1453 trials in non-anaesthetic journals and 3634 trials in
   anaesthetic journals, p = 0.30. The rate of retractions from JAMA and
   NEJM, 6/1453 or 1 in 242, was one-quarter the rate from the six
   anaesthetic journals, 66/3634 or 1 in 55, relative risk (99\%CI) 0.23
   (0.08-0.68), p = 0.00022. A probability threshold of 1 in 10,000
   identified 8/72 (11\%) retracted trials (7 by Fujii et al.) and 82/5015
   (1.6\%) unretracted trials. Some p values were so extreme that the
   baseline data could not be correct: for instance, for 43/5015
   unretracted trials the probability was less than 1 in 10(15) (equivalent
   to one drop of water in 20,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools). A
   probability threshold of 1 in 100 for two or more trials by the same
   author identified three authors of retracted trials (Boldt, Fujii and
   Reuben) and 21 first or corresponding authors of 65 unretracted trials.
   Fraud, unintentional error, correlation, stratified allocation and poor
   methodology might have contributed to the excess of randomised,
   controlled trials with similar or dissimilar means, a pattern that was
   common to all the surveyed journals. It is likely that this work will
   lead to the identification, correction and retraction of hitherto
   unretracted randomised, controlled trials.},

   compared the linguistic style of each paper to a corpus of 253
   unretracted publications and 62 publications retracted for reasons other
   than fraud (e.g., ethics violations). Fraudulent papers were written
   with significantly higher levels of linguistic obfuscation, including
   lower readability and higher rates of jargon than unretracted and
   nonfraudulent papers. We also observed a positive association between
   obfuscation and the number of references per paper, suggesting that
   fraudulent authors obfuscate their reports to mask their deception by
   making them more costly to analyze and evaluate. This is the first
   large-scale analysis of fraudulent papers across authors and disciplines
   to reveal how changes in writing style are related to fraudulent data
   reporting.},

Abstract = {The extent to which a retraction might require revising previous
   scientific estimates and beliefs - which we define as the epistemic cost
   - is unknown. We collected a sample of 229 meta-analyses published
   between 2013 and 2016 that had cited a retracted study, assessed whether
   this study was included in the meta-analytic estimate and, if so,
   re-calculated the summary effect size without it. The majority (68\% of
   N = 229) of retractions had occurred at least one year prior to the
   publication of the citing meta-analysis. In 53\% of these avoidable
   citations, the retracted study was cited as a candidate for inclusion,
   and only in 34\% of these meta-analyses (13\% of total) the study was
   explicitly excluded because it had been retracted. Meta-analyses that
   included retracted studies were published in journals with significantly
   lower impact factor. Summary estimates without the retracted study were
   lower than the original if the retraction was due to issues with data or
   results and higher otherwise, but the effect was small. We conclude that
   meta-analyses have a problematically high probability of citing
   retracted articles and of including them in their pooled summaries, but
   the overall epistemic cost is contained.},

Title = {Retracted papers originating from paper mills: cross sectional study},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {379},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES
   To describe retracted papers originating from paper mills, including
   their characteristics, visibility, and impact over time, and the
   journals in which they were published.
   DESIGN
   Cross sectional study.
   SETTING
   The Retraction Watch database was used for identification of retracted
   papers from paper mills, Web of Science was used for the total number of
   published papers, and data from Journal Citation Reports were collected
   to show characteristics of journals.
   PARTICIPANTS
   All paper mill papers retracted from 1 January 2004 to 26 June 2022 were
   included in the study. Papers bearing an expression of concern were
   excluded.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the sample and analyse
   the trend of retracted paper mill papers over time, and to analyse their
   impact and visibility by reference to the number of citations received.
   RESULTS
   1182 retracted paper mill papers were identified. The publication of the
   first paper mill paper was in 2004 and the first retraction was in 2016;
   by 2021, paper mill retractions accounted for 772 (21.8\%) of the 3544
   total retractions. Overall, retracted paper mill papers were mostly
   published in journals of the second highest Journal Citation Reports
   quartile for impact factor (n=529 (44.8\%)) and listed four to six
   authors (n=602 (50.9\%)). Of the 1182 papers, almost all listed authors
   of 1143 (96.8\%) paper mill retractions came from Chinese institutions
   and 909 (76.9\%) listed a hospital as a primary affiliation. 15 journals
   accounted for 812 (68.7\%) of 1182 paper mill retractions, with one
   journal accounting for 166 (14.0\%). Nearly all (n=1083, 93.8\%) paper
   mill retractions had received at least one citation since publication,
   with a median of 11 (interquartile range 5-22) citations received.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Papers retracted originating from paper mills are increasing in
   frequency, posing a problem for the research community. Retracted paper
   mill papers most commonly originated from China and were published in a
   small number of journals. Nevertheless, detected paper mill papers might
   be substantially different from those that are not detected. New
   mechanisms are needed to identify and avoid this relatively new type of
   misconduct.},

Abstract = {Background As the volume of scientific publications increases, the rate
   of retraction of published papers is also likely to increase. In the
   present study, we report the characteristics of retracted papers from
   clinical neurosurgery and allied clinical and basic science specialties.
   Methods Retracted papers were identified using two separate search
   strategies on PubMed. Attributes of the retracted papers were collected
   from PubMed and the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for
   retraction were analyzed. The factors that correlated with time to
   retraction were identified. Detailed citation analysis for the retracted
   papers was performed. The retraction rates for neurosurgery journals
   were computed. Results A total of 191 retractions were identified; 55\%
   pertained to clinical neurosurgery. The most common reasons for
   retraction were plagiarism, duplication, and compromised peer review.
   The countries associated with the highest number of retractions were
   China, USA, and Japan. The full text of the retraction notice was not
   available for 11\% of the papers. A median of 50\% of all citations
   received by the papers occurredafterretraction. The factors that
   correlated with a longer time to retraction included basic science
   category, the number of collaborating departments, and the H-index of
   the journal. The overall rate of retractions in neurosurgery journals
   was 0.037\%. Conclusions The retraction notice needs to be freely
   available on all search engines. Plagiarism checks and reference checks
   prior to publication of papers (to ensure no retracted papers have been
   cited) must be mandatory. Mandatory data deposition would help overcome
   issues with data and results.},

Title = {Space-time singularities and the theory of retracts},
Journal = {PHYSICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In previous publications, we have started investigating some possible
   applications to the retraction theory in gravitational physics and
   showed that it can be very useful in providing proofs and explaining the
   topological bases. In the current work, we investigate the role of the
   retraction theory in the mathematical study of space-time singularities
   and suggest a topological restriction on the formation of singularities.
   Although we present a toy model using a 5D cosmological metric as an
   example, the current study applies for any collapsing system under the
   influence of gravity such as a massive star or the whole universe. After
   showing that the cosmological space-time M can be retracted into lower
   dimensional circles S-i subset of M, we prove the existence of a
   homotopy between this retraction and the identity map which defines a
   deformation retract on M. Since a circle does not deformation retract
   onto a point but it does retract to a point, the defined deformation
   retract stops any circle Si from retracting into a point which means no
   singularity is formed. The paper underlines the role of algebraic
   topology in the mathematical study of space-time singularities and
   represents a new application of the retraction theory in mathematical
   physics.},

Title = {Can the similarity index predict the causes of retractions in
   high-impact anesthesia journals? A bibliometric analysis},
Journal = {SAUDI JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {S2-8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: The overall similarity index (OSI) and highest similarity
   scores (HSSs) from a single source might help to predict the potential
   reasons for the retraction from the anesthesia journals.
   Methods: Retracted publications, from five highest impact anesthesia
   journals, were retrieved from the MEDLINE and journal archives and
   analyzed using a plagiarism detection software (iThenticate) and
   manually verified for citation characteristics, OSI, HSS, and the
   presence, extent, and location of the duplicate text. The validity of
   the OSI including and excluding quotations and references and the HSS in
   predicting the potential reasons for retraction were tested using the
   receiver operating characteristic curves.
   Results: Of the total 138 retracted original and corresponding articles
   identified, 131 articles were analyzed. Most of them had the HSS more
   than 40\% arising from a single source. Extensive degree of plagiarism
   (OSI score >35\%) was identified through the main text of all analyzed
   retracted articles. The areas under the curves indicate that the OSI
   including and excluding quotations and bibliography and the HSS had
   reasonable ability to predict plagiarism and fabrication with a perfect
   sensitivity rate and low specificity but were weaker at distinguishing
   ethical misconduct or inconsistent or erroneous contents.
   Conclusions: The study highlights the presence of significant plagiarism
   in the retracted anesthesia publications irrespective to the reasons for
   retraction. The high OSI and the HSS could be useful tools to identify
   the potential manuscripts with high risks for plagiarism and
   fabrication.},

Abstract = {Scientific misconduct (fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism) and
   detrimental research practices (selective reporting of data,
   inappropriate citation practice, ghostwriting) are admitted respectively
   by 2 \% and 33 \% of researchers. The consequences of scientific
   misconduct and detrimental research practices are disastrous, both for
   the doctors, who are the most affected researchers in view of the number
   of retracted articles, and for the patients, victims of false
   information that may have health consequences. In order to fight against
   the causes (promotion of doctors and allocation of resources to clinical
   wards and laboratories on purely quantitative research criteria, lack of
   training in scientific integrity in medical studies, heterogenous
   quality of reviewing, legal impunity), there are legislative, academic,
   technological and editorial solutions, but radical and urgent cultural
   change is needed first. (C) 2020 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine

   Based on the communications received from the authors, the editorial
   leadership of Journal of Computational Biology agreed to retract the
   published paper.
   However, after retracting the article, it was also discovered that the
   same article had been previously published in volume 43, issue 6 of the
   journal, Current Problems in Cancer, published by Elsevier. The
   publisher of Journal of Computational Biology was in communication with
   Elseivier since simultaneous submission and/or publication is a
   violation of the proper protocols of peer review, and they are
   conducting their own evaluation. Journal of Computational Biology also
   notified the authors' institution of the infraction.
   Journal of Computational Biology, its Editor, and its Publisher are
   committed to preserving the integrity of the scientific record for the

   This retraction follows an investigation by Jacob-Liebig-University into
   the research conduct of J. Boldt while teaching at the university and
   working at the Hospital of the City of Ludwigshafen. They found multiple
   instances of data irregularity and inconsistency between the data record
   at the university and related publications, leading to an assessment by
   the investigators of systematic unreliability for data in the related
   publications where J. Boldt was the responsible author. Based on the
   findings from their investigation, the Jacob-Liebig-University has
   recommended that journal editors retract all papers where J. Boldt is
   the responsible author.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing amount of research investigating retractions. Yet
   little attention has been paid to the relationship between retractions
   and collaboration. In this paper, we test the hypotheses regarding the
   relationship between retractions and collaboration on a unique
   publication dataset of retractions and its control group constructed by
   the nearest-neighbor-matching approach. Our analysis finds no
   significant evidence indicating that collaboration suffers from
   producing flawed research, at least in the form of retraction. We also
   find that ceteris paribus publications with authors from elite
   universities are less likely but more quickly to be retracted. There
   also is no significant impact of collaboration size on the speed of
   retraction of Chinese articles, although China stands out with the
   fastest retracting speed. Our findings have policy implications for the
   governance of global science, especially that involves collaboration.},

   Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii to be retracted: investigations into
   these three anaesthetists have shown much of their research to be
   unethical or fraudulent. To date, 94\% of their combined papers
   requiring retraction have been retracted; however, only 85\% of the
   retraction notices were compliant with guidelines produced by the
   Committee on Publication Ethics. We contacted the Editors-in-Chief
   and/or publishers of all the journals containing articles that had been
   identified as requiring retraction but had not yet been retracted. In
   response to our enquiries, 16 articles have since been retracted; we
   have documented the journals' responses regarding the remaining papers
   and await further retractions in the future. There is room for
   improvement in the way that unethical or fraudulent papers are handled
   by journals and publishers, beyond the identification of the authors'
   misconduct.},

Title = {Fate of Articles That Warranted Retraction Due to Ethical Concerns: A
   Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Objective: To study journals' responses to a request from the State
   Medical Association of Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, to retract 88 articles
   due to ethical concerns, and to check whether the resulting retractions
   followed published guidelines.
   Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study.
   Population: 88 articles (18 journals) by the anaesthesiologist Dr.
   Boldt, that warranted retraction.
   Method: According to the recommendations of the Committee on Publication
   Ethics, we regarded a retraction as adequate when a retraction notice
   was published, linked to the retracted article, identified the title and
   authors of the retracted article in its heading, explained the reason
   and who took responsibility for the retraction, and when the retracted
   article was freely accessible and marked using a transparent watermark
   that preserved original content. Two authors extracted data
   independently (January 2013) and contacted editors-in-chief and
   publishers for clarification in cases of inadequate retraction.
   Results: Five articles (6\%) fulfilled all criteria for adequate
   retraction. Nine (10\%) were not retracted (no retraction notice
   published, full text article not marked). 79 (90\%) retraction notices
   were published, 76 (86\%) were freely accessible, but only 15 (17\%)
   were complete. 73 (83\%) full text articles were marked as retracted, of
   which 14 (16\%) had an opaque watermark hiding parts of the original
   content, and 11 (13\%) had all original content deleted. 59 (67\%)
   retracted articles were freely accessible. One editor-in-chief stated
   personal problems as a reason for incomplete retractions, eight blamed
   their publishers. Two publishers cited legal threats from Dr. Boldt's
   co-authors which prevented them from retracting articles.
   Conclusion: Guidelines for retracting articles are incompletely
   followed. The role of publishers in the retraction process needs to be
   clarified and standards are needed on marking retracted articles. It
   remains unclear who should check that retractions are done properly.
   Legal safeguards are required to allow retraction of articles against
   the wishes of authors.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {182-198},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Researchers give credit to peer-reviewed, and thus, credible
   publications through citations. Despite a rigorous reviewing process,
   certain articles undergo retraction due to disclosure of their ethical
   or scientific deficiencies. It is, therefore, important to understand
   how society and academia react to the erroneous or deceitful claims and
   purge the science of their unreliable results. Applying a matched-pairs
   research design, this study examined a sample of medicine-related
   retracted and non-retracted articles matched by their content
   similarity. The regression analysis revealed similarities in
   obsolescence trends of the retracted and non-retracted groups. The
   Generalized Estimating Equations showed that citations are affected by
   the retraction status, life after retraction, life cycle and the
   journals' previous reputation, with the two formers being the strongest
   in positively predicting the citations. The retracted papers obtain
   fewer citations either before or after retraction, implying academia's
   watchful reaction to the low-quality papers even before official
   announcement of their fallibility. They exhibit an equal or higher
   social recognition level regarding Tweets and Blog Mentions, while a
   lower status regarding Mendeley Readership. This could signify social
   users' sensibility regarding scientific quality since they probably
   publicise the retraction and warn against the retracted items in their
   tweets or blogs, while avoiding recording them in their Mendeley
   profiles. Further scrutiny is required to gain insight into the
   sensibility, if any, about scientific quality. The study's originality
   relies on matching the retracted and non-retracted papers with their
   topics and neutralising variations in their citation potentials. It is
   also the first study comparing the groups' social impacts.},

Title = {Why articles are retracted: a retrospective cross-sectional study of
   retraction notices at BioMed Central},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Abstract = {Objectives: To assess why articles are retracted from BioMed Central
   journals, whether retraction notices adhered to the Committee on
   Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines, and are becoming more frequent as
   a proportion of published articles.
   Design/setting: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 134
   retractions from January 2000 to December 2015.
   Results: 134 retraction notices were published during this timeframe.
   Although they account for 0.07\% of all articles published (190 514
   excluding supplements, corrections, retractions and commissioned
   content), the rate of retraction is rising. COPE guidelines on
   retraction were adhered to in that an explicit reason for each
   retraction was given. However, some notices did not document who
   retracted the article (eight articles, 6\%) and others were unclear
   whether the underlying cause was honest error or misconduct (15
   articles, 11\%). The largest proportion of notices was issued by the
   authors (47 articles, 35\%). The majority of retractions were due to
   some form of misconduct (102 articles, 76\%), that is, compromised peer
   review (44 articles, 33\%), plagiarism (22 articles, 16\%) and data
   falsification/fabrication (10 articles, 7\%). Honest error accounted for
   17 retractions (13\%) of which 10 articles (7\%) were published in
   error. The median number of days from publication to retraction was
   337.5 days.
   Conclusions: The most common reason to retract was compromised peer
   review. However, the majority of these cases date to March 2015 and
   appear to be the result of a systematic attempt to manipulate peer
   review across several publishers. Retractions due to plagiarism account
   for the second largest category and may be reduced by screening
   manuscripts before publication although this is not guaranteed.
   Retractions due to problems with the data may be reduced by appropriate
   data sharing and deposition before publication. Adopting a checklist
   (linked to COPE guidelines) and templates for various classes of
   retraction notices would increase transparency of retraction notices in
   future.},

Abstract = {We, the authors, Editors and Publisher of the Journal of Drug Targeting

   Wen Lu, Gongqi Chen \& Wenfang Li, Melanin-based biomimic photothermal
   nanoparticles for therapeutic application in diabetic nephropathy
   Journal of Drug Targeting, published online: 02 Nov 2020
   Since publication, the authors have identified key data errors caused by
   incorrect instrument operation. Specifically, the near-infrared (NIR)
   laser, described in the article as having a continuous wavelength of 980
   nm, was found to be operating at 708 nm. Because 708 nm is visible
   light, not NIR, the subsequent data are inaccurate and non-replicable.
   As this directly impacts the validity of the reported results and
   conclusions, the authors alerted the issue to the Editor and Publisher
   and all have agreed to retract the article to ensure the integrity of
   the scholarly record.
   We have been informed in our decision-making by our policy on publishing
   ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on retractions.
   The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly
   record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page as

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-166},
Abstract = {Academic publications are too often ignored by other researchers. There
   are various reasons: Researchers know that conclusions may eventually be
   proved wrong; publications are sometimes retracted; effects may decline
   when studied later; researchers occasionally don't seem to know about
   papers they have allegedly authored; there are even accusations of fraud
   (Cohen, 2011). In this exploratory case study, 10 papers were examined
   to determine the various ways they were used by others, whether there
   were cases of reported effects declining, and whether, among those who
   referenced the papers, there were suggestions that anything in the
   papers ought to be retracted. Findings showed that all the papers had
   been referenced by others (337 user publications were found, containing
   a total of 868 references). Other findings include the following: Single
   references were far more common than multiple references;
   applications/replications were the least common type of usage (23
   occurrences), followed by contrasts/elaborations (34), and quotations
   (65); unlike reports regarding publications in the sciences, whether the
   paper was solo- or co-authored did not affect usage; appearance in a
   non-prestige journal was actually associated with more usage of some
   kinds; and well over 80\% of uses were in heavily scrutinized sources
   (journal articles or theses/dissertations). The paper concludes with
   recommendations to writers about how to avoid producing publications
   that are ignored.},

Title = {Reasons for and time to retraction of genetics articles published
   between 1970 and 2018},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {11},
Pages = {734-740},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Introduction Between 0.02\% and 0.04\% of articles are retracted. We aim
   to: (a) describe the reasons for retraction of genetics articles and the
   time elapsed between the publication of an article and that of the
   retraction notice because of research misconduct (ie, fabrication,
   falsification, plagiarism); and (b) compare all these variables between
   retracted medical genetics (MG) and non-medical genetics (NMG) articles.
   Methods All retracted genetics articles published between 1970 and 2018
   were retrieved from the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for
   retraction were fabrication/falsification, plagiarism, duplication,
   unreliability, and authorship issues. Articles subject to investigation
   by company/institution, journal, US Office for Research Integrity or
   third party were also retrieved.
   Results 1582 retracted genetics articles (MG, n=690; NMG, n=892) were
   identified . Research misconduct and duplication were involved in 33\%
   and 24\% of retracted papers, respectively; 37\% were subject to
   investigation. Only 0.8\% of articles involved both
   fabrication/falsification and plagiarism. In this century the incidence
   of both plagiarism and duplication increased statistically significantly
   in genetics retracted articles; conversely, fabrication/falsification
   was significantly reduced. Time to retraction due to scientific
   misconduct was statistically significantly shorter in the period
   2006-2018 compared with 1970-2000. Fabrication/falsification was
   statistically significantly more common in NMG (28\%) than in MG (19\%)
   articles. MG articles were significantly more frequently investigated
   (45\%) than NMG articles (31\%). Time to retraction of articles due to
   fabrication/falsification was significantly shorter for MG (mean 4.7
   years) than for NMG (mean 6.4 years) articles; no differences for
   plagiarism (mean 2.3 years) were found. The USA (mainly NMG articles)
   and China (mainly MG articles) accounted for the largest number of
   retracted articles.
   Conclusion Genetics is a discipline with a high article retraction rate
   (estimated retraction rate 0.15\%). Fabrication/falsification and
   plagiarism were almost mutually exclusive reasons for article
   retraction. Retracted MG articles were more frequently subject to
   investigation than NMG articles. Retracted articles due to
   fabrication/falsification required 2.0-2.8 times longer to retract than
   when plagiarism was involved.},

   Iran-affiliated Researchers: Revisiting Research Policies and a Key
   Message to Clarivate Analytics},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reasons underlying retractions of papers authored by the Iran-affiliated
   highly cited researchers (HCRs) have not been documented. Here, we
   report that 229 of the Iran-affiliated researchers were listed by the
   Clarivate Analytics as HCRs. We investigated the Retraction Watch
   Database and found that, in total, 51 papers authored by the
   Iran-affiliated HCRs were retracted from 2006 to 2019. Twenty-three of
   the 229 HCRs (10\%) had at least one paper retracted. One of the listed
   HCRs had 22 papers retracted; 14 of the 23 (60.8\%) had only one paper
   retracted. Among the 51 retracted papers, three had been authored by two
   female authors. Eight (16.8\%) retracted papers had international
   co-authorships. The shortest and longest times from publication to
   retraction were 20 and 2610 (mean +/- SD, 857 +/- 616) days,
   respectively. Of the 51 papers, 43 (84\%) had a single reason for
   retraction, whereas eight had multiple reasons. Among the 43 papers, 23
   (53\%) were retracted due to fake peer-review, eight (19\%) were
   duplications, six (14\%) had errors, four (9\%) had plagiarism, and two
   (5\%) were labelled as ``limited or no information.{''} Duplication of
   data, which is easily preventable, amounted to 27\%. Any publishing
   oversight committed by an HCR may not be tolerated because they
   represent the stakeholders of the scientific literature and stand as
   role-models for other peer researchers. Future policies supporting the
   Iranian academia should radically change by implementation of
   educational and awareness programs on publishing ethics to reduce the
   rate of retractions in Iran.},

   namely, the one that may exist between alternative metrics and
   retractions. The research question is as follows: in comparison to
   non-retracted, contemporary publications, are the retracted articles
   likely to be more (or less) viewed and commented (but also << tweeted >>
   and << blogged >>) before the retraction takes place? The above
   relationship is tested on a set ofn = 209 papers retracted by PLoS ONE
   and a control group including 2n = 418 contemporary, non-retracted
   articles featured in the same journal. Significant and positive
   differences in means are found concerning the mentions in peer review
   sites and the number of views and downloads. On the whole, by
   considering five alternative metrics, about one-fourth of the
   retractions are predicted correctly.},

Title = {Risk factors of COVID-19 mortality: a systematic review of current
   literature and lessons from recent retracted articles},
Journal = {EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {24},
Pages = {13089-13097},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the
   association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme
   (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were
   retracted due to significant methodological issues. Therefore, we aimed
   to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method
   and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We
   systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the
   results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in
   two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until
   June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19
   mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers.
   RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and
   clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of
   the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that
   both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with
   macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study
   showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide
   was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95\%
   confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that
   use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was
   associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91).
   CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two
   retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled
   trials and relevant cohort studies. we found out that
   (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of
   mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated
   with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.},

Abstract = {There are three main reasons for retraction: (1) ethical misconduct
   (e.g. duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB,
   ownership issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process,
   citation manipulation); (2) scientific distortion (e.g. data
   manipulation, fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable
   data validity, non-replicability, data errors-even if unintended); (3)
   administrative error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the
   final version published, publisher errors). The first category, although
   highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science,
   the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the
   second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view,
   as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only
   on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal
   characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication,
   years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and
   social media attention by the three major categories. The data set
   comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from
   Elsevier's ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were
   retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine
   post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for
   Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts
   and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction.},

   case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {144},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: The journal received a request to retract a paper reporting
   the results of a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. The
   present and immmediate past editors expand on the journal's decision not
   to retract this paper in spite of undisputable evidence of scientific
   misconduct on behalf of one of the investigators.
   Methods: The editors present an ethical reflection on the request to
   retract this randomized clinical trial with consideration of relevant
   guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and the
   International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) applied to
   the unique contextual issues of this case.
   Results: In this case, scientific misconduct by a blinded provider of a
   homeopathy intervention attempted to undermine the study blind. As part
   of the study, the integrity of the study blind was assessed. Neither
   participants nor homeopaths were able to identify whether the
   participant was assigned to homeopathic medicine or placebo. Central to
   the decision not to retract the paper was the fact that the rigorous
   scientific design provided evidence that the outcome of the study was
   not affected by the misconduct. The misconduct itself was thought to be
   insufficient reason to retract the paper.
   Conclusion: Retracting a paper of which the outcome is still valid was
   in itself considered unethical, as it takes away the opportunity to
   benefit from its results, rendering the whole study useless. In such
   cases, scientific misconduct is better handled through other
   professional channels.},

Title = {What do Retraction Notices Reveal About Institutional Investigations
   into Allegations Underlying Retractions?},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Academic journal publications may be retracted following institutional
   investigations that confirm allegations of research misconduct.
   Retraction notices can provide insight into the role institutional
   investigations play in the decision to retract a publication. Through a
   content analysis of 7,318 retraction notices published between 1927 and
   2019 and indexed by the Web of Science, we found that most retraction
   notices (73.7\%) provided no information about institutional
   investigations that may have led to retractions. A minority of the
   retraction notices (26.3\%) mentioned an institutional investigation
   either by journal authorities (12.1\%), research performing
   organizations (10.3\%), joint institutions (1.9\%), research integrity
   and ethics governing bodies (1.0\%), third-party institutions (0.5\%),
   unspecified institutions (0.4\%), or research funding organizations
   (0.1\%). Comparing retraction notices issued before and after the
   introduction of retraction guidelines by the Committee on Publication
   Ethics (COPE) in 2009 revealed that those published after the
   guidelines' publication were more likely to report investigations by
   journal authorities. Comparing retraction notices from different
   disciplines revealed that those from social sciences and the humanities
   were more likely to disclose investigations by research performing
   organizations than those from biomedical and natural sciences. Based on
   these findings, we suggest that the COPE retraction guidelines in the
   future make it mandatory to disclose in retraction notices institutional
   investigations leading to retractions.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, a multitude of scientific publications on health science are
   being developed that require correct bibliographic search in order to
   avoid the use and inclusion of retracted literature in them. The use of
   these articles could directly affect the consistency of the scientific
   studies and could affect clinical practice. The aim of the present study
   was to evaluate the capacity of the main scientific literature search
   engines, both general (Gooogle Scholar) and scientific (PubMed, EMBASE,
   SCOPUS, and Web of Science), used in health sciences in order to check
   their ability to detect and warn users of retracted articles in the
   searches carried out. The sample of retracted articles was obtained from
   RetractionWatch. The results showed that although Google Scholar was the
   search engine with the highest capacity to retrieve selected articles,
   it was the least effective, compared with scientific search engines, at
   providing information on the retraction of articles. The use of
   different scientific search engines to retrieve as many scientific
   articles as possible, as well as never using only a generic search
   engine, is highly recommended. This will reduce the possibility of
   including retracted articles and will avoid affecting the reliability of
   the scientific studies carried out.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study examines the extent to which retracted articles
   pertaining to COVID-19 have been shared via social and mass media based
   on altmetric scores. Methods: Seventy-one retracted articles related to
   COVID-19 were identified from relevant databases, of which thirty-nine
   had an Altmetric Attention Score obtained using the Altmetrics
   Bookmarklet. Data extracted from the articles include overall attention
   score and demographics of sharers (e.g., geographic location,
   professional affiliation). Results: Retracted articles related to
   COVID-19 were shared tens of thousands of times to an audience of
   potentially hundreds of millions of readers and followers. Twitter was
   the largest medium for sharing these articles, and the United States was
   the country with the most sharers. While general members of the public
   were the largest proportion of sharers, researchers and professionals
   were not immune to sharing these articles on social media and on
   websites, blogs, or news media. Conclusions: These findings have
   potential implications for better understanding the spread of misleading
   or false information perpetuated in retracted scholarly publications.
   They emphasize the importance of quality peer review and research ethics
   among journals and responsibility among individuals who wish to share
   research findings.},

   retraction of published articles involving human research participants:
   a literature survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {39-47},
Abstract = {Aim: Article retraction is a measure taken by journals or authors where
   there is evidence of research misconduct or error, redundancy,
   plagiarism or unethical research. Recently, the retraction of scientific
   publications has been on the rise. In this survey, we aimed to describe
   the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles and the
   reasons for retractions.
   Methods: We searched retracted articles on the PubMed database and
   Retraction Watch website from 1980 to February 2016. The primary
   outcomes were the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles
   and the reasons for retractions. The secondary outcomes included how
   article retractions were handled by journals and how to improve the
   journal practices toward article retractions.
   Results: We included 1,339 retracted articles. Most retracted articles
   had six authors or fewer. Article retraction was most common in the USA
   (26\%), Japan (11\%) and Germany (10\%). The main reasons for article
   retraction were misconduct (51\%, n = 685) and error (14\%, n = 193).
   There were 66\% (n = 889) of retracted articles having male senior or
   corresponding authors. Of the articles retracted after August 2010, 63\%
   (n = 567) retractions were reported on Retraction Watch. Large
   discrepancies were observed in the ways that different journals handled
   article retractions. For instance, articles were completely withdrawn
   from some journals, while in others, articles were still available with
   no indication of retraction. Likewise, some retraction notices included
   a detailed account of the events that led to article retraction, while
   others only consisted of a statement indicating the article retraction.
   Conclusion: The characteristics, geographic distribution and reasons for
   retraction of published articles involving human research participants
   were examined in this survey. More efforts are needed to improve the
   consistency and transparency of journal practices toward article
   retractions.},

   analysis was carried out using Mann-Whitney U test. A total of 83
   articles were selected for the analysis between 1994 and 2019. Articles
   were retracted after a median of 1 year (IQR 4.0), and 55 (66.3\%)
   articles were published in the year 2010 or after. Results Forty-eight
   (57.8\%) articles were original articles. The most common subspecialties
   involved were basic science (51.8\%), followed by vitreoretinal diseases
   (13.3\%) and cornea and external diseases (7.1\%). Fraudulent data were
   the cause of retraction in 22 (26.5\%) articles, and 14 articles
   (16.87\%) were retracted because of plagiarism. Thirteen articles
   (15.7\%) were retracted due to errors in the data calculations, and ten
   (12.04\%) were found to be duplicate submissions of previously published
   articles by the same author, while five articles (6.02\%) had authorship
   disputes. Thirty-nine (46.9\%) retracted articles were published in a
   journal with an impact factor greater than 2. The median number of
   citations received by the retracted articles was 2.0 (IQR 9.0).
   Conclusions We conclude that the number of retractions in the ophthalmic
   literature have increased since 2010, though relatively limited
   information is available on the retracted articles. There is a need to
   strictly follow the current guidelines for providing the reasons for
   retraction and displaying retraction notices both in PubMed and on the
   journal websites.},

Abstract = {During the past few decades, the rate of publication retractions has
   increased dramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate
   retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two
   fundamental questions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly
   impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this
   influence propagate to the wider academic community through scholarly
   associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of retracted articles
   indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran multiple
   experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set
   of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied
   the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific
   topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within
   those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly
   impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after
   retraction, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with
   retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second,
   this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader
   scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect.
   Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science
   committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or
   institutions related to retractions.},

Abstract = {In a publication that appeared in 2005 (Diem et al., Mutat. Res.
   583:178-183){[}10] harmful effects (DNA breakage) were reported to occur
   in rat and human cells after exposure to mobile-phone electromagnetic
   fields. The extremely low standard deviations in this paper, and in
   another publication by the same group of authors, prompted Vijayalaxmi
   to write a critical comment {[}Mutat. Res. 603 (2006)104-1061]{[}6]. An
   investigation by the Medical University of Vienna (Austria) was
   initiated by a letter by the first author of the present paper, based on
   the data contained in the reply by the authors {[}Riidiger et al.,
   Mutat. Res. 603 (2006)107-109]{[}17]. The University published three
   press releases, stating that ``the data were not measured
   experimentally, but fabricated{''} and that the Mutation Research paper
   and another, published by the International Archives of Occupational and
   Environmental Health (IAOEH) in 2008, should be retracted. So far,
   neither of these papers has been retracted. Only a Letter of Concern by
   the Editors of IAOEH, and an Editorial by Mutation Research were
   published. Here we describe the statistical methods used to identify the
   evidence of data fabrication. The major point is the small variation in
   the reported data, which is below the theoretical lower limit derived
   from multinomial distributions and also lower than those derived from
   detailed simulations. Another reason for doubt was the highly
   significant non-equal distribution of last digits, a known hint towards
   data fabrication. In view of the results of the University's
   investigation and the evidence presented in this paper, the Diem et al.
   (2005) {[}10] publication should be retracted, with or without the
   authors' agreement. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Inconsistent and incomplete retraction of published research: A
   cross-sectional study on Covid-19 retractions and recommendations to
   mitigate risks for research, policy and practice},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {Background
   Retraction of published research can reduce the dissemination of
   incorrect or misleading information, but concerns have been raised about
   the clarity and rigor of the retraction process. Failure to clearly and
   consistently retract research has several risks, for example discredited
   or erroneous research may inform health research studies (e.g. clinical
   trials), policies and practices, potentially rendering these unreliable.
   Objective
   To investigate consistency and clarity of research retraction, based on
   a case study of retracted Covid-19 research.
   Study design
   A cross-sectional study of retracted Covid-19 articles reporting
   empirical research findings, based on searches of Medline, Embase and
   Scopus on 10th July and 19th December 2020.
   Key results
   We included 46 retracted Covid-19 articles. The number eligible for
   inclusion nearly doubled, from 26 to 46, in five months. Most articles
   (67\%) were retracted from scientific journals and the remainder from
   preprint servers. Key findings: (1) reasons for retraction were not
   reported in 33\% (15/46) of cases; (2) time from publication to
   retraction could not be determined in 43\% (20/46) of cases; (3) More
   than half (59\%) of retracted Covid-19 articles (27/46) remained
   available as original unmarked electronic documents after retraction
   (33\% as full text and 26\% as an abstract only). Sources of articles
   post-retraction were preprint servers, ResearchGate and, less commonly,
   websites including PubMed Central and the World Health Organization. A
   retracted journal article which controversially claimed a link between
   5G technology and Covid-19 remains available in its original full text
   from at least 60 different websites.
   Conclusions
   The retraction process is inconsistent and often ambiguous, with more
   than half of retracted Covid-19 research articles remaining available,
   unmarked, from a wide range of online sources. There is an urgent need
   to improve guidance on the retraction process and to extend this to
   cover preprint servers. We provide structured recommendations to address
   these concerns and to reduce the risks that arise when retracted
   research is inappropriately cited.},

Abstract = {Methodological mistakes, data errors, and scientific misconduct are
   considered prevalent problems in science that are often difficult to
   detect. In this study, we explore the potential of Twitter for
   discovering these problems with publications. We analyzed tweet texts of
   three retracted publications about COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease
   2019)/SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and
   their retraction notices. We did not find early warning signs in tweet
   texts regarding one publication, but we did find tweets that casted
   doubt on the validity of the two other publications shortly after their
   publication date. An extension of our current work might lead to an
   early warning system (based on Twitter data) that makes the scientific
   community aware of problems with certain publications. Other sources,
   such as blogs or post-publication peer review sites, could be included
   in such an early warning system.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a surge of
   publications seeking to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A byproduct of
   the rush to understand COVID-19 has been the publication and subsequent
   retraction of papers promoting unfounded treatments, such as
   ivermectin-an anti-parasitic medication. This study aims to determine
   the impact retracted studies may have had on ivermectin prescription
   rates. TriNetX was used to gather anonymized patient data from 67
   healthcare organizations both within the USA (36,711 patients; 91.6\%)
   and abroad (3,266 patients; 8.14\%) to obtain prescribing rates for
   ivermectin between April 2020-September 2022. Google Trends was used to
   gauge online interest in purchasing ivermectin in relation to
   prescribing rates. We found that ivermectin use largely increased
   following periods in which later-retracted journal articles were written
   touting its potential benefits. Multiple spikes in Google searches were
   observed, with the first three local peaks occurring within the first,
   second, and third publication `clusters,' respectively. The maximum peak
   for searches occurred just one month after the maximum number of
   ivermectin prescriptions. This information is important for
   understanding how health-related misinformation spreads, and how to best
   minimize and counteract the impact of such misinformation in the future.},

Title = {Surveying Retracted Studies and Notices Within the Field of Radiation
   Oncology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to characterize retracted studies
   within the field of radiation oncology.
   Methods and Materials: Computerized searches were performed in Ovid
   MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2017
   looking for retracted studies using the terms ``retraction note,{''}
   ``retracted note,{''} ``withdrawn{''} and ``radiotherapy,{''} and
   ``radiation oncology.{''} Additional studies were identified by
   hand-searching 10 discipline-specific journals. Two authors
   independently screened papers and then extracted author demographics,
   journal characteristics, and retraction-specific variables.
   Results: Of the 58 studies identified, the most common reasons for
   retraction were misconduct (43\%), methodological error (21\%),
   authorship issues (5\%), unknown causes (5\%), and journal
   (administrative) errors (3\%). A total of 13 systematic reviews or
   protocols (22\%) were withdrawn from the Cochrane Library for being
   out-of-date or redundant. All but one retracted study and retraction
   notice were available in portable document format. Of the 57 retrieved
   papers, 79\% were identified as retracted via in-text notations or
   watermarks. Overall median time to retraction was 44 months
   (interquartile range, 11-98 months). However, 42 studies (72\%) were
   still cited after retraction notices were published.
   Conclusions: A retracted study within the field of radiation oncology
   remains a relatively uncommon event. Although promising, our data
   suggest that the majority of these retracted articles continue to be
   cited as valid research. As such, there is still a need for clinicians
   to remain vigilant with their academic rigor and good clinical research
   practices. There is an urgent need for publication houses to foster
   universal publishing standards along with discipline-specific retraction
   guidelines. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {Authorship Issues When Articles are Retracted Due to Research Misconduct
   and Then Resubmitted},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the last 20 years, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence
   of retractions of articles published in scientific journals, the
   majority of which are due to research misconduct. In some cases,
   researchers have revised and republished articles that were retracted
   due to misconduct, which raises some novel questions concerning
   authorship. Suppose that an article is retracted because one of the
   authors fabricated or falsified some data, but the researchers decide to
   salvage the useable data, make appropriate revisions, and resubmit the
   article for publication. If the person who committed misconduct has made
   a significant contribution to the research reported in the revised
   paper, should they be named as an author to recognize this contribution
   or should they be denied authorship because they committed misconduct?
   This is a challenging issue because it involves the confluence of two
   research ethics domains that are usually dealt with separately, i.e.,
   resolution of authorship disputes and adjudication of misconduct
   findings, as well as potential conflicts among norms that underlie
   authorship practices and misconduct adjudication. In this paper, we (1)
   describe some actual cases involving articles that were retracted for
   misconduct and republished; (2) review policies from the International
   Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Committee on Publication Ethics,
   and top fifteen biomedical journals to determine whether they provide
   adequate guidance for cases like these; and (3) analyze the ethical and
   policy issues that may arise in these situations.},

Abstract = {While researchers with retracted papers - publications that are
   withdrawn because of significant errors or scientific misconduct - carry
   a permanent stain on their publishing records, understanding the causes
   and initiators of such retractions can shed a different light on the
   matter. This paper, based on a random sample of 2,046 retracted papers,
   which were published between 1975 and 2019, extracted from Retraction
   Watch and the websites of major publishers, shows that 53\% of the
   retraction notices do not specify who initiated the retraction. Nearly
   10\% of the retraction notes either omit or do not contain information
   related to reasons for retractions. Furthermore, most of the retracted
   papers in our sample have no limitation section; those who do are
   commonly unhelpful or irrelevant. The results carry three implications
   for scientific transparency: retraction notices need to be more
   informative; limitation sections ought to be a required and even an open
   section of all published articles; and finally, promoting `heroic acts'
   in science can positively change the current publishing culture.},

Title = {Standard quality criteria in retracted vs nonretracted obstetrical
   randomized controlled trials},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS \& GYNECOLOGY MFM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of retracted articles in peer-reviewed journals
   is increasing within the field of obstetrics. The most common rea-son
   for article retraction is scientific misconduct. Unfortunately, article
   retraction often occurs years after publication, allowing inaccurate
   data to be widely distributed to readers. There exists a great need for
   validated screening criteria for obstetric journals to use when
   reviewing randomized controlled trials for scientific
   misconduct.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare retracted obstetric
   random-ized controlled trials with nonretracted randomized controlled
   trials with regard to their inclusion of 7 quality metrics: prospective
   trial registration, trial registration number, ethics approval
   statement, name of the approving committee, statement of informed
   consent, adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
   guidelines, and a data sharing statement.STUDY DESIGN: Obstetric
   randomized controlled trials retracted between 1995 and 2021 identified
   through Retraction Watch were com-pared with nonretracted randomized
   controlled trials published between 2018 and 2020 with regard to
   inclusion of the 7 quality metrics. The main outcome was the difference
   in prospective trial registration. Secondary outcomes were the
   percentage of individual criteria met and the screening performance of
   quality criteria in predicting article retraction.RESULTS: A total of
   150 randomized controlled trials were identified, of which 14 (9.3\%)
   were retracted and 136 (90.7\%) nonretracted. Retracted randomized
   controlled trials were less likely than nonretracted randomized
   controlled trials to be prospectively registered (14.3\% vs 80.1\%;
   P<.001). The median number of quality criteria met was lower for
   retracted randomized controlled trials (3 vs 6; P<.01). Using a cutoff
   of <= 4 criteria granted 85.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 57.2-98.2)
   sensi-tivity and 92.0\% (95\% confidence interval, 86.2-96.0)
   specificity in dis-tinguishing the retracted randomized controlled
   trials from nonretracted studies.CONCLUSION: Retracted obstetric
   randomized controlled trials were less likely to include the 7 quality
   metrics required on submission by most top obstetrics and gynecology
   journals.},

Title = {Correcting duplicate publications: follow up study of MEDLINE tagged
   duplications},
Journal = {BIOCHEMIA MEDICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction: As MEDLINE indexers tag similar articles as duplicates
   even when journals have not addressed the duplication(s), we sought to
   determine the reasons behind the tagged duplications, and if the
   journals had undertaken or had planned to undertake any actions to
   address them.
   Materials and methods: On 16 January 2013, we extracted all tagged
   duplicate publications (DPs), analysed published notices, and then
   contacted MEDLINE and editors regarding cases unaddressed by notices.
   For non-respondents, we compared full text of the articles. We followed
   up the study for the next 5 years to see if any changes occurred.
   Results: We found 1011 indexed DPs, which represented 555 possible DP
   cases (in MEDLINE, both the original and the duplicate are assigned a DP
   tag). Six cases were excluded as we could not obtain their full text.
   Additional 190 (35\%) cases were incorrectly tagged as DPs. Of 359
   actual cases of DPs, 200 (54\%) were due to publishers' actions (e.g.
   identical publications in the same journal), and 159 (46\%) due to
   authors' actions (e.g. article submission to more than one journal). Of
   the 359 cases, 185 (52\%) were addressed by notices, but only 25 (7\%)
   retracted. Following our notifications, MEDLINE corrected 138 (73\%)
   incorrectly tagged cases, and editors retracted 8 articles.
   Conclusions: Despite clear policies on how to handle DPs, just half
   (54\%) of the DPs in MEDLINE were addressed by journals and only 9\%
   retracted. Publishers, editors, and indexers need to develop and
   implement standards for better correction of duplicate published
   records.},

Title = {The impact of misconduct on the published medical and non-medical

Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Pages = {573-587},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Better understanding of research and publishing misconduct can improve
   strategies to mitigate their occurrence. In this study, we examine
   various trends among 2,375 articles retracted due to misconduct in all
   scholarly fields. Proportions of articles retracted due to ``publication
   misconduct{''} (primarily plagiarism and duplicate publication) or
   ``distrust data or interpretations{''} (primarily research artifacts and
   unexplained irreproducibility of data) differ significantly between
   PubMed (35 and 59 \%, respectively) and non-PubMed (56 and 27 \%)
   articles and between English- and non-English-speaking author
   affiliation countries. Retraction rates due to any form of misconduct,
   adjusted for the size of the literature in different disciplines, vary
   from 0.22 per 100,000 articles in the Humanities to 7.58 in Medicine and
   7.69 in Chemistry. The annual rate of article retractions due to
   misconduct has increased exponentially since 2001, and the percentage of
   all retractions involving misconduct allegations has grown from
   18.5-29.2 \% for each year from 1990-1993 to 55.8-71.9 \% for each year
   from 2007-2010. Despite these increases, the prominence of research
   integrity in the news media has not changed appreciably over the past 20
   years. Articles retracted due to misconduct are found in all major
   scholarly disciplines. The higher rate of plagiarism among authors from
   non-English speaking countries may diminish if institutions improved
   their support for the writing of English manuscripts by their scholars.
   The training of junior scholars on proper codes of research (and
   publishing) conduct should be embraced by all disciplines, not just by
   biomedical fields where the perception of misconduct is high.},

Abstract = {The field of oncology is the main field in medicine with a high rate of
   retraction. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the
   trends of retracted publications in oncology, evaluating their
   bibliographic characteristics and the reasons for the retraction of
   articles. The research was conducted specifically using a scientometric
   approach and relying on scientific visualization techniques, where
   Bibliometrix R Package Software was used to analyze the data. The
   present research results imply that the number of retracted articles in
   oncology has increased since 1995. Moreover, the results reveal that
   China, the United States (US), Japan, Iran, and Italy are the countries
   in which the number of such articles compared to all other countries is
   the largest. Analysis of topics covered in such articles shows that the
   majority of retracted articles in oncology have been associated with
   apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, migration, colorectal cancer, lung
   cancer, and breast cancer, and were found most abundantly in two
   journals: Tumor Biology and Cancer Research. The principal reasons for
   retractions were: Investigation by Journal/Publisher, Duplication of
   Image, Fake Peer Review, Investigation by Company/Institution, and
   Concerns/Issues About Data. Reviewing the reasons why articles have been
   retracted is important information for editors and editorial boards of
   oncology journals, related researchers, and policymakers in this field,
   which could prevent effectively similar events and their adverse
   consequences in the future.},

Abstract = {In forestry, the Pterocarpus genus is important for the wood industry as
   this is a tree that is highly valued for its timber. Biotechnological
   research on this tree genus therefore needs to be carefully examined,
   even at the post-publication stage. In this paper, we examine how a
   near-duplicate copy of a 2004 paper published in a leading plant science
   and biotechnology Springer Nature journal, In Vitro Cellular and
   Developmental Biology-Plant, was corrected, rather than retracted. The
   near-duplicate paper has been cited a total of 16 times, according to
   the Web of Science, and since 2015, when the paper was first corrected,
   four citations have emerged. These additional citations for the
   corrected paper support our claim that the corrected paper should have
   been retracted, i.e., that the literature was insufficiently corrected,
   which may have prevented the citation of this near-duplicate paper.
   Readers who cited the near-duplicate paper after the erratum had been
   published were either unaware of the correction, or ignored it.
   Post-publication peer review needs to be more integrated into the
   publishing framework. We suggest a corrective mechanism by Clarivate
   Analytics to correct the journal impact factor to avoid citation
   inflation.},

Abstract = {Retraction of scholarly publications ensures that unqualified knowledge
   is purged from the scientific community. However, there appears to be
   little understanding about how this is practiced among library and
   information science (LIS) journals. Hence, this study investigated the
   correction and retraction practices of LIS journals. Journals included
   in the Web of Science's information science and library science subject
   category were selected for the study and the characteristics of the
   articles corrected or retracted in those journals between 1996 and 2016
   were examined. Findings show that there were 517 corrections and five
   retractions in LIS journals during the period. Most of the corrections
   made to articles in LIS journals were minor while the reasons for
   article retraction included plagiarism, duplication, irreproducible
   results and methodological errors. Our findings also reveal that on
   average it took about 587 days for an article to be retracted while some
   of the retracted articles continued to be cited after retraction. The
   study concluded that the average number of errors per correction was
   lower than what had been observed in medical journals while some of the
   retracted articles continued to receive positive post-retraction
   citations. It also recommended the inclusion of a check on the validity
   of literature cited by authors at the review stage as part of the
   quality control mechanism by publishers of LIS journals.},

Title = {Against the use and publication of contemporary unethical research: the

Abstract = {Recent calls for retraction of a large body of Chinese transplant
   research and of Dr Jiankui He's gene editing research has led to renewed
   interest in the question of publication, retraction and use of unethical
   biomedical research. In Part 1 of this paper, we briefly review the now
   well-established consequentialist and deontological arguments for and
   against the use of unethical research. We argue that, while there are
   potentially compelling justifications for use under some circumstances,
   these justifications fail when unethical practices are ongoing-as in the
   case of research involving transplantations in which organs have been
   procured unethically from executed prisoners. Use of such research
   displays a lack of respect and concern for the victims and undermines
   efforts to deter unethical practices. Such use also creates moral taint
   and renders those who use the research complicit in continuing harm. In
   Part 2, we distinguish three dimensions of `non-use' of unethical
   research: non-use of published unethical research, non-publication, and
   retraction and argue that all three types of non-use should be upheld in
   the case of Chinese transplant research. Publishers have
   responsibilities to not publish contemporary unethical biomedical
   research, and where this has occurred, to retract publications. Failure
   to retract the papers implicitly condones the research, while uptake of
   the research through citations rewards researchers and ongoing
   circulation of the data in the literature facilitates subsequent use by
   researchers, policymakers and clinicians.},

Title = {Retraction of publications in nursing and midwifery research: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {8-13},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Rates of manuscript retraction in academic journals are
   increasing. Papers are retracted because of scientific misconduct or
   serious error. To date there have been no studies that have examined
   rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery journals.
   Design: A systematic review of Journal Citation Report listed nursing
   science journals.
   Data sources: The Medline database was searched systematically from
   January 1980 through July 2017, and www.retractionwatch.com was manually
   searched for relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria.
   Review methods: Two researchers undertook title and abstract and full
   text screening. Data were extracted on the country of the corresponding
   author, journal title, impact factor, study design, year of retraction,
   number of citations after retraction, and reason for retraction.
   Journals retraction index was also calculated.
   Results: Twenty-nine retracted papers published in nursing science
   journals were identified, the first in 2007. This represents 0.029\% of
   all papers published in these journals since 2007. We observed a
   significant increase in the retraction rate of 0.44 per 10,000
   publications per year (95\% CI; 0.03-0.84, p=.037). There was a negative
   association between a journal's retraction index and impact factor with
   a significant reduction in retraction index of -0.57 for a one-point
   increase in impact factor (95\% CI;-1.05 to -0.09, p=.022). Duplicate
   publication was the most common reason for retraction (n=18, 58\%). The
   mean number of citations manuscripts received after retraction was
   seven, the highest was 52. Most (n=27, 93.1\%) of the retracted papers
   are still available online (with a watermark indicating they are
   retracted).
   Conclusion: Compared to more established academic disciplines, rates of
   retraction in nursing and midwifery are low. Findings suggest that
   unsound research is not being identified and that the checks and
   balances incumbent in the scientific method are not working. In a
   clinical discipline, this is concerning and may indicate that research
   that should have been removed from the evidence base continues to
   influence nursing and midwifery care.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on retraction notices from two major Latin
   American/Caribbean indexing databases: SciELO and LILACS. SciELO
   includes open scientific journals published mostly in Latin America/the
   Caribbean, from which 10 \% are also indexed by Thomson Reuters Web of
   Knowledge Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). LILACS has a similar
   geographical coverage and includes dissertations and conference/symposia
   proceedings, but it is limited to publications in the health sciences. A
   search for retraction notices was performed in these two databases using
   the keywords ``retracted{''}, ``retraction{''} ``withdrawal{''},
   ``withdrawn{''}, ``removed{''} and ``redress{''}. Documents were
   manually checked to identify those that actually referred to
   retractions, which were then analyzed and categorized according to the
   reasons alleged in the notices. Dates of publication/retraction and time
   to retraction were also recorded. Searching procedures were performed
   between June and December 2014. Thirty-one retraction notices were
   identified, fifteen of which were in JCR-indexed journals.
   ``Plagiarism{''} was alleged in six retractions of this group. Among the
   non-JCR journals, retraction reasons were alleged in fourteen cases,
   twelve of which were attributed to ``plagiarism{''}. The proportion of
   retracted articles for the SciELO database was approximately 0.005 \%.
   The reasons alleged in retraction notices may be used as signposts to
   inform discussions in Latin America on plagiarism and research
   integrity. At the international level, these results suggest that the
   correction of the literature is becoming global and is not limited to
   mainstream international publications.},

Abstract = {Editorial Boards of mainstream journals occasionally face ethical
   misconducts in received manuscripts. The Committee on Publication Ethics
   (COPE) provides recommendations for editors on how to deal with
   suspected ethical misconduct in either received or published
   manuscripts. The manuscript is rejected when malpractice is observed
   during the peer review process, however, if the misconduct is detected
   after the publication, the publication will be retracted. The Revista
   Chilena de Pediatria (Chilean Journal of Pediatrics) has not been exempt
   from these type of conflicts. In this article, we analyze different
   aspects regarding the lack of integrity in publications, such as
   authorship, plagiarism, and conflict of interest. We can conclude that
   malpractices take place mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the
   authors rather than intent to defraud. It is expected that this article
   will succeed in instructing and sensitizing our researchers on good
   practices in research and publication, and contribute, as far as
   possible, to prevent this actions in the manuscripts sent to our
   Journal.},

Title = {Review of retracted papers in the field of neurology},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 9},
Abstract = {Background and purpose: Despite the growing awareness of academic fraud,
   its prevalence in the field of neurology has not been fully assessed.
   This review aims to analyze the characteristics of the retracted papers
   in the field of neurology and the reasons for the retraction to better
   understand the trends in this area and to assist to avoid retraction
   incidents.Methods: A total of 79 papers were included, which pertained
   to 22 countries and 64 journals. The marking methods for retracting
   original papers included watermarks (89.04\%), retracted signs in the
   text (5.48\%) and no prompt (5.48\%). The median M (interquartile range
   {[}IQR]) of citations in retractions in neurology was 7 (41). Studies
   continued to be cited after retraction with an M (IQR) of 3 (16). The
   journal impact factor was between 0 and 157.335, with an M (IQR) of
   5.127 (3.668). 45.21\% and 31.51\% papers were mainly published in the
   first and second quartile journals, respectively. The M (IQR) time
   elapsed between publication and retraction was 32 (44) months. The
   reasons for retraction included two major categories, academic
   misconduct (79.75\%) and academic unintentional mistakes
   (20.25\%).Results and conclusions: The number of retractions in
   neurology has been on the rise over the past decade, with fabricated
   academic misconduct being the main cause of the retractions. Due to the
   long time lag between publication and retraction, a number of unreliable
   findings continue to be cited following retraction. In addition to the
   requisite standards of academic ethics, augmenting research training and
   fostering interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in enhancing
   research integrity.},

   retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editors in
   Chief, Michelle De Haan and Charles Nelson and John Wiley \& Sons

   by the first author, N. Mahajan, was inaccurate and did not reflect the
   looking times found by other trained coders. A reanalysis of the data
   reported in this paper failed to verify the reported effects, and thus
   the authors have requested that the publication be retracted. Ms.
   Mahajan takes sole responsibility for the inaccurate coding. An

   Mahajan. All authors of the original publication joined in the request

Abstract = {The present study aims to find out the origin of authors and the main
   sources in which citing documents of Wakefield's 1998 retracted article
   are published in order to understand whether they act as promoters of a
   negative domino effect, there is, keeping alive a retracted article due
   to fraudulent data and analysis on the relationship between MMR
   (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine and autism. The metadata of the
   1577 citing documents of Wakefield's article were downloaded from Scopus
   in three files according to the year of publication: 1998-2004 (partial
   retraction), 2005-2010 (in between partial and full retraction) and
   2011-2020 (post full retraction). The number of citing documents in each
   period is 329, 411 and 837, respectively. A comparison between first and
   last periods indicates an impressive growth of language, authors,
   countries as well as journals from broader field coverage. Also, recent
   citing articles are highly cited and, even in a negative context, they
   contribute to the diffusion of a fraudulent article in the science
   context. The findings reinforce the urgency to create internal
   strategies in the scientific communication process, mainly inside the
   editorial flow, in order to reduce the dissemination of a retracted
   article that, in this case, is still harmful to society. At the end, the
   creation of an automatic mechanism to detect retracted articles included
   in the reference list of accepted articles is suggested.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Retractions are necessary to remove flawed research from citable
   literature but cannot offset the negative impact those publications have
   on science advances and public trust. The editorial peerreview process
   is intended to prevent flawed research from being published. However,
   there is limited empirical evidence of its effectiveness in identifying
   issues that lead to retractions. This study analyzed the peer-review
   comments (provided by Clarivate Analytics) for a sample of retracted
   publications (provided by Retraction Watch) to investigate how the
   peer-review process effectively detects the areas where the retraction
   causes lie and whether reviewer characteristics are related to the
   effectiveness. We found that a small proportion of peer reviews
   suggested rejections during the peer review stage, while about half
   suggested acceptance or minor revision for those later retracted papers.
   The peer-review process was more effective in identifying retraction
   causes related to data, methods, and results than those related to text
   plagiarism and references. Additionally, factors such as reviewer
   seniority and the level of match between reviewers' expertise and the
   submission were significant in determining the possibility of peer
   reviews identifying suspicious areas in submissions. We discussed
   potential insights from these findings and called for collective efforts
   to prevent retractions.},

Title = {Research misconduct, retraction, and cleansing the medical literature:
   Lessons from the Poehlman case},

Abstract = {The scientific literature is a record of the search for truth.
   Publication of faked data diverts this search. The scientific community
   has a duty to warn people to ignore an article containing faked data and
   must try to prevent inadvertent citation of it. The scientific community
   accomplishes these tasks by publishing a retraction and linking it to
   the fraudulent article's citation in electronic indexes of the medical
   literature, such as PubMed. This mechanism is far from perfect, as shown
   by a case history of scientific fraud perpetrated by Eric Poehlman, PhD.
   His institution notified 3 journals that they had published tainted
   articles. Two journals failed to retract. The third journal retracted
   immediately, but other authors continued to cite the retracted article.
   Another duty of the scientific community is to verify the integrity of
   other articles published by the author of a fraudulent article. This
   task falls to the author's institution and requires coauthors to vouch
   for their article's integrity by convincing institutional investigators
   that the suspect author could not have altered the raw scientific data
   from their study. Two universities are currently investigating
   PoehIman's published research.
   Maintaining the integrity of the scientific literature requires
   governmental institutions that have the authority to investigate and
   punish guilty scientists and requires that research institutions
   investigate alleged fraud. It requires journal editors to issue a
   retraction when they learn that their journal has published a tainted
   article. It requires research institutions to accept their
   responsibility to investigate every article published by a scientist who
   has published even 1 fraudulent article. Finally, it requires authors to
   take pains to avoid citing retracted articles and to issue a correction
   when they inadvertently cite a retracted article.},

Abstract = {This study analyses scientific fraud in the European Union by examining
   retractions due to Falsification, Fabrication and Plagiarism (FFP) where
   at least one researcher is affiliated to an EU member country. The
   information on publications retracted due to FFP is based on the records
   in the Retraction Watch Database up to 31/05/2020 and they are also
   reviewed in Web of Science. A total of 662 retractions due to FFP were
   obtained, corresponding to 24.46\% of all retractions in the EU. Germany
   is first in the European ranking for FFP, Holland in the ranking for FF,
   and Italy in that for Plagiarism. 60.83\% of the articles retracted due
   to FFP are from the Life Science and Biomedicine field. More than 75\%
   of the articles have been published in journals that form part of the
   JCR and have an impact factor. There is also extensive citation of the
   retracted documents. Misconduct due to FFP causes a significant loss of
   resources and reputation, with severe effects for the authors,
   publishers, and institutions. It is recommended that the EU continue to
   apply policies and guidelines to harmonise criteria in relation to FFP,
   as well as to prevent and avoid scientific misconduct.},

Abstract = {In the management academic research, academic advancement, job security,
   and the securing of research funds at one's university are judged mainly
   by one's output of publications in high impact journals. With bogus
   resumes filled with published journal articles, universities and other
   allied institutions are keen to recruit or sustain the appointment of
   such academics. This often places undue pressure on aspiring academics
   and on those already recruited to engage in research misconduct which
   often leads to research integrity. This structured review focuses on the
   ethics and integrity of management research through an analysis of
   retracted articles published from 2005 to 2016. The study employs a
   structured literature review methodology whereby retracted articles
   published between 2005 and 2016 in the field of management science were
   found using Crossref and Google Scholar. The searched articles were then
   streamlined by selecting articles based on their relevance and content
   in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Based on the analysed
   retracted articles, the study shows evidence of ethical misconduct among
   researchers of management science. Such misconduct includes data
   falsification, the duplication of submitted articles, plagiarism, data
   irregularity and incomplete citation practices. Interestingly, the
   analysed results indicate that the field of knowledge management
   includes the highest number of retracted articles, with plagiarism
   constituting the most significant ethical issue. Furthermore, the
   findings of this study show that ethical misconduct is not restricted to
   a particular geographic location; it occurs in numerous countries. In
   turn, avenues of further study on research misconduct in management
   research are proposed.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present a methodology which takes as input a

   characterizes such entities according to multiple dimensions
   (disciplines, year of publication, sentiment, etc.), and applies a
   quantitative and qualitative analysis on the collected values. The
   methodology is composed of four phases: (1) identifying, retrieving, and
   extracting basic metadata of the entities which have cited a retracted
   article, (2) extracting and labeling additional features based on the
   textual content of the citing entities, (3) building a descriptive
   statistical summary based on the collected data, and finally (4) running
   a topic modeling analysis. The goal of the methodology is to generate
   data and visualizations that help understanding possible behaviors
   related to retraction cases. We present the methodology in a structured
   step-by-step form following its four phases, discuss its limits and
   possible workarounds, and list the planned future improvements.},

Title = {Analysis of duplicated publications in Russian journals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The article presents a study of publication ethics violations in
   Russian-language scientific publications related to the duplicated
   publication. The aim of the study is to assess the frequency of the
   above-noted violations in the data of eLIBRARY.RU, the largest
   aggregator of full texts of Russian-language scientific publications.
   For the purposes of the study, we used the tools of the ``Antiplagiat ``
   plagiarism detection system. Out of the almost 12 million full-text
   publications on the eLIBRARY.RU platform, more than 3.8 million
   scientific articles were selected for analysis. The study identified 70
   406 cases of duplication of publications. In each of the detected cases,
   the same - or significantly similar - texts were published two or more
   (up to 73) times. An analysis of the most significant cases by number of
   publications is presented along with a detailed discussion of examples
   of the identified violations. A significant increase in the number and
   proportion of duplicated publications was identified in the period from
   2014 to 2017. Conclusions are presented concerning shortcomings in
   editorial processes that allow duplication of publications along with
   the factual impossibility of detecting duplication in cases of
   simultaneous submission of the manuscript to different journals, the
   insufficient use by journal editors of means for detecting inappropriate
   borrowings and the need to retract a significant number of articles in
   connection with the identified violations.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The scientific journal Nature Methods have just retracted a publication
   that reported numerous unexpected mutations after a CRISPR-Cas9
   experiment based on collecting whole genome sequencing information from
   one control and two experimental genome edited mice. In the intervening
   10 months since publication the data presented have been strongly
   contested and criticized by the scientific and biotech communities,
   through publications, open science channels and social networks. The
   criticism focused on the animal used as control, which was derived from
   the same mouse strain as the experimental individuals but from an
   unrelated sub-colony, hence control and experimental mice were
   genetically divergent. The most plausible explanation for the vast
   majority of the reported unexpected mutations were the expected
   underlying genetic polymorphisms that normally accumulate in two
   different colonies of the same mouse strain which occur as a result of
   spontaneous mutations and genetic drift. Therefore, the reported
   mutations were most likely not related to CRISPR-Cas9 activity.},

Abstract = {Ethical considerations arise when individuals who were contracted and
   paid to conduct a research study and write it up for publication, are
   denied authorship on a scholarly publication on the grounds that their

   recognizes their intellectual contribution and their right to be named
   as authors if and when the contracted study is published. If authorship
   disputes of published works arise, journal editors should have
   mechanisms in place for addressing such disputes. They should be able to
   see the contract and have all disputing parties agree to any changes in
   authorship. If the dispute cannot be resolved, the manuscript should be
   retracted. Contractors should develop a publication plan and include in
   the contract stipulations ensuring transparent and unambiguous
   authorship on any publication ensuing from contracted work. The
   International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and the Committee for
   Publication Ethics should update their guidance for authors to include
   advice regarding researchers involved in contracted work and how to
   resolve an authorship disputes around it.},

   that article lifetime - that is the time period from initial publication
   to ultimate retraction - has decreased in recent years. It also shows
   that the retraction rate has also increased over the same period.
   Furthermore, over 20\% of retracted oncology publications analyzed in
   this study relate to treatment-relevant topics such as clinical trials
   and studies in the anticancer properties of supplements. Conclusion: The
   causes and context of these trends are discussed and reference made to
   the dangers of scientific misconduct in oncology.},

Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 18},
Abstract = {Expressions of concern (EoC) can reduce the adverse effects of
   unreliable publications by alerting readers to concerns about
   publication integrity while assessment is undertaken. We investigated
   the use of EoC for 463 publications by two research groups for which we
   notified concerns about publication integrity to 142 journals and 44
   publishers between March 2013 and February 2020. By December 2021, 95
   papers had had an EoC, and 83 were retracted without an EoC. Median
   times from notification of concerns to EoC (10.4mo) or retraction
   without EoC (13.1mo) were similar. Among the 95 EoCs, 29 (30.5\%) were
   followed by retraction after a median of 5.4mo, none was lifted, and 66
   (69.5\%) remained in place after a median of 18.1mo. Publishers with >10
   notified publications issued EoCs for 0-81.8\% of papers: for several
   publishers the proportions of notified papers for which EoCs were issued
   varied considerably between the 2 research groups. EoCs were issued for
   >30\% of notified publications of randomized clinical trials and letters
   to the editor, and <20\% of other types of research. These results
   demonstrate inconsistent application of EoCs between and within
   publishers, and prolonged times to issue and resolve EoCs.},

Title = {Is the soundness-only quality control policy of open access mega
   journals linked to a higher rate of published errors?},
Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},
Number = {2},
Pages = {917-923},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Open access mega journals (OAMJs) are broad and centralized open access
   journals that have come to represent profitable outlets for accumulating
   large volumes of research from multiple fields of study, including
   papers that are rejected from other journals by the same publisher. Some
   OAMJs charge hefty (exceeding US\$1000) article processing fees. One
   characteristic of OAMJs is a large editorial board. In 2015, Bjork
   indicated that a primary characteristic of an OAMJ was its
   prepublication soundness only peer review, i.e., novelty, significance,
   relevance and impact are assessed only post-publication. However, such a
   premise ignores the inherent nature of peers' bias. This controversial
   claim is challenged in this paper by assessing whether there is a link
   between research output (number of papers published in each OAMJ) and
   number of errata, including retractions. We assessed 16 OAMJs indexed in
   Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science and found wide variation in
   published errata and retractions across OAMJs between 2012 and 2018.
   PLOS ONE had the highest correction rate (3.159\%), followed by Medicine
   (3.158\%), BMJ Open (2.949\%) and Scientific Reports (2.896\%). In
   contrast, PeerJ, Elementa, and Science of the Anthropocene did not
   publish any errata in 2012-2018 but IEEE Access had a correction rate of
   0.059\%. Regarding the retraction rate, the highest share of retracted
   publications was seen in Medicine (0.079\%), Cell Reports (0.035\%) and
   PLOS ONE (0.030\%), while nine out of the 16 studied OAMJs did not have
   any retracted publications during 2012-2018. We conclude that there is
   wide variation in quality control, as assessed through errata and
   retractions, among OAMJs. We recommend, therefore, that the soundness
   only peer review prerequisite for OAMJs should be scrapped.},

Abstract = {Purpose of review COVID-19 pandemic has created profound ethical
   challenges, not only for clinical decision-making but also for defining
   physician professional conduct. Recent findings Multiple ethical
   questions arose as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged globally, including
   physician obligations in a pandemic, allotment of personal protective
   equipment, care of unvaccinated patients, discern between evidence-based
   and unreliable information, addressing end-of-life wishes, implications
   of involving medical students in a public health crisis, and finally
   physician burnout aggravated by a pandemic. There is a need to redefine
   existing medical professionalism standards so that future healthcare
   professionals are well prepared to deal with similar public health
   crisis.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Retractions in the Field of Cardiothoracic and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: No systematic studies on retractions in cardiothoracic and
   vascular anesthesia exist. The aim of this analysis was to identify
   characteristics and trends of retractions in this field over the past
   three decades. Design: A search of the Retraction Watch Database for
   retracted articles published between 1990 and 2020 in the field of
   cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia was performed. Setting: : A
   bibliometric study. Participants: Five thousand three hundred forty-four
   retractions with the term ``medicine{''} in the subject code were
   selected. Retractions of fulllength English articles reporting findings
   in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia were included. Measurements
   and Main Results: A total of 63 articles published in 31 journals from
   January 1990 to August 2020 were retracted. The majority were original
   articles (n = 60, 95.2\%) and retracted for scientific misconduct (n =
   50, 79.4\%). The percentage of retractions due to misconduct increased
   from 2010, with a spike in 2011 (n = 26/50, 52.0\%), and reached a
   plateau in 2014. The three most common reasons for retraction were
   misconduct by the author (n = 31, 49.2\%), duplication (n = 12, 19.0\%),
   and errors within the manuscript (n = 11, 17.5\%). The median time from
   publication to retraction was 4.3 years (IQR: 1.7-9.4) and decreased
   significantly over time (p < 0.001). The median impact factor (IF) of
   the journals that published retracted articles was 3.5 (IQR 2.0-4.5) and
   decreased significantly over the study period (p < 0.001). Conclusion:
   Scientific misconduct represents the most common reason for retraction
   in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia. The median time to retraction
   and journal IF decreased significantly over time. While this is
   promising, future efforts should be made to screen for falsified data
   and standardize the processes after retraction to highlight problematic
   manuscripts. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   the article, the Journal Editor received correspondence from the authors
   indicating that, through a series of miscommunications amongst them, it
   was discovered that formal Internal Review Board approvals were not
   properly secured prior to the study taking place or to the submission of
   the article for peer review in Ecopsychology, despite a statement in the
   paper indicating such approvals were in place. Upon discovering this
   violation, the authors sought- and received-post-publication approvals
   from their institutional Internal Review Board at Sapienza University of
   Rome (Italy). It is important to note, however, that informed consent
   was indeed obtained from each participant in the study. Though the
   Journal, its Editor, and its Publisher applaud the authors for
   selfreporting this situation, it remains a clear violation of proper and
   standard protocols for studies containing human subjects. Therefore, the
   Journal officially retracts the paper. Ecopsychology, its Editors, and
   its Publisher are committed to upholding the strictest standards of the
   scientific record and the community it serves and will not tolerate any
   improprieties or violations of proper scientific publishing conventions.},

   and moderately altered text, but often fail to detect strong
   paraphrases, translations, and the reuse of non-textual content and

   We present the first plagiarism detection approach that combines the
   analysis of mathematical expressions, images, citations and text. ii) We
   describe the implementation of this hybrid detection approach in the
   research prototype HyPlag. iii) We present novel visualization and
   interaction concepts to aid users in reviewing content similarities
   identified by the hybrid detection approach. iv) We demonstrate the
   usefulness of the hybrid detection and result visualization approaches
   by using HyPlag to analyze a confirmed case of content reuse present in
   a retracted research publication.},

   field. In this study, we continued with our previous finding of
   spontaneous transformation of cynomolgus MSCs and provided further
   evidence using short tandem repeat analysis that the transformed
   mesenchymal stem cells were indeed derived from cynomolgus MSCs. (C)

   Molecular and Cellular Biology Experience},
Journal = {MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We analyzed 960 papers published in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB)
   from 2009 to 2016 and found 59 (6.1\%) to contain inappropriately
   duplicated images. The 59 instances of inappropriate image duplication
   led to 41 corrections, 5 retractions, and 13 instances in which no
   action was taken. Our experience suggests that the majority of
   inappropriate image duplications result from errors during figure
   preparation that can be remedied by correction. Nevertheless, similar to
   10\% of papers with inappropriate image duplications in MCB were
   retracted (similar to 0.5\% of total). If this pro- portion is
   representative, then as many as 35,000 papers in the literature are
   candi-dates for retraction due to inappropriate image duplication. The
   resolution of inappropriate image duplication concerns after publication
   required an average of 6 h of journal staff time per published paper.
   MCB instituted a pilot program to screen images of accepted papers prior
   to publication that identified 12 manuscripts (14.5\% out of 83) with
   image concerns in 2 months. The screening and correction of papers
   before publication required an average of 30 min of staff time per
   problematic paper. Image screening can identify papers with problematic
   images prior to publication, reduces postpublication problems, and
   requires less staff time than the correction of problems after
   publication.},

Abstract = {Journals are failing in their obligation to ensure that research is
   fairly represented to their readers, and must act decisively to retract
   fraudulent publications. Recent case reports have exposed how marketing
   objectives usurped scientific testing and compromised the credibility of
   academic medicine. But scant attention has been given to the role that
   journals play in this process, especially when evidence of research
   fraud fails to elicit corrective measures. Our experience with The
   Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
   (JAACAP) illustrates the nature of the problem. The now-infamous Study
   329 of paroxetine in adolescent depression was negative for efficacy on
   all eight protocol-specified outcomes and positive for harm, but JAACAP
   published a report of this study that concluded that oparoxetine is
   generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in
   adolescents.o The journal's editors not only failed to exercise critical
   judgment in accepting the article, but when shown evidence that the
   article misrepresented the science, refused either to convey this
   information to the medical community or to retract the article.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The science community generally believes that the violation of research
   integrity is rare. Built upon this belief, the scientific system makes
   little effort to examine the trustworthiness of research. Research
   misconduct refers to an intentional violation of research integrity
   principles, which has an extensive and far-reaching impact on the
   trustworthiness and reputation of science. Emerging evidence has
   suggested that research misconduct is far more common than we normally
   perceive. Far more problematic papers should be retracted than are being
   retracted because of poor actions when confronting research misconduct.
   Research misconduct is usually driven by incentives in the form of
   pursuing publications for researchers' career needs and is further
   facilitated by poor research governance. The current strategy that
   tackles potential research misconduct focuses on protecting the
   reputation of authors and their institutions but neglects the interests
   of patients, clinicians and honest researchers. Removing improper
   incentives, training researchers and imposing better governance are
   vital to reducing research misconduct. Awareness of the possibility of
   misconduct and formalized procedures that scrutinize study
   trustworthiness are important during peer review and in systematic
   reviews.},

Abstract = {Comparing 5 publications from China that described knockdowns of the
   human TPD52L2 gene in human cancer cell lines identified unexpected
   similarities between these publications, flaws in experimental design,
   and mis-matches between some described experiments and the reported
   results. Following communications with journal editors, two of these
   TPD52L2 publications have been retracted. One retraction notice stated
   that while the authors claimed that the data were original, the
   experiments had been out-sourced to a biotechnology company. Using
   search engine queries, automatic text-analysis, different similarity
   measures, and further visual inspection, we identified 48 examples of
   highly similar papers describing single gene knockdowns in 1-2 human
   cancer cell lines that were all published by investigators from China.
   The incorrect use of a particular TPD52L2 shRNA sequence as a negative
   or non-targeting control was identified in 30/48 (63\%) of these
   publications, using a combination of Google Scholar searches and visual
   inspection. Overall, these results suggest that some publications
   describing the effects of single gene knockdowns in human cancer cell
   lines may include the results of experiments that were not performed by
   the authors. This has serious implications for the validity of such
   results, and for their application in future research.},

Abstract = {Editors of scientific journals need to be conversant with the mechanisms
   by which scientific misconduct is amplified by publication practices.
   This paper provides definitions, ways to document the extent of the
   problem, and examples of editorial attempts to counter fraud.
   Fabrication, falsification, duplication, ghost authorship, gift
   authorship, lack of ethics approval, non-disclosure, `salami'
   publication, conflicts of interest, auto-citation, duplicate submission,
   duplicate publications, and plagiarism are common problems. Editorial
   misconduct includes failure to observe due process, undue delay in
   reaching decisions and communicating these to authors, inappropriate
   review procedures, and confounding a journal's content with its
   advertising or promotional potential. Editors also can be admonished by
   their peers for failure to investigate suspected misconduct, failure to
   retract when indicated, and failure to abide voluntarily by the six main
   sources of relevant international guidelines on research, its reporting
   and editorial practice. Editors are in a good position to promulgate
   reasonable standards of practice, and can start by using consensus
   guidelines on publication ethics to state explicitly how their journals
   function. Reviewers, editors, authors and readers all then have a better
   chance to understand, and abide by, the rules of publishing.},

Title = {LNTgate: How LNT benefited from editorial actions},
Journal = {CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {362},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {This paper illustrates how the acceptance of the linear non-threshold
   (LNT) dose response model was unethically advocated and advanced both by
   key scientists within the radiation genetics community, and by editorial
   practices in Science, a leading international scientific journal. Four
   key papers became the cornerstones in the acceptance of the LNT model.
   In the publication process of these papers, editorial decisions to
   circumvent peer review occurred in at least two cases. As well, the
   summarized data of one paper were never shared with the scientific
   community and remain missing to date. Publication of a paper in Science
   on which a senior editor of the journal was a co-author is alleged to
   have intentionally falsified the research record (BEAR Genetics Panel).
   These findings raise the question of whether foundational papers for
   major contemporary regulatory policy (i.e., LNT/cancer risk assessment)
   that lack scientific legitimacy, as identified herein, should be
   retracted. These findings also should serve as the basis for
   considerable ethical concern, as well as a prompt for ongoing ethical
   diligence and rigor in the conduct and publication of scientific
   research.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Retractions of scientific papers published by some Iran-affiliated
   scientists in the preceding decade have attracted much attention and
   publicity; however, the reasons for these retractions have not been
   documented. We searched the Retraction Watch Database to enumerate the
   retracted Iran-affiliated papers from December 2001 to December 2019 and
   aimed to outline the predominant reasons for retractions. The reasons
   included fake peer-review, authorship dispute, fabricated data,
   plagiarism, conflict of interest, erroneous data, and duplication. The
   Fisher's exact test was used to investigate the associations between
   retractions and their underlying reasons. We selected P < 0.05 to
   indicate the statistically significant differences. We found 697
   retracted papers. Duplication (27\%), plagiarism (26\%), and fake
   peer-review (21\%) were the most frequent reasons for retractions. Our
   study highlights the importance of urgent intervention to prevent the
   misconduct and questionable research practices that lead to retractions
   in Iran. Continually educating the scientists and postgraduate students
   about the ethics and norms of scientific publishing is an important
   measure to ensure publication of reliable, worthy, and impactful papers.},

Title = {A bibliometric study on the publication errors in emergency medicine

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {140-144},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: The literature on scientific publication errors in medical
   research is limited, and no studies on emer-gency medicine publications
   have been conducted yet. This study aimed to investigate the
   characteristics of the publication errors in emergency medicine
   literature.Methods: This bibliometric study reviewed intervened
   publication errors in the manuscripts of seven high-impact emergency
   medicine journals from 2000 to 2020, covering twenty years, and
   evaluated the corrections in the forms of an erratum, corrigendum,
   addendum, and retracted papers. The detected publication error rate and
   the trend, error severity, and error types were calculated.Results: We
   detected 257 intervened scientific papers consisting of 251 corrections
   due to one or more publica-tion errors and six retractions. Authors were
   the primary source of the errors (93.2\%). Most of the errors were in
   the author attribution section (40.5\%). The published errors of 7.2\%
   had an impact on the paper's conclusion. Sim-ple typographic errors were
   the most common error type (62.5\%). The corrected publication error
   rate was 1.3\%, with a steady trend over the twenty years.Conclusions:
   Publications errors are inevitable, but it is possible to minimize them.
   The number of corrections in emergency medicine literature is at a low
   rate and show many similarities with the previous literature.(c) 2022

Title = {Scholarly rumors: Citation analysis of vast misinformation regarding
   parental alienation theory},
Journal = {BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES \& THE LAW},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 29},
Abstract = {Misinformation is widespread in political discourse, mental health
   literature, and hard science. This article describes recurrent
   publication of the same misinformation regarding parental alienation
   (PA), that is, variations of the statement: ``PA theory assumes that the
   favored parent has caused PA in the child simply because the child
   refuses to have a relationship with the rejected parent, without
   identifying or proving alienating behaviors by the favored parent. ``
   Ninety-four examples of the same misinformation were identified and
   subjected to citation analysis using Gephi software, which displays the
   links between citing material and cited material. The recurrent
   misinformation reported here is not trivial; these statements are
   significant misrepresentations of PA theory. Plausible explanations for
   this trail of misinformation are the psychological mindset of the
   authors (i.e., confirmation bias) and the authors' writing skills (e.g.,
   sloppy research practices such as persistent use of secondary sources
   for their information). The authors of this article recommend that
   publications containing significant misinformation should be corrected
   or retracted.},

Abstract = {In this article, we show the results of a quantitative and qualitative
   analysis of open citations on a popular and highly cited retracted
   paper: ``Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and
   pervasive developmental disorder in children{''} by Wakefield et al.,
   published in 1998. The main purpose of our study is to understand the
   behavior of the publications citing one retracted article and the
   characteristics of the citations the retracted article accumulated over
   time. Our analysis is based on a methodology which illustrates how we
   gathered the data, extracted the topics of the citing articles and
   visualized the results. The data and services used are all open and free
   to foster the reproducibility of the analysis. The outcomes concerned
   the analysis of the entities citing Wakefield et al.'s article and their
   related in-text citations. We observed a constant increasing number of
   citations in the last 20 years, accompanied with a constant increment in
   the percentage of those acknowledging its retraction. Citing articles
   have started either discussing or dealing with the retraction of
   Wakefield et al.'s article even before its full retraction happened in
   2010. Articles in the social sciences domain citing the Wakefield et
   al.'s one were among those that have mostly discussed its retraction. In
   addition, when observing the in-text citations, we noticed that a large
   number of the citations received by Wakefield et al.'s article has
   focused on general discussions without recalling strictly medical
   details, especially after the full retraction. Medical studies did not
   hesitate in acknowledging the retraction of the Wakefield et al.'s
   article and often provided strong negative statements on it.},

Abstract = {Background: Retractions of erroneous and fraudulent papers from the
   biomedical literature continue to be a major concern. The aim of this
   analysis is to summarize trends of retractions in the cardiovascular
   literature over the past four decades. Methods: A review of the
   Retraction Watch database for retracted articles published between 1978
   and 2020 in the cardiovascular literature was performed. Retractions
   with the term ``medicine{''} in the subject code were selected. Titles
   and abstracts were reviewed and only retractions of articles in
   cardiovascular medicine and surgery were included. Results: 459
   retraction notices published in 228 journals were identified. The number
   of retractions increased with time from 1 in 1991 to 48 at the end of
   2019 (P < 0.001). Overall, the yearly percentage of retraction increased
   during the study period (P < 0.001) but decreased after 2015. China had
   the highest percentage of retractions when compared to other countries
   (P < 0.001). The majority of articles were retracted for scientific
   misconduct (n = 289, 63.0\%); retractions due to scientific misconduct
   increased significantly over the study period (P = 0.04) but decreased
   after 2015. The median time from publication to retraction was 1.4 years
   (interquartile range {[}IQR]: 0.6-3.8) and decreased significantly over
   time (P < 0.001). The median number of citations of retracted articles
   was 8.0. Conclusions: The number of retractions and the yearly
   percentage of retraction in the cardiovascular literature increased
   significantly during the study period, although a decrease was seen
   after 2015. Scientific misconduct represents the most common reason for
   retraction, although a reduction has been observed in the last five
   years.},

Abstract = {Retractions solicited by authors following the discovery of an
   unintentional error-what we henceforth call a ``self-retraction{''}-are
   a new phenomenon of growing importance, about which very little is
   known. Here we present results of a small qualitative study aimed at
   gaining preliminary insights about circumstances, motivations and
   beliefs that accompanied the experience of a self-retraction. We
   identified retraction notes that unambiguously reported an honest error
   and that had been published between the years 2010 and 2015. We limited
   our sample to retractions with at least one co-author based in the
   Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany or a Scandinavian country,
   and we invited these authors to a semi-structured interview. Fourteen
   authors accepted our invitation. Contrary to our initial assumptions,
   most of our interviewees had not originally intended to retract their
   paper. They had contacted the journal to request a correction and the
   decision to retract had been made by journal editors. All interviewees
   reported that having to retract their own publication made them
   concerned for their scientific reputation and career, often causing
   considerable stress and anxiety. Interviewees also encountered
   difficulties in communicating with the journal and recalled other
   procedural issues that had unnecessarily slowed down the process of
   self-retraction. Intriguingly, however, all interviewees reported how,
   contrary to their own expectations, the self-retraction had brought no
   damage to their reputation and in some cases had actually improved it.
   We also examined the ethical motivations that interviewees ascribed,
   retrospectively, to their actions and found that such motivations
   included a combination of moral and prudential (i.e. pragmatic)
   considerations. These preliminary results suggest that scientists would
   welcome innovations to facilitate the process of self-retraction.},

Title = {Assessment of Citations of the Retracted Article by Wakefield et al With
   Fraudulent Claims of an Association Between Vaccination and Autism},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {IMPORTANCE The number of citations can be used to show the influence of
   an article or to measure the validity of a research study. The article
   by Wakefield et al that fraudulently reported an association between
   vaccination and autism continues to accumulate citations even after it
   was retracted.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the characteristics of citations from scholarly
   literature that reference the 1998 article by Wakefield et al and to
   investigate whether authors are accurately citing retracted references.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional bibliographic
   analysis of the scholarly publications that cited a 1998 article by
   Wakefield et al, cited references were collected from a Web of Science
   Core Collection search performed on March 11, 2019. A total of 1211
   articles were identified, with 58 citing works excluded because they
   were non-English-language publications or the citation to the study by
   Wakefield et al could not be located by reviewers. Citing works
   consisted of books, research articles, letters, editorials, news items,
   and other scholarly literature. Citations to the article by Wakefield et
   al were identified and analyzed by 2 reviewers in a blinded screening.
   Reviewers assigned a characteristic to each citation and indicated
   whether the retraction was documented.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The characteristics of citations to the
   article by Wakefield et al, were categorized as negative, affirmative,
   or contrastive; if not, persuasive; and if not, assumptive, perfunctory,
   methodologic, or conceptual. Whether the partial retraction or notice of
   retraction was included in the citing work was also documented.
   RESULTS Among the 1153 citing works included in this analysis, the most
   common citation characteristics were negative (838 {[}72.7\%]) followed
   by perfunctory (106 {[}9.2\%]) and affirmative (94 {[}8.2\%]). A total
   of 123 of 322 citing works (38.2\%) published between 2005 and 2010
   documented the partial retraction. After the notof retraction was
   published in 2010, the percentage of citing works that documented the
   partial retraction and/or notice of retraction between 2011 and 2018
   increased to 360 of 502 (71.7\%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since the article by Wakefield et al was
   initially published, authors have mostly negated the findings of the
   study. A significant number of authors did not document retractions of
   the article by Wakefield et al. The findings suggest that improvements
   are needed from publishers, bibliographic databases, and citation
   management software to ensure that retracted articles are accurately
   documented.},

Abstract = {Background: Science is a dynamic subject with ever-changing concepts and
   is said to be self-correcting. One of the major mechanisms of
   self-correction is retraction of flawed work. Aim: To study the various
   parameters associated with retraction of scientific articles in 2012 and
   2013 and discuss the current trends in article retraction over the
   period of 2 years. Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved from
   MEDLINE (via PubMed) using the keywords retraction of articles,
   retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in January 2014, and
   analysis of articles published in 2012 and 2013 was carried out.
   Results: A total of 155 articles in 2012 and 182 in 2013 were retracted,
   and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of
   it. The most cited reasons for retraction were mistakes, plagiarism, and
   duplicate submission, and the time interval between submission and
   retraction had reduced in 2013. Conclusion: Although retracted articles
   constitute the tip of an iceberg, they are still a matter of major
   concern in the scientific world. So, editors should follow the Committee
   on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and make an effective strategy
   in order to reduce such misconduct, as it reflects very adversely not
   only in the scientific community but also in the general public.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A duplicate publication, or parts thereof, without disclosure, is now
   definitively considered to be an ethical infraction. The amount of
   duplication usually determines the correction that is necessary, either
   an erratum or a retraction. Such duplications can exist as a result of
   error, misconduct, or even gray areas in between. In the highly
   competitive market of scholarly and academic publishing, there exists
   constant pressure, and thus temptation, to boost output. Academics who
   are not native English speakers, or who publish in journals whose
   primary language is not English, may also consider publishing their data
   sets in their native language. There are increasing cases of duplicated
   data and papers in the English literature that have been corrected or
   retracted as a result of undeclared prior publication in another journal
   and language. This letter explores some of the discussion points
   surrounding duplicate publications in two languages. Provided that
   multiple sources in two or more languages that report the same data,
   text, ideas, concepts, methodologies or analyses are clearly
   cross-referenced, thereby alerting the editors, peers and readers that
   such aspects have been previously published, there is a reduced risk of
   an ethical infraction. In fact, secondary publications in two or more
   languages could benefit a wider pool of scientists. However, undeclared
   duplications, whole or in part, are considered to be ethical
   infractions.},

   their evidence; it is often based on entrenched assumptions and on
   mis-representing published material. The arguments have challenged
   normal healthy scientific dialogue, and appear to be driven by other
   motives. A further interpretation of Seralini et al's results on tumour
   formation is suggested. The probability that Seralini et al's results
   are significant is sufficient to justify further study.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The full-text publication of abstracts presented at any
   given scientific meeting in peer-reviewed journals is accepted as a
   measure of scientific quality of that particular meeting. The aim of
   this study is to determine the full-text publication rate of abstracts
   presented at the 2005 Scientific Meeting of the Undersea and Hyperbaric
   Medical Society (UHMS).
   Methods: We identified the scientific abstracts presented at the 2005
   UHMS meeting and searched the PubMed database (June 2005 to July 2010)
   for their corresponding full-text publication. We recorded the following
   parameters for each of the abstracts: number of authors, number of
   centers involved in the study, statistical methods used, country of
   origin of the study, study type, and subject of the abstract. We
   recorded the time to publication and the title of the journal if the
   abstract had been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
   Results: Overall, we identified 187 abstracts presented at the 2005 UHMS
   meeting. Two of the abstracts were excluded from the study because they
   had been retracted from the meeting and six more because they had been
   already published as full-text articles at the time the meeting was
   held. Of the 179 abstracts, 62 (34.6\%) were published as full-text
   articles within the succeeding five years. The mean (+/- SD) time to
   publication was 18.5 (+/- 13.6) months. Multivariate analysis with
   logistic regression identified ``country of origin{''} and ``the subject
   of the abstract{''} as independent predictors of full-text publication.
   Conclusion: We found that only one-third of the abstracts presented at
   the 2005 UHMS meeting were published as full-text articles within the
   succeeding five years. Although this rate is consistent with similar
   studies from various disciplines, further research is needed to identify
   the specific barriers to full-text publication of abstracts in the field
   of underwater and hyperbaric medicine.},

Volume = {118},

Pages = {339-373},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is a mounting worry about erroneous and outright fraudulent
   research that gets published in the scientific literature. Although peer
   review's ability to filter out such publications is contentious, several
   peer review innovations attempt to do just that. However, there is very
   little systematic evidence documenting the ability of different review
   procedures to flag problematic publications. In this article, we use
   survey data on peer review in a wide range of journals to compare the
   retraction rates of specific review procedures, using the Retraction
   Watch database. We were able to identify which peer review procedures
   were used since 2000 for 361 journals, publishing a total of 833,172
   articles, of which 670 were retracted. After addressing the dual
   character of retractions, signalling both a failure to identify problems
   prior to publication, but also the willingness to correct mistakes, we
   empirically assess review procedures. With considerable conceptual
   caveats, we were able to identify peer review procedures that seem able
   to detect problematic research better than others. Results were verified
   for disciplinary differences and variation between reasons for
   retraction. This leads to informed recommendations for journal editors
   about strengths and weaknesses of specific peer review procedures,
   allowing them to select review procedures that address issues most
   relevant to their field.},

Abstract = {It has been proposed that the scientific literature purges itself of
   articles known to be fraudulent. To test this, an investigation was
   carried out of post-retraction citations over a 19-year period in the
   Breuning case.
   On 10 March 2008 a cited reference search was conducted (all languages,
   all document types) using the name `Breuning SE{*}'. The time limit was
   1989-2007 with an option to exclude self-citations. The search included
   the ISI Web of Science Database including the Science Citation Index
   Expanded, the Social Sciences Citations Index and the Arts \& Humanities
   Citation Index. To ascertain the citation context, citations of Breuning
   were classified by two raters as affirmative, negative or neutral.
   For the period 1989-2000 both negative and affirmative citations were
   found. For the period 2001-2006 only affirmative citations (even to
   retracted articles) were found, some in journals with higher impact
   factors than those citing the case as fraudulent. In spite of the small
   number of citations of Breuning's articles, it is alarming that the
   affirmative citing of fraudulent research has not completely ceased but
   continues 24 years post-retraction (retracted 1982, cited 2006). While
   the limitations of a single case study are conceded, the results
   challenge the belief of scientific literature purging itself of
   fraudulent material.
   Retraction databases and widespread availability of computer software to
   check lists of references free of charge in any database or the internet
   are called for. Moreover, if a paper is never formally retracted,
   software for searching author names in the internet for fully
   investigated and proven scientific misconduct might be developed. The
   ethical guidelines on duplicate publication for purposes of
   disseminating the information as widely as possible should be reviewed.},

Abstract = {Retraction notices are expected to be transparent about entities
   accountable for retractions and their reasons for retraction. No
   previous research on retraction notices has investigated accountable
   entities other than authors of retracted publications and their reasons
   for retraction from a cross-disciplinary and a diachronic perspective.
   Drawing on a dataset of 7650 unique retraction notices published before
   2020 and indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, this study
   identified 457 retraction notices that held four types of non-author
   entities accountable. Journal authorities (i.e., editors and publishers)
   were found responsible for retractions in 62.14\% of the retraction
   notices, followed by unidentifiable entities (26.91\%), third parties
   (6.13\%), and dual entities (i.e., both authors and journal authorities,
   4.81\%). The three most frequent reasons for retraction were
   republication of valid publications (36.76\%), unspecified reasons
   (26.91\%), and publication of unpublishable work (17.07\%). Accountable
   non-author entities were more identifiable in the retraction notices
   published between 2010 and 2019 than in those published before 2010.
   Retraction notices in soft disciplines were more likely than those in
   hard disciplines to identify journal authorities as accountable
   entities. These findings offer implications for handling retractions
   more effectively and efficiently.},

Title = {Retracted articles in the obstetrics literature: lessons from the past

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The publication of invalid scientific findings may have
   profound implications on medical practice. As the incidence of article
   retractions has increased over the last 2 decades, organizations have
   formed, including Retraction Watch, to improve the transparency of
   scientific publishing. At present, the incidence of article retraction
   in the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature is unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the number of retracted
   articles within the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature
   from the PubMed and Retraction Watch databases and examine reasons for
   retraction.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the PubMed and Retraction Watch
   databases was performed to identify retracted articles in the obstetrics
   and maternal-fetal medicine literature from indexation through December
   31, 2019. The primary outcome was defined as the number of identified
   articles and reason for retraction. Within PubMed, articles were
   identified using a medical subheading search for articles categorized as
   withdrawn or retracted. In addition, the Retraction Watch database was
   queried and non obstetrical articles were excluded. The reason for
   retraction was classified according to the categories listed in
   Retraction Watch. The subject matter was classified on the basis of the
   Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine criteria. Data were collected from
   retracted articles for author name, country, journal name and impact
   factor, year of publication and retraction, study type, and response of
   the publishing journal. Descriptive statistics were performed.
   RESULTS: Of the 519 obstetrics and gynecology articles in Retraction
   Watch, 122 (23.5\%) were specific to the obstetrics and maternal-fetal
   medicine specialties. In addition, 39 (32.0\%) were identified from
   PubMed, all of which were included in Retraction Watch. There was a
   median time to retraction of 1 (range, 0-17) year, with a median of 3
   citations per article (range, 0-145). In addition, the median journal
   impact factor was 2.2 (range, 0.1-27.6), with median first and senior
   author Hirsch index values of 6.0 and 13.5, respectively. Most articles
   were original research (n=80; 65.6\%), specifically retrospective
   studies (n=11; 9.0\%), case reports (n=19; 15.6\%), prospective studies
   (n=18; 14.8\%), randomized controlled trials (n=11; 9\%), basic science
   (n=18; 14.8\%), and systematic review or meta-analysis (n=3; 2.5\%). Of
   eligible articles, 32 (26.2\%) were published in journals with an impact
   factor >= 4, and 21 articles (17.2\%) were published in the top 10
   leading impact factor obstetrics and gynecology journals. Most
   retractions were for content-related issues (n=87; 71.3\%), including
   21.3\% (n=26) for article duplication, 18.9\% (n=23) for plagiarism, and
   16.4\% (n=20) for errors in results or methods. Additional reasons
   included author misconduct (n=12; 9.8\%), nonreproducible results (n=11;
   9.0\%), and falsification (n=8; 6.6\%). The most common journal response
   was an issued statement of retraction (n=82; 67.2\%). Lack of retraction
   notice and limited to no information provided by the publishing journal
   occurred in 19 retracted articles (15.6\%).
   CONCLUSION: In the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature,
   retraction of scientific articles is increasing and is most often
   related to scientific misconduct, including article duplication and
   plagiarism. Improved prevention and detection are warranted by journals
   and healthcare institutions to ensure that invalid findings are not
   perpetuated in the medical literature, thereby avoiding adverse
   consequences for maternal and perinatal care.},

Abstract = {Publication metrics enable the assessment of the performance of
   citations or utilization of published work. Journal-level metrics depend
   on the database whose citations are analyzed. Publication metrics from
   the Web of Science include the widely-used journal impact factor (JIF)
   and other indices such as Journal Citation Impact, Eigenfactor,
   normalized Eigenfactor, and Article Influence Score. Metrics from Scopus
   include the CiteScore, Source Normalized Impact Factor, and SCImago
   Journal Rank. Author-level metrics such as total citations, h-index,
   i10-index, and g-index inevitably increase with time and can be inflated
   by self-citations. Article-level metrics such as total citations and
   online attention scores derived from Scopus (PlumX Metrics) or Altmetric
   indicate the extent of utilization and discussion in scientific circles
   of a particular article. Publication metrics are useful to provide a
   bird's eye view of how well an individual journal or article has been
   cited or used. They do not necessarily reflect article quality. As an
   example, some of the articles with the highest Altmetric Attention
   Scores are actually retracted publications that attained high scores due
   to the negative debate that they elicited. Journal-level metrics such as
   the JIF are fluid and prone to historical fluctuations from year to
   year, most recently observed by increases in the JIF of journals which
   published a lot of coronavirus disease 19-related content. Research
   assessment of individual scientists often misuses publication metrics
   such as the JIF, when they should instead rely on a critical appraisal
   of research articles by assessors.},

Abstract = {Academic publishing is undergoing a highly transformative process, and
   many established rules and value systems that are in place, such as
   traditional peer review (TPR) and preprints, are facing unprecedented
   challenges, including as a result of post-publication peer review. The
   integrity and validity of the academic literature continue to rely
   naively on blind trust, while TPR and preprints continue to fail to
   effectively screen out errors, fraud, and misconduct. Imperfect TPR
   invariably results in imperfect papers that have passed through varying
   levels of rigor of screening and validation. If errors or misconduct
   were not detected during TPR's editorial screening, but are detected at
   the post-publication stage, an opportunity is created to correct the
   academic record. Currently, the most common forms of correcting the
   academic literature are errata, corrigenda, expressions of concern, and
   retractions or withdrawals. Some additional measures to correct the
   literature have emerged, including manuscript versioning, amendments,
   partial retractions and retract and replace. Preprints can also be
   corrected if their version is updated. This paper discusses the risks,
   benefits and limitations of these forms of correcting the academic
   literature.},

Abstract = {Research on scientific misconduct relies increasingly on retractions of
   articles. An interdisciplinary line of research has been established
   that empirically assesses the phenomenon of scientific misconduct using
   information on retractions, and thus aims to shed light on aspects of
   misconduct that previously were hidden. However, comparability and
   interpretability of studies are to a certain extent impeded by an
   absence of standards in corpus delineation and by the fact that the
   validity of this empirical data basis has never been systematically
   scrutinized. This article assesses the conceptual and empirical
   delineation of retractions against related publication types through a
   comparative analysis of the coverage and consistency of retraction
   annotation in the databases PubMed and the Web of Science (WoS), which
   are both commonly used for empicial studies on retractions. The
   searching and linking approaches of the WoS were subsequently evaluated.
   The results indicate that a considerable number of PubMed retracted
   publications and retractions are not labeled as such in the WoS or are
   indistinguishable from corrections, which is highly relevant for corpus
   and sample strategies in the WoS.},

Abstract = {Small conditional RNAs were used to kill cells selectively in a prior
   report. The method utilized the cellular innate immune response to
   dsRNA, causing PKR activation and cell death. We designed small
   conditional RNAs specific to a highly restricted transcript, that of the
   mesothelin gene expressed in various cancer lines and specific to a
   tpc/hpr fusion transcript expressed in a published control line.
   Hairpins of small conditional RNAs were functionally active in cell-free
   conditions. Hairpins were transfected into 6 types of cells. We observed
   non-specific killing of cells after transfection of the hairpins
   targeting the reported fusion transcript or of the mesothelin
   transcript. Thus when attempting to use this system for a special
   purpose, to target cancer mutations, the results were not satisfactory.
   Specifically when repeating the work described in the publication, we
   could not replicate the results using the methods described. Recently
   the publication was retracted but without comment on the validity of the
   reported method. Here we provide scientific basis to consider the method
   impaired or invalid.},

   The retraction is due to the article containing scientific errors and
   unreliable data that render the conclusions of this article invalid.
   Following publication, concerns were raised by third parties regarding
   errors in the scientific data presented. An investigation was undertaken
   which confirmed these concerns. The authors were given an opportunity to

Abstract = {Plagiarism is appropriation of someone else's ideas, texts, images and
   other materials without acknowledging their author. It is a serious
   violation of publication ethics that once detected results in the
   retraction of the submitted article. It has a disastrous impact on the
   author's reputation, because the publication is not removed from online
   databases, but stored there with a retracted publication tag. Plagiarism
   comes in different forms many of which still cannot be detected even by
   a special software; Plagiarism comes in different forms; the originality
   of an article is still assessed by peer reviewers and readers in the
   first place. Plagiarism can be unintentional. Most often, poor citation
   and reference style is typical of young researchers. To avoid unpleasant
   situations, authors are advised to use paraphrasing instead of merely
   copying and pasting fragments of texts. A verbatim use of a source
   requires quotation marks, references are expected to come right after
   the fragment borrowed from the original source; with multiple references
   (from 5 to10) pointing to a single idea are bad style. Authors are
   advised to always double check basic information about the publication
   they specify in a reference. The first author and a corresponding author
   are expected to monitor the quality of their co-authors' work. Full or
   partial copying of a previously published article by the same author is
   considered self-plagiarism and does not comply with the guidelines of
   the majority of academic journals.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper explores the nature and impact of research misconduct in
   psychology by analyzing 160 articles that were retracted from prominent
   scholarly journals between 1998 and 2017. We compare findings with
   recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and
   management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in
   cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason
   for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make,
   and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals,
   than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors
   should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article
   retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a
   greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a
   debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more
   critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical
   significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are
   Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering
   research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity
   of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the
   context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science
   research. We also challenge individual researchers to reassert the
   primacy of disinterested academic inquiry above pressures that can lead
   to an erosion of scholarly integrity.},

   articles but reviews and editorials, and therefore, the absence of

   manuscripts is questionable since the number of preprints has increased
   due to the need of fast publication of COVID-19-related articles.
   Furthermore, the number of retracted articles during the pandemic is
   exceptionally high. Media have an important role in the distribution of
   incorrect information, nevertheless individual people and policy makers
   are also responsible. As misinformation thrives in crisis periods,
   well-designed studies are needed to flatten the infodemic curve

   This letter argues that systems-oriented disciplines, such as complexity
   science and human factors, offer insights into new ways of dealing with
   ethics in publishing. Some examples of insights are presented. Also, a
   call is made for empirical studies that unveil the context and details
   of both retracted papers and the process of writing and publishing
   academic papers. This is expected to shed light on the complexity of the
   publication system as well as to support the development of a just

Abstract = {According to Ernest Jones, Sandor Ferenczi's mental condition took a
   pathological turn before the onset of the pernicious anaemia that
   finally killed him. Drawing on little-known documents, the author
   demonstrates that shortly after the publication of the third volume of
   Jones' biography of Freud the aspersions he cast there (and elsewhere)
   on Ferenczi's sanity were unequivocally refuted but never retracted. In
   an attempt to fathom the motives for this bizarre omission, the author
   advances the thesis that the myth of Ferenczi's mental decline was
   deliberately left in currency as this would facilitate suppressing the
   ideas of a dissident and accordingly bolster the endeavors of Freud's
   future inheritors in forming a united front as internal and external
   representatives of psychoanalysis.},

Abstract = {Retraction of flawed articles is an important mechanism for correction
   of the scientific literature. We recently reported that the majority of
   retractions are associated with scientific misconduct. In the current
   study, we focused on the subset of retractions for which no misconduct
   was identified, in order to identify the major causes of error. Analysis
   of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed
   that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory
   errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common
   laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular
   biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to
   contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors
   are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not
   been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest
   that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In
   particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were
   found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous
   publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can
   guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the
   scientific literature. Perhaps most important, our analysis has
   identified major problems in the mechanisms used to rectify the
   scientific literature and suggests a need for action by the scientific
   community to adopt protocols that ensure the integrity of the
   publication process.},

Abstract = {Plagiarism is one of the most frequent forms of research misconduct in
   South and East Asian countries. This narrative review examines the
   factors contributing to research misconduct, emphasizing plagiarism,
   particularly in South, East and Southeast Asian countries. We conducted
   a PubMed and Scopus search using the terms plagiarism, Asia, South Asia,
   East Asia, Southeast Asia, research misconduct and retractions in
   January of 2022. Articles with missing abstracts, incomplete information
   about plagiarism, publication dates before 2010, and those unrelated to
   South, East, and Southeast Asian countries were excluded. The retraction
   watch database was searched for articles retracted between 9th January
   2020 to 9th January 2022. A total of 159 articles were identified, of
   which 21 were included in the study using the database search criteria
   mentioned above. The review of articles identified a lack of training in
   scientific writing and research ethics, publication pressure, permissive
   attitudes, and inadequate regulatory measures as the primary reasons
   behind research misconduct in scientific publications. Plagiarism
   remains a common cause of unethical publications and retractions in
   regions of Asia (namely South, East and Southeast). Researchers lack
   training in scientific writing, and substantial gaps exist in
   understanding various forms of plagiarism, which heavily contribute to
   the problem. There is an urgent need to foster high research ethics
   standards and adhere to journal policies. Providing appropriate training
   in scientific writing among researchers may help improve the knowledge
   of different types of plagiarism and promote the use of antiplagiarism
   software, leading to a substantial reduction in the problem.},

Title = {Research on retracted papers involving ethical issues in science and

Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},

Volume = {68},

Pages = {1621-1625},
Abstract = {The ethical governance of scientific and technical papers is an
   important part of the ethical governance system of science and
   technology. The scientific research involved in a paper should comply
   with the ethical norms of science and technology, conform to ethical
   review procedures, and satisfy informed consent and privacy protection.
   In this paper, we used the information of Retraction Watch Database to
   collect cases of retracted papers in international scientific and
   technical journals due to ethical issues, and manually reviewed the
   reasons for retraction to select those papers that were indeed retracted
   due to the violation of scientific and technical ethical norms. We
   analyzed the retracted papers in terms of their publication date,
   retraction time, subject area, and country, and explored the patterns
   and characteristics. For the subject areas to which the papers belonged,
   more than 90\% of the papers were in the field of biomedical research.
   Based on the reasons for retraction marked in the database and the
   specific descriptions in the retraction notices, we refined the
   classification of the reasons for retraction, including 17 aspects in
   three categories, such as violation of ethical review, informed consent,
   and ethical consensus norms, and then summarized the common problems
   involving ethics in scientific and technical papers, wishing to alert
   researchers and provide reference for the governance of scientific and
   technical ethics. At the same time, based on the analysis result in this
   paper, we conclude that since 2000, the number of papers retracted due
   to ethical issues began to appear and gradually increased, reflecting
   the increased ethical awareness of the scientific community and the
   increased concern of the ethical compliance of the scientific research
   activities involved in the papers. China ranks third in the world in the
   number of papers retracted due to ethical issues with a total of 92
   papers. Comparing the retraction rates of papers due to ethical issues
   in China and the United States between 2011 and 2020, we also found that
   the rate is higher in China. The ethical governance of science and
   technology involves many complex factors such as social culture,
   regulations and policies, and scientific research integrity, etc. From
   this paper, we found that the failure to obtain prior approval from the
   ethics committee for relevant research is the most important reason for
   paper retractions, so the entry point of work is to strengthen the
   standardized ethical review of scientific and technological activities.
   In addition, we suggest that China needs to strengthen ethical research,
   raise ethical awareness, and popularize ethics education in order to
   actively participate in international ethical governance. Finally,
   actions in scientific research activities that are contrary to the
   ethical norms of science and technology should be investigated and
   handled in accordance with the relevant regulations.},

Abstract = {Plagiarism, the use of text and ideas from published works without
   proper permission or citation, is difficult to detect since the whole
   text should be searched and compared to literature databases.
   Nevertheless, this process has become simpler with the advent of
   web-based technologies and more powerful search tools. Recently, a case
   of plagiarism was detected in an invited manuscript submitted to the
   Journal of the Korean Medical Association. In the withdrawn manuscript,
   there were figures and figure legends copied from other papers with
   neither permission nor citation. Only the citation is enough to use
   content, figures, or tables from other papers when the original journal
   is open access with Creative Commons License. Otherwise, to use such
   data, it is essential to obtain permission from that paper's journal
   publisher. If plagiarism is detected after publication, the author will
   face harsh disciplinary action before the office of research integrity
   in his or her institute. Also, the paper may be retracted by the editor.
   This is the first time that Editorial Board has detected plagiarism
   before publication. Screening for plagiarism and other ethical
   violations will continue so that we can pursue the status of the
   representative journal of Korean physicians and develop a positive
   reputation for Korean science internationally by maintaining the utmost
   quality and integrity in our publications.},

Abstract = {We examined all 208 closed cases involving official findings of research
   misconduct published by the US Office of Research Integrity from 1992 to
   2011 to determine how often scientists mention in a retraction or
   correction notice that there was an ethical problem with an associated
   article. 75 of these cases cited at least one published article affected
   by misconduct for a total of 174 articles. For 127 of these 174, we
   found both the article and a retraction or correction statement. Since
   eight of the 127 published statements consisted of simply the word
   `retracted,' our analysis focused on the remaining 119 for which a more
   detailed retraction or correction was published. Of these 119
   statements, only 41.2\% mentioned ethics at all (and only 32.8\% named a
   specific ethical problem such as fabrication, falsification or
   plagiarism), whereas the other 58.8\% described the reason for
   retraction or correction as error, loss of data or replication failure
   when misconduct was actually at issue. Among the published statements in
   response to an official finding of misconduct (within the time frame
   studied), the proportion that mentioned ethics was significantly higher
   in recent years than in earlier years, as was the proportion that named
   a specific problem. To promote research integrity, scientific journals
   should consider adopting policies concerning retractions and corrections
   similar to the guidelines developed by the Committee on Publication
   Ethics. Funding agencies and institutions should take steps to ensure
   that articles affected by misconduct are retracted or corrected.},

Abstract = {The goal of most scientific research published in peer-review journals

   taken ironically, bibliographic database searches show that many have
   been subsequently cited as valid research, some in prestigious journals.
   We attempt to understand why so many readers cited such ironic science
   seriously. We draw from the literature on error propagation in research
   publication for ways categorize citations. We adopt the concept of irony
   from the fields of literary and rhetorical criticism to detect,
   characterize, and analyze the interpretations in the more than 60
   published research papers that cite an instance of ironic science. We
   find a variety of interpretations: some citing authors interpret the
   research as valid and accept it, some contradict or reject it, and some
   acknowledge its ironic nature. We conclude that publishing ironic
   science in a research journal can lead to the same troubles posed by
   retracted research, and we recommend relevant changes to publication

Abstract = {Publication of scientific paper is critical for modern science
   evolution, and professional advancement. However, it comes with many
   responsibilities. An author must be aware of good publication practices.
   While refraining from scientific misconduct or research frauds, authors
   should adhere to Good Publication Practices (GPP). Publications which
   draw conclusions from manipulated or fabricated data could prove
   detrimental to society and health care research. Good science can
   blossom only when research is conducted and documented with complete
   honesty and ethics. Unfortunately, publish or perish attitude has led to
   unethical practices in scientific research and publications. There is

Abstract = {In 2011, this journal published the paper `A Boltzmann transformation
   method for investigation of water vapour transport in building
   materials', proposing a dynamic measurement of building materials'
   vapour permeability via the Boltzmann-Matano method. This critique
   points out that this publication is flawed, since it proposes an invalid
   approach and presents erroneous results. The analysis first shows that
   the presented vapour permeability values cannot be reproduced and
   instead far lower vapour transport properties are obtained. These
   corrected outcomes are however also much below the dry-cup reference
   values, and it is established that these deviations stem from the
   invalidity of the proposed approach, due to disregarding the material's
   hygroscopicity. Given its erroneous results and invalid approach, it is
   finally recommended to have the paper officially retracted by the
   journal.},

Title = {An investigation into the impact and implications of published papers
   from retracted research: systematic search of affected literature},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective Analyses of the impact of a body of clinical trial reports
   subject to research misconduct have been few. Our objective was to
   examine the impact on clinically relevant research of a group of
   researchers' trial reports ('affected trial reports') affected by
   research misconduct, and whether identification of misconduct invoked a
   reappraisal.
   Design In 2016, we used five databases and search engines to identify
   `citing publications', that is, guidelines, systematic and other
   reviews, and clinical trials citing any of 12 affected trial reports,
   published 1998-2011, eventually retracted for research misconduct. The
   affected trial reports were assessed more likely to have had impact
   because they had hip fracture outcomes and were in journals with impact
   factor >4. Two authors assessed whether findings of the citing
   publications would change if the affected trial reports were removed. In
   2018, we searched for evidence that the citing publications had
   undertaken a reassessment as a result of the potential influence of the
   affected trial reports.
   Results By 2016 the affected trial reports were cited in 1158
   publications, including 68 systematic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative
   reviews, guidelines and clinical trials. We judged that 13 guidelines,
   systematic or other reviews would likely change their findings if the
   affected trial reports were removed, and in another eight it was unclear
   if findings would change. By 2018, only one of the 68 citing
   publications, a systematic review, appeared to have undertaken a
   reassessment, which led to a correction.
   Conclusions We found evidence that this group of affected trial reports
   distorted the evidence base. Correction of these distortions is slow,
   uncoordinated and inconsistent. Unless there is a rapid, systematic,
   coordinated approach by bibliographic databases, authors, journals and
   publishers to mitigate the impact of known cases of research misconduct,
   patients, other researchers and their funders may continue to be
   adversely affected.},

   as no surprise that ethics did not escape Dr Brumback's consideration.
   Reading Dr Brumback's vitae, I came across several publications that
   afford insights into topics that tugged at his moral fabric. Dr Brumback
   was a steadfast defender of the scientific method. Reading his
   commentaries, one gets the sense that Dr Brumback felt personally
   attacked when quackery challenged science. In addition, and as long-time
   Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child Neurology, Dr Brumback
   considered it a personal affront every time a paper he published, or for
   that matter published by any scientific journal, had to be retracted or
   corrected. In the following paragraphs, I review a selection of Dr
   Brumback's ethics writings.},

Abstract = {Background Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and
   is a rising issue for global health. Iran is struggling with a growing
   number of the elderly population and also a decrease in fertility rate.
   The goal of this study was to review and evaluate Alzheimer's disease
   publications by Iranian researchers.
   Methods We searched for Alzheimer and all its related keywords in the
   Web of Science to find related documents published by Iranian
   researchers from 2010 until 2019. Bibliometric parameters at the level
   of documents, authors, and organizations were assessed. The
   co-authorship matrix was computed using Bibexcel, and visualizations
   were performed by VOSviewer.
   Results Totally, 1042 documents from 4949 researchers (8.6 authors per
   document) were retrieved from Web of Science. Original articles
   (77.06\%) and reviews (16.21\%) were the most common document types for
   Iranian publications and also one article was retracted. As results, the
   average citation per document was 20.68. Iranian researchers mainly
   collaborated with researchers from the United States, Italy, Australia,
   and Canada, respectively. The co-occurrence networks for keywords
   represented five publication clusters in the collection. The largest
   cluster was related to studies on oxidative stress in Alzheimer's
   Disease, followed by in-vivo studies in the field of brain neurons
   destruction.
   Conclusion We found that Iranian researchers made significant impacts in
   the field of Alzheimer's disease and covered a wide range of related
   areas over the last 10 years.},

Abstract = {A publication in the August 2020 issue of the Journal of Vascular
   Surgery, ``Prevalence of unprofessional social media content among young
   vascular surgeons,{''} brought the concept of professionalism in the
   vascular surgery community to the forefront. In response to the
   methodology used in the article, and the definitions of professionalism,
   a global backlash from health care providers and lay people ensued. The
   article has since been retracted; however, its publication highlighted
   the need to reexamine current definitions and philosophies surrounding
   professionalism in medicine and surgery that may be discriminatory and
   exclusive. The term professionalism has no standard definition as
   evidenced by varying definitions among different societies and
   organizations. The lack of a structured, universally accepted definition
   of professionalism in the medical and surgical communities has resulted
   in no standard by which to measure the actions of physicians and
   surgeons. The definition of professionalism need not be complex and
   should not vary among specialties and societies. In its most simplistic
   form, the core definition of ``professionalism{''} embedded in the
   volumes of publications, guidelines, and charters that exist on the
   subject of professionalism in medicine is respect. We propose a tiered
   approach to define professionalism in medicine that builds on
   fundamental principles of respect and inclusivity, and includes
   actionable steps at three levels: (1) individual, (2) organizational,
   and (3) societal. Through this approach, any physician, regardless of
   specialty, practice type or location, can apply these concepts to ensure
   they consistently embody what it means to be ``professional.{''}},

Abstract = {COVID-19-related (vs. non-related) articles appear to be more
   expeditiously processed and published in peer-reviewed journals. We
   aimed to evaluate: (i) whether COVID-19-related preprints were favored
   for publication, (ii) preprinting trends and public discussion of the
   preprints, and (iii) the relationship between the publication topic
   (COVID-19-related or not) and quality issues. Manuscripts deposited at
   bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and September 27 2020 were
   assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals,
   and those published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time.
   The extent of public discussion was assessed based on Altmetric and
   Disqus data. The Retraction Watch Database and PubMed were used to
   explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and
   preprints. With adjustment for the preprinting server and number of
   deposited versions, COVID-19-related preprints were more likely to be
   published within 120 days since the deposition of the first version (OR
   = 1.96, 95\% CI: 1.80-2.14) as well as over the entire observed period
   (OR = 1.39, 95\% CI: 1.31-1.48). Submission-to-acceptance was by 35.85
   days (95\% CI: 32.25-39.45) shorter for COVID-19 articles. Public
   discussion of preprints was modest and COVID-19 articles were
   overrepresented in the pool of retracted articles in 2020. Current data
   suggest a preference for publication of COVID-19-related preprints over
   the observed period.},

Abstract = {The subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors comprising GPR4, OGR1,

   mediating biological responses to the lipid messengers
   sphingosylphosphoryleholine (SPC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and
   psychosine. We challenged this view by reporting that OGR1 and GPR4
   sense acidic pH and that this process is not affected by concentrations
   of SPC or LPC previously reported as agonistic. The original
   publications describing GPR4, OGR1, and G2A as receptors for LPC or SPC
   have now been retracted, and the first studies exploring receptors of
   this family as pH sensors in physiology have appeared. Here we review
   the status of this field and we confirm that GPR4, OGR1, and TDAG8
   should be considered as proton-sensing receptors. Negative regulation of
   these receptors by high micromolar concentrations of lipids appears not
   specific in our experiments.},

Title = {Ending the retraction stigma: Encouraging the reporting of errors in the

Journal = {RESEARCH ETHICS},

Volume = {17},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Retractions are on the rise as a result of a surge in post-publication
   peer review and an emboldened anonymous whistle-blowing movement.
   Cognizant that their brand may be damaged as a result of not correcting
   problematic literature, journals and publishers that are loosely
   considered to be non-{''}predatory{''} are trying to contain the deluge
   of reports on flawed research that has flooded the biomedical and
   scientific literature. Within this climate, many studies have started to
   be retracted and corrected, reinforcing the stigmatization associated
   with retractions, i.e., having a retraction is considered to be a bad or
   negative thing. Negative retraction stigmatization has mainly been borne
   by authors, whereas journals and publishers, except for
   headline-grabbing reports, have thus far largely avoided this stigma.
   One of the efforts to destigmatize retractions, at least those for
   honest errors, has been to try to relabel or rebrand retractions. The
   terms ``self-retraction{''}, ``amendment{''}, ``publisher-caused
   error{''}, and others have emerged, but such a diverse lexicon may
   complicate the publishing landscape more than it resolves the stigma.
   Seeking euphemistic terms to represent a truth within a toxic context of
   negative stigmatization only politicizes the issue, and does not resolve
   it. We suggest that a change is needed in the culture within the
   biomedical community, to acceptance of critique, and that the culture of
   shaming needs to be halted in order to achieve this. Only then can
   academics assume greater responsibility, without the risk of being
   shamed, of retracting their faulty literature, ``honestly{''}, when they
   feel that this is needed.},

   decision-making processes regarding authorship were further disclosed.
   Motivated by the scandal, we believe that this is one of the first
   empirical studies of questionable authorship practices (QAPs) in East
   Asian academia; we investigate Taiwanese researchers' perceptions of
   QAPs. To meet this purpose, a self-reported survey was developed. Four
   hundred and three local researchers, including research faculty (e.g.,
   professors), postdoctoral researchers, and Ph.D. students, participated
   in the survey. Four major findings resulted. First, the underlying
   causes of Taiwanese doctoral students' engagement in QAPs were
   attributable to their desire to achieve particular academic-related
   successes and their feeling of reciprocal obligation to support other
   researchers. Second, the underlying motives for Taiwanese research
   associates' (i.e., research faculty and postdoctoral fellows) engagement
   in QAPs were attributable to their attempts to achieve particular career
   successes and of the desire to consolidate their professional networks.
   Third, the participants generally agreed that QAPs had a long history
   among local academics but were rarely reported. Fourth, participants'
   backgrounds (i.e., research discipline, academic rank, and type of
   affiliations) had significant effects on their responses regarding
   particular authorship issues; however, their gender did not have a
   significant effect. QAPs are a critical issue in Taiwanese academia;
   therefore, we discussed the implications of the current findings
   including subsequent instruction and future research.},

Abstract = {Vareille M, Kieninger E, Alves MP, et al. Impaired type I and type III
   interferon induction and rhinovirus control in human cystic fibrosis
   airway epithelial cells. Thorax 2012;67:517-25. This article has been
   retracted. In our article recently published in Thorax, we described a
   novel mechanism explaining the increased susceptibility of patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) to rhinovirus infections, namely defective
   interferon type I and III production by CF airway epithelial cells. In
   experiments performed after publication of the article we were unable to
   consistently replicate our findings of deficient interferon type I and
   III production by CF airway epithelial cells upon rhinovirus infection.
   In the light of these results, we carried out detailed investigations of
   the data reported in the above manuscript and regrettably found evidence
   of deliberate manipulation of experimental data by the first author Dr
   M. Vareille. This manipulation was accompanied in some instances by
   absence of original data files. The manipulation/original data absence
   involved data presented in most, if not all of the figures, thus we wish
   to fully retract the paper and apologise to the readers of Thorax and to
   the scientific community for the inconvenience this has caused. We also
   checked data published by our group in manuscripts on which Dr Vareille
   was a co-author and found that data published in these manuscripts had
   not been manipulated. These two manuscripts, whose data and conclusions
   we stand by are: Edwards MR, Regamey N, Vareille M, et al. Impaired
   innate interferon induction in severe therapy resistant atopic asthmatic
   children. Mucosal Immunol 2013;6:797-806. doi: 10.1038/mi.2012.118. and

   inflammatory response on virus infection in cystic fibrosis. Eur Respir
   J 2012;39:297-304. doi: 10.1183/09031936.00054511. Dr. Vareille has
   received a letter from the Secretary General of the University of Bern
   condemning her scientific misconduct as a severe offence against the
   rules of scientific integrity. Her current employers have also been
   informed. All co-authors of the publication including Dr. Vareille

Abstract = {Coincident with the tsunami of COVID-19-related publications, there has
   been a surge of studies using real-world data, including those obtained
   from the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, several of these
   high-profile publications were retracted because of concerns regarding
   the soundness and quality of the studies and the EHR data they purported
   to analyze. These retractions highlight that although a small community
   of EHR informatics experts can readily identify strengths and flaws in
   EHR-derived studies, many medical editorial teams and otherwise
   sophisticated medical readers lack the framework to fully critically
   appraise these studies. In addition, conventional statistical analyses
   cannot overcome the need for an understanding of the opportunities and
   limitations of EHR-derived studies. We distill here from the broader
   informatics literature six key considerations that are crucial for
   appraising studies utilizing EHR data: data completeness, data
   collection and handling (eg, transformation), data type (ie, codified,
   textual), robustness of methods against EHR variability (within and
   across institutions, countries, and time), transparency of data and
   analytic code, and the multidisciplinary approach. These considerations
   will inform researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders as to the
   recommended best practices in reviewing manuscripts, grants, and other
   outputs from EHR-data derived studies, and thereby promote and foster
   rigor, quality, and reliability of this rapidly growing field.},

Title = {The landscape of urological retractions: the prevalence of reported
   research misconduct},
Journal = {BJU INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Number = {1},
Pages = {174-179},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the landscape of retractions of literature and to
   determine the prevalence of research misconduct in the field of urology.
   Methods Three databases (PUBMED, Embase, Retraction Watch) were queried
   for all retracted studies on urological topics in both urological and
   non-urological journals from April 1999 to March 2018. Two reviewers
   screened the records and determined the final list of articles to be
   included in the analysis. Results A total of 138 articles met the
   inclusion criteria. Over 80\% of retractions occurred after 2009.
   Retractions originated from 76 different journals (13 urological
   journals) and 28 countries. The most common reasons for retraction were
   plagiarism (28\%), fake peer review (20\%), error (20\%), and
   falsification of data (13\%). Misconduct accounted for two-thirds of the
   retractions (n = 93). A large watermark, indicating retraction of the
   article, was present in 75\% of the manuscripts. Articles were cited a
   total of 4454 times, 38\% of citations happened after retraction. The
   majority of retracted articles related to urological oncology (70\%).
   The highest number of retractions for an individual author was five.
   Rates of retraction among popular urological journals since 2010 have
   increased but remain a small proportion of all publications: BJUI,
   0.189\%; World Journal of Urology, 0.132\%; European Urology, 0.058\%;
   Urology, 0.047\%; and Journal of Urology, 0.024\%. Conclusion
   Retractions of urological literature, similarly to retractions of other
   biomedical literature, have been rising over the last decade. The
   majority of these retractions stem from research misconduct. Despite
   retractions, flawed articles continued to be cited.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BURN CARE \& RESEARCH},

Pages = {E691-E698},

Abstract = {Escharotomy incisions must be made in the inelastic skin eschar that is
   typical of circumferential third-degree burns. Later, the necrotic
   tissue must be debrided and substituted with a skin graft. Many reports
   on this topic have revealed that concepts and techniques vary widely.
   This study aims to present a critical review of the literature about
   escharotomy in burns and to highlight a different strategy to perform
   escharotomy in patients with burned extremities. We conducted a critical
   review in Pubmed/MEDLINE using the keywords ``escharotomy{''} and
   ``burns.{''} In the present study, we included 22 articles published
   from 1955 to 2015 (60 years) that contain the aforementioned keywords.
   With respect to the extremities, most of the publications recommend that
   medial and lateral longitudinal incisions be performed and that care
   must be taken to avoid deep structures, particularly nerves. Moreover,
   the publications mention that escharotomy might result in thick,
   hypertrophic, retracting, and painful scars. We advocate that incisions
   performed only on the lateral and medial borders of the extremities are
   usually unnecessary, and that they contribute to the creation of
   misconceptions about burns. In addition, these incisions can somehow
   trigger complications that can be avoided by using the concept of
   escharotomy in multiple directions, as highlighted in this review.},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {There is a growing realization that graduate education in the biomedical
   sciences is successful at teaching students how to conduct research but
   falls short in preparing them for a diverse job market, communicating
   with the public, and remaining versatile scientists throughout their
   careers. Major problems with graduate level education today include
   overspecialization in a narrow area of science without a proper
   grounding in essential critical thinking skills. Shortcomings in
   education may also contribute to some of the problems of the biomedical
   sciences, such as poor reproducibility, shoddy literature, and the rise
   in retracted publications. The challenge is to modify graduate programs
   such that they continue to generate individuals capable of conducting
   deep research while at the same time producing more broadly trained
   scientists without lengthening the time to a degree. Here we describe
   our first experiences at Johns Hopkins and propose a manifesto for
   reforming graduate science education.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present ReTracker, an open-source plugin for tracking
   retracted scientific journal articles. ReTracker helps Zotero users
   detect any papers in their current libraries that were retracted on
   PubMed. At its first release, ReTracker plugin adds metadata for each
   entry on its ``retraction status{''} as the plugin performs local cache
   checking and sends a query to the tool's database. If there is a match
   in the paper's full title between the query and ReTracker's database,
   the retraction status metadata will be updated. We believe that
   ReTracker, as an open-source, free tool, is a necessary solution that is
   distinctive from existing tools (e.g. Open Retractions, CrossMark,
   etc.), in that it enables researchers to manage their existing citation
   libraries without extra efforts to repetitively search for and manually
   flag retracted papers from external database(s). With future releases,
   the tool aims to expand its functionalities in terms of standardizing
   retraction tags, adding retraction data for other item types, and
   providing pop-up notices for web browser plugins.},

Abstract = {Scientific integrity is a learned skill. When researchers and students
   learn integrity in laboratories or in the classroom, they are empowered
   to use similar principles in other aspects of their lives. This
   commentary reviews the concepts related to scientific integrity at a
   time when science faces important challenges related to the increase
   number of articles produced regarding research on coronavirus disease
   2019 (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) has ignited another parallel viral pandemic, with science
   ranging from robust studies to dishonest studies being conducted,
   posted, and shared at an unprecedented rate. A balance is needed between
   the benefits of the rapid access to new scientific data and the threat
   of causing panic or erroneous clinical decisions based on mistakes or
   misconduct. The truth is that the ``scientific research has changed the
   world{''} but now, and more than ever, ``it needs to change itself{''}.
   A pandemic with a ``paperdemic{''} will be even more complicated to
   manage if it progresses in an uncontrolled manner and is not properly
   scrutinized.},

Title = {Characteristics of Retractions from Korean Medical Journals in the
   KoreaMed Database: A Bibliometric Analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Background
   Flawed or misleading articles may be retracted because of either honest
   scientific errors or scientific misconduct. This study explored the
   characteristics of retractions in medical journals published in Korea
   through the KoreaMed database.
   Methods
   We retrieved retraction articles indexed in the KoreaMed database from
   January 1990 to January 2016. Three authors each reviewed the details of
   the retractions including the reason for retraction, adherence to
   retraction guidelines, and appropriateness of retraction. Points of
   disagreement were reconciled by discussion among the three.
   Results
   Out of 217,839 articles in KoreaMed published from 1990 to January 2016,
   the publication type of 111 articles was retraction (0.051\%). Of the
   111 articles (addressing the retraction of 114 papers), 58.8\% were
   issued by the authors, 17.5\% were jointly issued (author, editor, and
   publisher), 15.8\% came from editors, and 4.4\% were dispatched by
   institutions; in 5.3\% of the instances, the issuer was unstated. The
   reasons for retraction included duplicate publication (57.0\%),
   plagiarism (8.8\%), scientific error (4.4\%), author dispute (3.5\%),
   and other (5.3\%); the reasons were unstated or unclear in 20.2\%. The
   degree of adherence to COPE's retraction guidelines varied
   (79.8\%-100\%), and some retractions were inappropriate by COPE
   standards. These were categorized as follows: retraction of the first
   published article in the case of duplicate publication (69.2\%),
   authorship dispute (15.4\%), errata (7.7\%), and other (7.7\%).
   Conclusion
   The major reason for retraction in Korean medical journals is duplicate
   publication. Some retractions resulted from overreaction by the editors.
   Therefore, editors of Korean medical journals should take careful note
   of the COPE retraction guidelines and should undergo training on
   appropriate retraction practices.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},

Month = {2022 JUN 29},
Abstract = {Scientific retraction practices are intended to help purge the continued
   use of flawed research and assist in maintaining the integrity,
   credibility and quality of scientific literature. However, the practical
   effect of retraction is still vague and needs to be further explored. In
   this study, we analysed the citation counts and sentiments
   (positive/negative) of retracted articles in psychology journals from
   Web of Science to explore the effect of retraction. Causal inference
   strategies were used to measure the net effect of retractions on
   citation. Results show that the retraction practices induced the
   citation counts to reduce as expected. However, the proportion of
   negative citations also decreased because of retraction, indicating an
   unsatisfied effect. The retraction practice of high-impact factors and
   open access journals was more effective than other journals. The study
   integrated an understanding of the dissemination of erroneous
   publications and provided implications for liabilities involved in the
   whole retraction process.},

Abstract = {Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is the infectious disease caused by
   the recently discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. This new virus and
   disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in
   December 2019. The number of publications with regard to
   COVID-19-related information is exponentially increasing, but there are
   also some retracted papers appearing on PubMed, including those
   retracted from The Lancet Global Health and the New England Journal of
   Medicine. In a PubMed search for ``COVID,{''} there were 1595 articles
   by April 1, 2020. As of June 30, the number of articles has now reached
   25,913.
   In this editorial, 4 specific areas of information are looked at but the
   principles apply to many other areas of medicine. The specifics looked
   at are PPE for tracheostomy, testing for COVID-19, pregnancy and
   COVID-19, and surgical expectations during redeployment.
   We must make no mistake that we are seeing a disease that modern
   medicine has never encountered before.
   This article is not aimed at belittling or dismissing any of the advice
   of the Royal Colleges' or PHE advice, but it demonstrates the tsunami of
   information and the ambiguity that surgeons are experiencing throughout
   the UK right now.
   This is unlikely to be the end of progression regarding healthcare
   planning and development for unencountered viruses9. In the next few
   months and beyond, there are likely to be adaptions and revisions of
   more documents advising on various aspects of healthcare with regard to
   COVID-19 management and for possible future viruses not yet seen by the
   modern world before. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

   on December 27, 2018. After the e-publication of the article, the editor
   received an email from the corresponding author on January 14, 2019
   requesting ``to withdraw the above-mentioned manuscript for further
   consideration, due to a technical reason (we have done a further

   Though it is unclear why the authors were not able to determine these

   the authors did not ensure integrity in conducting and reporting their
   research activities. The bibliometric information of 4716 document
   categorised as retractions in Science Citation Index, Web of Science was
   downloaded and analysed to understand trend, pattern and reasons of
   retraction. The results showed that retractions had increased during the
   ten-year period, 2008-2017. The main reasons for retractions were
   plagiarism, falsified data, manipulation of images and figures. It was
   also found that just 40 out of 4716 retraction notices had explicitly
   stated reasons for retracting the published articles. The open access
   journals had more number of retractions as compared to subscription
   based journals. The study will guide library professionals and research
   scholars towards a better comprehension of the reasons behind
   retractions in science discipline in the ten-year period. They would be
   better equipped to steer clear of inauthentic publications in their
   citations and references.},

Abstract = {Plagiarism represents a serious and growing problem in science, with
   only a fraction of such publications detected and retracted. Any
   initiative to deal efficiently with the problem of plagiarism would
   require a joint effort of academic publishers and editors. The most
   effective measure would be to establish a common plagiarism detection
   system, adopted by all peer-reviewed journals and major publishers, with
   automatic uploading and cross-checking of each newly submitted
   manuscript with both published material and all further and ongoing
   submissions. If adequately implemented, such system would fully resolve
   the problem of multiple submissions, and detect instances of plagiarism
   of unpublished material. Significant portion of scientific misconduct
   cases would be resolved, in most cases much before the publishing stage.
   This would greatly benefit the scientific community and science in
   general. The need for publishing retraction notices would be also
   diminished, thereby reducing the publishing costs. Lastly, the system
   would probably act as a deterrent, passively contributing to plagiarism
   frequency reduction.},

Abstract = {In 1998, a Lancet paper described 12 cases of children with autism, and
   having been vaccinated (MMR) in the United Kingdom; medias presented the
   information to the lay public, stating that a link was possible.
   In 2004, The Lancet published letters responding to allegations against
   the paper.
   Later, it was established that no link existed between MMR and autism;
   few years and many publications were necessary to conclude to the
   absence of evidence.
   In 2010, the General Medical Council published a report against Dr
   Wakefield, first author of the 1998 paper, and showing that the children
   hospital records did not contain the evidence; hospital records differed
   from the published paper; the Lancet retracted the 1998 paper.
   In 2011, Brian Deer, a journalist, published the complete story in the
   BMJ: in 1996, Wakefield was approached by lawyers representing on
   anti-vaccine lobby, and they supported the Wakefield research.
   Dr Wakefield left England; in 2012 he works in Texas, USA, for

Title = {False remembering in real life: James Ost's contributions to memory
   psychology},
Journal = {MEMORY},

Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {661-668},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {This special issue honours James Ost's (1973-2019) contributions to our
   understanding of false and distorted remembering. In our editorial, we
   introduce some of James' distinctive research themes including the
   experiences of people who retract ``recovered{''} memories, social
   (e.g., co-witness and interviewer influence) and personality influences
   on false remembering, the nature of false remembering itself (e.g.,
   different types of false memories; false memories vs. false beliefs),
   public understanding of (false) memory, and a historical link to the
   work of Frederic Bartlett. We illustrate these themes through a number
   of key publications. The unifying thread behind James' work is his core
   interest in false/distorted remembering in real-life (typically
   high-stake) situations, in line with his engagement with the British

Title = {Issues of methods and interpretation in the National Cancer Institute
   formaldehyde cohort study COMMENT},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {In 2004, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
   reclassified formaldehyde (FA) from a probable (Group 2A) to a known
   human carcinogen (Group 1) citing results for nasopharyngeal cancer
   (NPC) mortality from the follow-up through 1994 of the National Cancer
   Institute formaldehyde cohort study. To the contrary, in 2012, the
   Committee for Risk Assessment of the European Chemicals Agency disagreed
   with the proposal to classify FA as a known human carcinogen (Carc. 1A),
   proposing a lower but still protective category, namely as a substance
   which is presumed to have carcinogenic potential for humans (Carc. 1B).
   Thus, U.S. and European regulatory agencies currently disagree about the
   potential human carcinogenicity of FA. In 2013, the National Cancer
   Institute reported results from their follow-up through 2004 of the
   formaldehyde cohort and concluded that the results continue to suggest a
   link between FA exposure and NPC. We discuss in this commentary why we
   believe that this interpretation is neither consistent with the
   available data from the most recent update of the National Cancer
   Institute cohort study nor with other research findings from that
   cohort, other large cohort studies and the series of publications by
   some of the current authors, including an independent study of one of
   the National Cancer Institute's study plants.
   Another serious concern relates to the incorrectness of the data from
   the follow-up through 1994 of the National Cancer Institute study
   stemming from incomplete mortality ascertainment. While these data were
   corrected by the National Cancer Institute in subsequent supplemental
   publications, incorrect data from the original publications have been
   cited extensively in recent causal evaluations of FA, including IARC. We
   conclude that the NCI publications that contain incorrect data from the
   incomplete 1994 mortality follow-up should be retracted entirely or
   corrected via published errata in the corresponding journals, and
   efforts should be made to re-analyze data from the 2004 follow-up of the
   NCI cohort study.},

Title = {Misconduct Policies, Academic Culture and Career Stage, Not Gender or
   Pressures to Publish, Affect Scientific Integrity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {The honesty and integrity of scientists is widely believed to be
   threatened by pressures to publish, unsupportive research environments,
   and other structural, sociological and psychological factors. Belief in
   the importance of these factors has inspired major policy initiatives,
   but evidence to support them is either non-existent or derived from
   self-reports and other sources that have known limitations. We used a
   retrospective study design to verify whether risk factors for scientific
   misconduct could predict the occurrence of retractions, which are
   usually the consequence of research misconduct, or corrections, which
   are honest rectifications of minor mistakes. Bibliographic and personal
   information were collected on all co-authors of papers that have been
   retracted or corrected in 2010-2011 (N=611 and N=2226 papers,
   respectively) and authors of control papers matched by journal and issue
   (N=1181 and N=4285 papers, respectively), and were analysed with
   conditional logistic regression. Results, which avoided several
   limitations of past studies and are robust to different sampling
   strategies, support the notion that scientific misconduct is more likely
   in countries that lack research integrity policies, in countries where
   individual publication performance is rewarded with cash, in cultures
   and situations were mutual criticism is hampered, and in the earliest
   phases of a researcher's career. The hypothesis that males might be
   prone to scientific misconduct was not supported, and the widespread
   belief that pressures to publish are a major driver of misconduct was
   largely contradicted: high-impact and productive researchers, and those
   working in countries in which pressures to publish are believed to be
   higher, are less-likely to produce retracted papers, and more likely to
   correct them. Efforts to reduce and prevent misconduct, therefore, might
   be most effective if focused on promoting research integrity policies,
   improving mentoring and training, and encouraging transparent
   communication amongst researchers.},

Volume = {122},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly
   recommended the use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) in
   adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia to reduce the risk of
   surgical site infection (SSI). Since then, further trials have been
   published, trials included previously have come under scrutiny, and one
   article was retracted. We updated the systematic review on which the
   recommendation was based.
   Methods: We performed a systematic literature search from January 1990
   to April 2018 for RCTs comparing the effect of high (80\%) vs standard
   (30-35\%) FiO(2) on the incidence of SSI. Studies retracted or under
   investigation were excluded. A random effects model was used for
   meta-analyses; the sources of heterogeneity were explored using
   meta-regression.
   Results: Of 21 RCTs included, six were newly identified since the
   publication of the WHO guideline review; 17 could be included in the
   final analyses. Overall, no evidence for a reduction of SSI after the
   use of high FiO(2) was found {[}relative risk (RR): 0.89; 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.07]. There was evidence that high
   FiO(2) was beneficial in intubated patients {[}RR: 0.80 (95\% CI:
   0.64-0.99)], but not in non-intubated patients {[}RR: 1.20 (95\% CI:
   0.91-1.58); test of interaction; P = 0.048].
   Conclusions: The WHO updated analyses did not show definite beneficial
   effect of the use of high perioperative FiO(2), overall, but there was
   evidence of effect of reducing the SSI risk in surgical patients under
   general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation. However, the evidence for
   this beneficial effect has become weaker and the strength of the
   recommendation needs to be reconsidered.},

Title = {Misconduct, Marginality and Editorial Practices in Management, Business
   and Economics Journals},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Objectives
   The paper presents data on the two problems of misconduct and
   marginality in management, business and economics (MBE) journals and
   their practices to combat these problems.
   Design
   Data was collected in three phases. First, all publicly retracted papers
   in MBE journals were identified through keywords searches in 7 major
   databases (n = 1329 journals). Second, a focused survey was distributed
   to editors involved in such retractions (n = 64; response rate = 28\%).
   Finally, a survey was administered to all active journals in the seven
   databases to collect data on editors' perceptions and practices related
   to the two problems (n = 937, response rate = 31.8\%). Frequency
   analyses, cross tabulations, and qualitative analyses of open answers
   were used to examine the data.
   Results
   184 retracted papers in MBE journals were identified in 2005-2015 (no
   retraction was found before 2005). From 2005-2007 to 2012-2015, the
   number of retractions increased by a factor ten with an all-time high in
   2015. The survey to journals with reported retractions illustrates how
   already a few cases of suspected misconduct put a strain on the
   editorial workload. The survey to all active journals revealed that 42\%
   of the respondents had started to use software to screen all submitted
   papers, and that a majority recognized the problem of marginality, as
   indicated by salami-style submissions. According to some editors,
   reviewers easily spot such submissions whereas others argued that
   authors may submit thinly sliced papers in parallel to several journals,
   which means that this practice is only discovered post-publication. The
   survey question on ways to support creative contributions stimulated a
   rich response of ideas regarding editorial vision, engaged boards and
   developmental approaches. The study uses data from three specialized
   fields, but its findings may be highly relevant to many journals in the
   social sciences.},

   limitations of manual verification of nucleotide sequences, we developed
   a semi-automated fact checking tool, Seek \& Blastn, to verify the
   targeting or non-targeting status of published nucleotide sequence
   reagents. From previously described and unknown corpora of 48 and 155
   publications, respectively, Seek \& Blastn correctly extracted 304/342
   (88.9\%) and 1066/1522 (70.0\%) nucleotide sequences and a predicted
   targeting/non-targeting status. Seek \& Blastn correctly predicted the
   targeting/non-targeting status of 293/304 (96.4\%) and 988/1066 (92.7\%)
   of the correctly extracted nucleotide sequences. A total of 38/39
   (97.4\%) or 31/79 (39.2\%) Seek \& Blastn predictions of incorrect
   nucleotide sequence reagent use were correct in the two literature
   corpora. Combined Seek \& Blastn and manual analyses identified a list
   of 91 misidentified nucleotide sequence reagents, which could be built
   upon through future studies. In summary, incorrect nucleotide sequence
   reagents represent an under-recognized source of error within the
   biomedical literature, and fact checking tools such as Seek \& Blastn
   may help to identify papers and manuscripts affected by these errors.},

Abstract = {Several widely publicized incidents of academic research misconduct,
   combined with the politicization of the role of science in public health
   and policy discourse (e.g., COVID, immunizations) threaten to undermine
   faith in the integrity of empirical research. Researchers often maintain
   that peer-review and study replication allow the field to self-police
   and self-correct; however, stark disparities between official reports of
   academic research misconduct and self-reports of academic researchers,
   specifically with regard to data fabrication, belie this argument.
   Further, systemic imperatives in academic settings often incentivize
   institutional responses that focus on minimizing reputational harm
   rather than the impact of fabricated data on the integrity of extant and
   future research.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Following the Second World War, Adorno et al.'s The Authoritarian
   Personality (1950/2019) became the most influential engagement between
   Frankfurt School critical theorists and the field of psychology. The
   recent publication of Adorno's retracted ``Remarks on The Authoritarian
   Personality{''} (2019) provides a timely impetus to reexamine and
   challenge certain long-held ideas about Adorno's contribution to
   psychology-for instance that The Authoritarian Personality reduces
   complex social phenomena to individual motivation and personality.
   Adorno's Remarks provide an alternative approach to the usual reading of
   The Authoritarian Personality, where the psychology of authoritarianism
   points to a contradiction at the very core of the concept of psychology,
   aligning the study with Adorno's more critical and dialectical works. In
   this article, I challenge how Adorno and The Authoritarian Personality
   are commonly taken up in critical psychology and introduce ``negative
   psychology{''} as Adorno's central contribution to the field modeled in
   his reading of psychoanalysis and his theory of negative dialectics.
   Reframed in this way, Adorno can continue to serve as a crucial site of
   critical engagement for psychologists.},

   Table1 contains clinical data described in the paper as being derived
   from a cohort of asthma patients. However, the provenance of this data
   is unclear. Based on the evidence available, the University of Dundee
   investigation concluded that the majority of the patient cohort is
   likely to be a subset of a cohort of cystic fibrosis patients reported
   in PLoS One 8(12): e82432 (), although in a number of cases the
   patient's gender is at odds between the two reports. The RNAseq data are
   unavailable on the European Nucleotide Archive under the reported
   accession number ERG003569. RNAseq data were uploaded with accession
   number ERS654066 before publication. The paper describes use of both
   prednisolone and prednisone, yet only the latter was used in the study.},

Title = {Quantifying the effect of Wakefield et al. (1998) on skepticism about
   MMR vaccine safety in the US},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Background Efforts to trace the rise of childhood vaccine safety
   concerns in the US often suggest Andrew Wakefield and colleagues'
   retracted 1998 Lancet study (AW98)-which alleged that the MMR vaccine
   can cause children to develop autism-as a primary cause of US vaccine
   skepticism. However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety
   collected before/after AW98's publication obscures whether anecdotal
   accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect. Methods We
   address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study
   change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990-2019) from
   the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern
   about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for
   the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment
   analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996-2000) in major
   television and newspaper outlets. Results AW98 led to an immediate
   increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across
   six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 {[}52.19,
   88.75], p < 0.01). Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of
   negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98's
   publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect =
   9.59\% {[}3.66, 15.51], p < 0.01). Conclusions Vaccine skepticism
   increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made
   possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR. Significance
   Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to
   widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health
   policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the
   previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions
   that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can
   undermine public confidence in vaccines. We conclude by offering several
   recommendations that researchers and health communicators might consider
   to detect and address future threats to vaccine confidence.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Number = {7758},
Pages = {649+},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {About 800 million people depend in part on meltwater from the thousands
   of glaciers in the high mountains of Asia. Water stress makes this
   region vulnerable to drought, but glaciers are a uniquely
   drought-resilient source of water. Here I show that seasonal glacier
   meltwater is equivalent to the basic needs of 221 +/- 59 million people,
   or most of the annual municipal and industrial needs of Pakistan,
   Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. During
   drought summers, meltwater dominates water inputs to the upper Indus,
   Aral and Chu/Issyk-Kul river basins. This reduces the risk of social
   instability, conflict and sudden migrations triggered by water scarcity,
   which is already associated with the large, rapidly growing populations
   and hydro-economies of these basins. Regional meltwater production is,
   however, unsustainably high-at 1.6 times the balance rate-and is
   expected to increase in future decades before ultimately declining.
   These results update and reinforce a previous publication in Nature on
   this topic, which was retracted after an inadvertent error was
   discovered.},

Abstract = {In April 2022, a first-year PhD student published his first
   peer-reviewed article in the journal Qualitative Research. Less than
   four months later, amid viral public outrage, that article, Karl
   Andersson's ``I am not alone - we are all alone: Using masturbation as
   an ethnographic method in research on shota subculture in Japan,{''} was
   removed from publication and formally retracted by the Journal Editors.
   This paper explores the controversy surrounding the so-called
   ``masturbation article{''} and its relevance to the field of publishing
   studies. I begin with a general overview of the shota manga genre and
   its legal context and provide a factual short history of the affair. I
   then demonstrate what a good-faith positive peer review of Andersson's
   article may have included and critically assess Qualitative Research's
   Retraction Notice, alongside other published ethical complaints. I
   conclude by showing how both Andersson's article and the Japanese manga
   he studies have been censored for the same reasons, with troubling
   implications for freedom of speech in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {In their recent Angewandte Chemie publication (doi:
   10.1002/anie.202112063), Cen, Wang, Zhou et al. reported the crystal
   structure of a ternary complex of the non-heme iron endoperoxidase
   FtmOx1 (PDB entry 7ETK). The biochemical data assessed in this study
   were from a retracted study (doi: 10.1038/nature15519) by Zhang, Liu,
   Zhang et al.; no additional biochemical data were included, yet there
   was no discussion on the source of the biochemical data in the report by
   Cen, Wang, Zhou et al. Based on this new crystal structure and
   subsequent QM/MM-MD calculations, Cen, Wang, Zhou et al. concluded that
   their work provided evidence supporting the CarC-like mechanistic model
   for FtmOx1 catalysis. However, the authors did not accurately describe
   either the CarC-like model or the COX-like model, and they did not
   address the differences between them. Further, and contrary to their
   interpretations in the manuscript, the authors' data are consistent with
   the COX-like model once the details of the CarC-like and COX-like models
   have been carefully analyzed.},

Abstract = {In June 2019, the journal PLoS ONE retracted an original research
   article, published in 2016, which described the effects of homeopathic
   Arnica montana on interleukin-4 treated human macrophages. The results
   showed an increase in extracellular matrix gene expression, including
   the gene encoding fibronectin, which is one of the main proteins
   involved in connective tissue healing. Here, the authors of the article
   discuss the critical points raised by the journal in the retraction
   note, with a focus on the specific methodological aspects of research on
   high dilutions of natural compounds. The editorial arguments made to
   justify the retraction did not prove any methodological errors, nor
   scientific misconduct. As a general rule, when a study published by a
   group of researchers raises scientific doubts because the results appear
   at variation with the commonly accepted knowledge in a field, the study
   is repeated by other scholars and any contrasting results are published
   and/or discussed. Therefore, retraction of the Arnica m. study by PLoS
   ONE is a violation of the conventions of scientific publication and
   knowledge-sharing methods derived from honest experimental method.},

Abstract = {In this issue, Beaumont et al report cancer mortality rates associated
   with exposure to high concentrations of hexavalent chromium in well
   water in Liaoning Province, China. Contamination of drinking water at
   these levels has been reported only once before, among a small group in
   Mexico. The investigation in China is a convoluted tale. The first
   report indicated an increase in cancer mortality, while a subsequent
   publication with the same lead author claimed no increased risks. In
   2006, the journal publishing the latter paper retracted it because of
   failure to disclose financial and intellectual input to the paper by
   outside parties (linked to chromium polluting industries). Beaumont and
   his colleagues now provide a further reanalysis of these data, showing
   increased mortality in particular from stomach cancer, but with serious
   limitations in the data and methods of analysis. These limitations are
   counterbalanced by the importance of a study of perhaps the highest
   exposure to hexavalent chromium in water that will ever be experienced
   by a population large enough to estimate risks of cancer.},

Abstract = {Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous
   publications of imaging findings in children have surfaced in a very
   short time. Publications discuss populations of overlapping age groups
   and describe different imaging patterns. We aim to present an overview
   of the quantity and type of literature available regarding COVID-19
   chest imaging findings in children according to a 2020 publication
   timeline. We conducted a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We
   searched terminology related to COVID-19, chest, children and imaging
   modalities in PubMed and Embase. The included papers were published
   online in 2020 and described imaging findings specific to children and
   reported five or more cases. Two researchers reviewed each abstract to
   determine inclusion or exclusion, and a radiologist reconciled any
   disagreements. Then we reviewed full articles for the main analysis.
   Eligible study designs included original articles, case series (>= 5
   cases), systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We excluded non-English
   manuscripts, retracted articles, and those without available full text.
   The remaining articles were distributed to four pediatric radiologists
   (on the Society for Pediatric Radiology Thoracic Committee), who
   summarized chest imaging findings. Eighty-two articles were included in
   the final analysis - 28\% in radiology journals and 71\% in
   non-radiology journals; 71\% contained original data and 29\% were
   review-style papers. There was a disproportionate contribution of
   review-style papers in April (55\%), considering the paucity of
   preceding publications with original data in March (5 papers). June had
   the highest number of publications (n=14), followed by April (n=11) and
   July (n=11). Most (52\%) original papers were from China and most
   individual pediatric imaging descriptions were from China (57\%), while
   the majority of review papers (83\%) were international. Imaging
   descriptions were available for 2,199 children (1,678 CT descriptions
   and 780 chest radiography descriptions). Findings included a 25\% normal
   CT scan reports vs. 40\% normal chest radiography reports. Ground-glass
   opacification was the most common CT finding (33\%) and was reported in
   only a minority of chest radiographs (9\%). A significant amount of
   information on pediatric COVID-19 chest imaging has become rapidly
   available over a short period. Most publications in 2020 were original
   articles, but they were published more often in non-radiology journals.
   A disproportionate number of review articles were published early on and
   were based on little original pediatric imaging data. CT scan reports,
   which represent the standard, outnumbered radiographic reports and
   indicated that ground-glass opacification is the main imaging finding
   and that only a quarter of scans are normal in children with COVID-19.},

Title = {Evidence for non-random sampling in randomised, controlled trials by
   Yuhji Saitoh},
Journal = {ANAESTHESIA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {72},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-27},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A large number of randomised trials authored by Yoshitaka Fujii have
   been retracted, in part as a consequence of a previous analysis finding
   a very low probability of random sampling. Dr Yuhji Saitoh co-authored
   34 of those trials and he was corresponding author for eight of them. We
   found a number of additional randomised, controlled trials that included
   baseline data, with Saitoh as corresponding author, that Fujii did not
   co-author. We used Monte Carlo simulations to analyse the baseline data
   from 32 relevant trials in total as well as an outcome (muscle twitch
   recovery ratios) reported in several. We also compared a series of
   muscle twitch recovery graphs appearing in a number of Saitoh's
   publications. The baseline data in 14/32 randomised, controlled trials
   had p < 0.01, of which seven p values were < 0.001. Eight trials
   reported four ratios of the time for the return of muscle activity after
   neuromuscular blockade, the distributions of which were homogeneous: the
   p values for the observed Q statistics were 0.0055, 0.031, 0.016 and
   0.0071. Comparison of graphs revealed multiple coincident or
   near-coincident curves across a large number of publications, a finding
   also inconsistent with random sampling. Combining the continuous and
   categorical probabilities of the 32 included trials, we found a very low
   likelihood of random sampling: p = 1.27 9 10(-8) (1 in 100,000,000). The
   high probability of non-random sampling and the repetition of lines in
   multiple graphs suggest that further scrutiny of Saitoh's work is
   warranted.},

Title = {Published analysis of contraceptive effectiveness of Daysy and DaysyView
   app is fatally flawed},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Background: In March 2018, Dr. Martin C. Koch and colleagues published
   an analysis purporting to measure the effectiveness of the Daysy device
   and DaysyView app for the prevention of unintended pregnancy.
   Unfortunately, the analysis was flawed in multiple ways which render the
   estimates unreliable. Unreliable estimates of contraceptive
   effectiveness can endanger public health.
   Main body: This commentary details multiple concerns pertaining to the
   collection and analysis of data in Koch et al. 2018. A key concern
   pertains to the inappropriate exclusion of all women with fewer than 13
   cycles of use from the Pearl Index calculations, which has no basis in
   standard effectiveness calculations. Multiple additional methodological
   concerns, as well as prior attempts to directly convey concerns to the
   manufacturer regarding marketing materials based on prior inaccurate
   analyses, are also discussed.
   Conclusion: The Koch et al. 2018 publication produced unreliable
   estimates of contraceptive effectiveness for the Daysy device and
   DaysyView app, which are likely substantially higher than the actual
   contraceptive effectiveness of the device and app. Those estimates are
   being used in marketing materials which may inappropriately inflate
   consumer confidence and leave consumers more vulnerable than expected to
   the risk of unintended pregnancy. Prior attempts to directly convey
   concerns to the manufacturer of this device were unsuccessful in
   preventing publication of subsequent inaccurate analyses. To protect
   public health, concerns with this analysis should be documented in the
   published literature, the Koch et al. 2018 analysis should be retracted,
   and marketing materials on contraceptive effectiveness should be
   subjected to appropriate oversight.},

Title = {Detect, correct, retract: How to manage incorrect structural models},
Journal = {FEBS JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {285},
Number = {3},
Pages = {444-466},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The massive technical and computational progress of biomolecular
   crystallography has generated some adverse side effects. Most crystal
   structure models, produced by crystallographers or well-trained
   structural biologists, constitute useful sources of information, but
   occasional extreme outliers remind us that the process of structure
   determination is not fail-safe. The occurrence of severe errors or gross
   misinterpretations raises fundamental questions: Why do such aberrations
   emerge in the first place? How did they evade the sophisticated
   validation procedures which often produce clear and dire warnings, and
   why were severe errors not noticed by the depositors themselves, their
   supervisors, referees and editors? Once detected, what can be done to
   either correct, improve or eliminate such models? How do incorrect
   models affect the underlying claims or biomedical hypotheses they were
   intended, but failed, to support? What is the long-range effect of the
   propagation of such errors? And finally, what mechanisms can be
   envisioned to restore the validity of the scientific record and, if
   necessary, retract publications that are clearly invalidated by the lack
   of experimental evidence? We suggest that cognitive bias and flawed
   epistemology are likely at the root of the problem. By using examples
   from the published literature and from public repositories such as the
   Protein Data Bank, we provide case summaries to guide correction or
   improvement of structural models. When strong claims are unsustainable
   because of a deficient crystallographic model, removal of such a model
   and even retraction of the affected publication are necessary to restore
   the integrity of the scientific record.},

Title = {Testing scientific software: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {56},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1219-1232},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Context: Scientific software plays an important role in critical
   decision making, for example making weather predictions based on climate
   models, and computation of evidence for research publications. Recently,
   scientists have had to retract publications due to errors caused by
   software faults. Systematic testing can identify such faults in code.
   Objective: This study aims to identify specific challenges, proposed
   solutions, and unsolved problems faced when testing scientific software.
   Method: We conducted a systematic literature survey to identify and
   analyze relevant literature. We identified 62 studies that provided
   relevant information about testing scientific software.
   Results: We found that challenges faced when testing scientific software
   fall into two main categories: (1) testing challenges that occur due to
   characteristics of scientific software such as oracle problems and (2)
   testing challenges that occur due to cultural differences between
   scientists and the software engineering community such as viewing the
   code and the model that it implements as inseparable entities. In
   addition, we identified methods to potentially overcome these challenges
   and their limitations. Finally we describe unsolved challenges and how
   software engineering researchers and practitioners can help to overcome
   them.
   Conclusions: Scientific software presents special challenges for
   testing. Specifically, cultural differences between scientist developers
   and software engineers, along with the characteristics of the scientific
   software make testing more difficult. Existing techniques such as code
   clone detection can help to improve the testing process. Software
   engineers should consider special challenges posed by scientific
   software such as oracle problems when developing testing techniques. (C)

Title = {Assessing the impact of retraction on the citation of randomized

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH \& POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives To assess the impact of retraction on the citation of
   randomized controlled trials. Methods We used an interrupted time-series
   with matched controls. PubMed, CINHAL, Google and the Retraction Watch
   Database were searched. We identified retracted publications reporting
   the results of randomized controlled trials involving human participants
   with two years of available data before and after retraction. We
   obtained monthly citation counts across all articles for the 24 months
   before and after retraction, from Web of Science. We used a Poisson
   segmented regression to detect changes in the level and trend of
   citation following retraction. We also undertook a matched control
   analysis of unretracted randomized controlled trials and a sensitivity
   analysis to account for cases of large-scale, well-advertised fraud.
   Results We identified 387 retracted randomized controlled trial reports,
   of which 218 (56.3\%) were included in the interrupted time-series
   analysis. A reduction of 22.9\% (95\% CI 4.0\% to 38.2\%, p = 0.02) was
   observed in the number of citations in the month after retraction, and a
   further reduction of 1.9\% (95\% CI 0.4\% to 3.5\%, p = 0.02) per month
   in the following 24 months, relative to the expected trend. There was no
   evidence of a statistically significant reduction among the matched
   controls. Authors with a large number of retractions saw a 48.2\%
   reduction at the time of retraction (95\% CI 17.7\% to 67.3\%, p =
   0.01). Other cases had a more gradual reduction with no change at the
   time of retraction and a 1.8\% reduction per month in the following 24
   months (95\% CI 0.2\% to 3.4\%, p = 0.03). Conclusions Retractions of
   randomized controlled trial reports can be effective in reducing
   citations. Other factors, such as the scale of the retractions and media
   attention, may play a role in the effectiveness of the reduction.},

Title = {Agency and responsibility: A linguistic analysis of culpable acts in
   retraction notices},
Journal = {LINGUA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {247},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Informed by image repair theory, this study examines grammatical
   resources used to represent agents of retraction-engendering acts in
   retraction notices (RNs). A corpus of 250 RNs from two broad
   disciplinary groupings and authored by different stakeholders was
   analyzed to determine if agents of retraction-engendering acts were
   identified and how linguistically visible they were made. It was found
   that agents of culpable acts were identified in only 44.40\% of the RNs
   and that agent-obscuring grammatical resources were deployed about 3.35
   times more frequently than agent-identifying ones were. Furthermore, the
   hard-discipline RNs authored by journal authorities identified agents of
   culpable acts significantly less frequently and less explicitly than
   both the hard-discipline RNs from authors of retracted publications and
   the soft-discipline RNs written by journal authorities did. These
   results suggest that choices of grammatical resources in RNs are
   influenced by a complex web of factors, including different retraction
   stakeholders' varied communicative purposes, their image repair efforts,
   their relation to the reprehensible acts, and legal considerations.
   These findings warrant further attention to language use in RNs as a
   high-stakes genre. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   `Genome Announcements'?},
Journal = {MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 22},
Abstract = {When comparing the requirements of diverse journals to publish microbial
   `Genome Reports,' we noticed that some mostly focus on benchmarking
   universal single-copy orthologs scores as a qualitymeasure, while the
   exclusion of possible contaminating sequences from genomic resources and
   the possible misidentification of the target microbes receive less
   attention. To deal with these quality issues, we suggest that DNA
   barcodes that are widely accepted for the identification of the target
   microbe species should be extracted from newly reported genome resources
   and included in phylogenetic analyses to confirm the identity of the
   sequenced microorganisms before Genome Reports are published. This
   approach, applied, for example, by the journal IMA Fungus, largely
   prevents the misidentification of the microbes that are targeted for
   whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In addition, contig similarity values,
   including GC content, remapping coverage ofWGSreads, and BLASTN searches
   against the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide
   database, would also reveal contamination issues. The values of these
   two recommendations to improve the publication criteria for microbial
   Genome Reports in diverse journals are demonstrated here through
   analyses of a draft genome published in Molecular Plant-Microbe
   Interactions and then retracted due to contaminations.},

Title = {Construction and management of retraction stigma in retraction notices:
   an authorship-based investigation},
Journal = {CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 2},
Abstract = {Although retraction is widely perceived as stigmatic in the scientific
   community, little is known about how retraction stigma is communicated
   via retraction notices. Drawing on a dataset of 1,000 retraction
   notices, this study investigated what communication strategies were
   employed in retraction notices to construct and manage retraction stigma
   and whether retraction notices penned by journal authorities and authors
   of retracted publications differed in the use of those strategies. A
   content analysis of the retraction notices identified three types of
   retraction stigma construction strategy (i.e., creating marks, assigning
   responsibility, and exposing perils) and four types of retraction stigma
   management strategy (i.e., concealing stigma visibility, refraining from
   labelling, manipulating responsibility assignment, and offering
   correction and remediation). Authorship-based differences were found in
   the deployment of all seven types of stigma construction and management
   strategy and 17 individual strategies. The use of two types of
   construction strategy were significantly associated with the use of
   three types of management strategy. These findings revealed retraction
   notices as capable of both stigmatizing and destigmatizing. Thus,
   retraction notices constitute a discourse genre that is imbued with
   communicative tensions rooted in the diverse functions that they can
   serve.},

Abstract = {Research advances build upon the validity and reproducibility of
   previously published data and findings. Yet irreproducibility in basic
   biologic and preclinical research is pervasive in both academic and
   commercial settings. Lack of reproducibility has led to invalidated
   research breakthroughs, retracted articles, and aborted clinical trials.
   Concerns and requirements for transparent, reproducible, and
   translatable research are accelerated by the rapid growth of
   ``post-publication peer review,{''} open access publishing, and data
   sharing that facilitate the identification of irreproducible
   data/studies; they are magnified by the explosion of high-throughput
   technologies, genomics, and other data-intensive disciplines.
   Collectively, these changes and challenges are decreasing the
   effectiveness of traditional research quality mechanisms and are
   contributing to unacceptable-and unsustainable-levels of
   irreproducibility. The global oncology and basic biologic research
   communities can no longer tolerate or afford widespread irreproducible
   research. This article discusses (i) how irreproducibility in
   preclinical research can ultimately be traced to an absence of a
   unifying life science standards framework, and (ii) makes an urgent case
   for the expanded development and use of consensus-based standards to
   both enhance reproducibility and drive innovations in cancer research.

Abstract = {An article published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet (volume
   351, pages 637-641) led to concerns surrounding the safety of the
   measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, by associating it with an increased
   risk of autism. The paper was later retracted after multiple
   epidemiological studies failed to find any association, but a
   substantial decrease in UK vaccination rates was observed in the years
   following publication. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal
   Bayesian hierarchical model with accompanying software (the R package
   CARBayesST) to simultaneously address three key epidemiological
   questions about vaccination rates: (i) what impact did the controversy
   have on the overall temporal trend in vaccination rates in Scotland;
   (ii) did the magnitude of the spatial inequality in measles
   susceptibility in Scotland increase due to the measles, mumps and
   rubella vaccination scare; and (iii) are there any covariate effects,
   such as deprivation, that impacted on measles susceptibility in
   Scotland. The efficacy of the model is tested by simulation, before
   being applied to measles susceptibility data in Scotland among a series
   of cohorts of children who were aged 2.5-4.5, in September of the years
   1998 to 2014.},

Abstract = {This paper presents newly discovered evidence from the personal
   correspondence of four US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Biological
   Effects of Atomic Radiation (BEAR) Genetics Panelists that their 1956
   report to the public was written by a third party and was neither
   reviewed nor approved by the Panel prior to its publication and release
   to the public. The letters revealed that the 1956 Report contained
   serious errors and did not represent the views of the Panel. The failure
   of the US NAS to notify the public that the Report had not been reviewed
   and approved by the Panel represents a serious breach of ethics. Further
   ethical issues relate to the failure of the NAS to (1) correct the
   errors in the Report within an appropriately timely manner and (2)
   reveal the lack of approval by the Panel even after the Report's
   release. In light of these discoveries and the profound historical-and
   continuing-significance of the 1956 Report to all conventional
   cancer-related risk assessment processes, we opine that this ethical
   improbity must be acknowledged and that this document must be retracted
   by the NAS.},

Title = {Research Misconduct in the Age of Open Science: The Case of STAP Stem
   Cells},
Journal = {SCIENCE AS CULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-23},
Abstract = {In early 2014, Dr Haruko Obokata and her co-authors caused a global
   media storm by publishing two scientific papers in Nature on stem cells.
   The papers proposed a surprisingly simple new method called
   stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) to generate
   pluripotent stem cells for research purposes in a fast and inexpensive
   way. To the dismay of many, both papers were retracted within six months
   of their release due to data fabrication and falsification. The rise and
   fall of the STAP research illustrates the impacts of open science
   practices of quality control and validation on new scientific claims. In
   the STAP case, collective action generated through two online forums-the
   Knoepfler Lab Stem Cell Blog and PubPeer-exposed not only data
   manipulation in the two papers but also the irreproducibility of the
   purported new cellular reprogramming method. The case brings to the fore
   the tentative possibilities as well as potential pitfalls of
   `accelerated virtual witnessing' through crowdsourced post-publication
   peer reviews that value accessibility and inclusiveness. Indeed, it
   calls for empirically grounded discussion on the ongoing reconfiguration
   of the shared system of values and norms or the moral economy of
   science.},

Abstract = {Eric T Poehlman, Ph.D., was an internationally recognized, tenured
   professor at the University of Vermont (UVM) in Burlington when, in
   October 2000, a junior member of Poehlman's laboratory became convinced
   that he had altered data from a study on aging volunteers from the
   Burlington area. This suspicion developed into one of the most
   significant cases of scientific misconduct in the history of the US
   Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Research
   Integrity (ORI), launching a US Department of Justice (DOJ) civil and
   criminal fraud investigation and, eventually, to a much publicized
   guilty plea and felony conviction. In the end, Dr. Poehlman admitted to
   54 findings of scientific misconduct made by the UVM and ORI, agreed to
   retract or correct ten of his publications and to exclude himself from
   federal procurement and nonprocurement transactions for life. The United
   States Government's handling of this case was distinguished by a highly
   cooperative approach that integrated the resources of the US Attorney's
   Office for the District Of Vermont (USAO) and both ORI and the Office of
   the Inspector General (OIG) in HHS in the common goal of prosecuting
   research fraud.},

Abstract = {Humans routinely solve problems of immense computational complexity by
   intuitively forming simple, low-dimensional heuristic strategies(1,2).
   Citizen science (or crowd sourcing) is a way of exploiting this ability
   by presenting scientific research problems to non-experts.
   `Gamification'-the application of game elements in a non-game context-is
   an effective tool with which to enable citizen scientists to provide
   solutions to research problems. The citizen science games Foldit(3),
   EteRNA(4) and EyeWire(5) have been used successfully to study protein
   and RNA folding and neuron mapping, but so far gamification has not been
   applied to problems in quantum physics. Here we report on Quantum Moves,
   an online platform gamifying optimization problems in quantum physics.
   We show that human players are able to find solutions to difficult
   problems associated with the task of quantum computing(6). Players
   succeed where purely numerical optimization fails, and analyses of their
   solutions provide insights into the problem of optimization of a more
   profound and general nature. Using player strategies, we have thus
   developed a few-parameter heuristic optimization method that efficiently
   outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The
   numerical complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases
   for shorter process durations. To understand this better, we produced a
   low-dimensional rendering of the optimization landscape. This rendering
   reveals why traditional optimization methods fail near the quantum speed
   limit (that is, the shortest process duration with perfect
   fidelity)(7-9). Combined analyses of optimization landscapes and
   heuristic solution strategies may benefit wider classes of optimization
   problems in quantum physics and beyond.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The autoimmune/autoinflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) was
   first described in 2011. The aluminium containing adjuvants of vaccines
   were stated to be one of the main causes of the condition. Other
   disorders associated with ASIA include siliconosis, Gulf war syndrome,
   sick building syndrome and the macrophagic myositis syndrome. We have
   recently reviewed ASIA as defined by its authors. We have shown that the
   definition of ASIA is imprecise and includes all patients with an
   autoimmune disorder as well as potentially the entire population.
   Application of the Bradford Hill criteria for causality does not support
   ASIA as an outcome of exposure to aluminium containing adjuvants in
   vaccines. The advocates of ASIA highlight animal models as evidence for
   the existence of the disorder. However, as this review will demonstrate,
   animal models purporting to support the existence of ASIA have
   methodological, analytical and ethical flaws which, in our view, refute
   the existence of the condition. Three publications by the advocates of
   ASIA were recently retracted from peer-reviewed journals. We call for an
   immediate moratorium on animal experiments of ASIA until an independent
   inquiry has been conducted to determine the existence of a clinically
   relevant syndrome, identifiable as ASIA in humans. (C) 2018 Published by

Abstract = {Retraction: `At diabetes-like concentration, glucose down-regulates the
   placental serotonin transport system in a cell-cycle-dependent manner,'
   by Unal R., Ahmed B.A., Jeffus B.C., Harney J.T., Lyle C.S., Wu Y.-K.,
   Chambers T.C., Reece E.A. and Kilic F., Journal of Neurochemistry 101(4)
   937-948, 2007 (). The above article, published online on 23rd January
   2007 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been
   retracted by agreement between the Journal's Editor in Chief, Jorg B.
   Schulz, and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. The article has been retracted
   because of inconsistencies with the presentation of some critical data
   and the inability of the author to provide the original data or to
   otherwise provide corrections for publication in a corrigendum. A
   detailed explanation is provided below. The corresponding author, Dr.
   Fusun Kilic, notified the Journal's Editorial Office of the following
   concerns related to the article that were brought to his attention:
   Figures 2C and 2D are duplicates The `Lysate' and the `Bound' lanes in
   Figure 7A are identical The Myc-SERT bands in Figure 7B, lanes 2 and 3
   are duplicates of lanes 4 and 5, and again of lanes 6 and 7 The 45 kD
   bands in Figure 7B, lanes 1, 2, and 3 are duplicates of lanes 5, 6, and
   7
   Dr. Kilic investigated the concerns and, in response to the journal,
   concluded that they were unjustified. Dr. Kilic disagreed that the
   Western bands in question were identical, pointing at mere similarities
   that resemble identity. Overlay of the lanes was impaired by poor image
   quality and unavailability of the original raw files. The Journal's
   Editorial Office undertook its own visual inspection and, in relation to
   Figure 7B, maintains that duplication is present. They concluded: In
   Figure 7B, 45 kD, lanes 1 and 5 appear identical, as well as lane 2 and
   6, and lanes 3, 4, and 7 (with lane 4 being clipped at the right-hand
   side) In the Flag-SERT, lanes 2 and 6 appear identical, as well as lanes
   3 and 7 In the Myc-SERT, lanes 2 and 6 appear identical, as well as
   lanes 3, 5, and 7. The problems are highlighted in the following

Abstract = {Over the years, cases of retractions due to unintentional errors or
   research misconduct have been the subject of discussion, being
   indispensable to avoid the propagation of misleading information. To
   understand this matter in the Brazilian scenario, this study
   characterizes the retractions of authorship or co-authorship of
   Brazilian researchers between 2002 and 2019, their related consequences
   and impacts on scientific activity. With a data collection performed at
   the Retraction Watch database, we analyzed quantitative aspects of the
   reasons for retractions, stratification by areas of knowledge, the time
   between publication and retraction, the association of journals and
   impact factor, authors'recidivism, the institutional collaboration
   between Brazilian institutions and countries and funding sources. The
   results of the analysis of 162 retractions indicate the prevalence of
   plagiarism (12.2\%), the incidence of retracted articles in the
   Bioscience area (28.1\%), in journals with Impact Factors between 2 and
   5 (38.0\%), and with 2 to 4 authors (38.8\%). The occurrences and
   recurrences of retractions due to misconduct have an impact not only the
   author's professional activity but science. Thus, this article
   emphasizes the importance of prompt retraction, as well as of the need
   to improve mechanisms to prevent these articles from being published
   from the start.},

Title = {Why and how do journals retract articles? An analysis of Medline
   retractions 1988-2008},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {9},
Pages = {567-570},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background Journal editors are responsible for what they publish and
   therefore have a duty to correct the record if published work is found
   to be unreliable. One method for such correction is retraction of an
   article. Anecdotal evidence suggested a lack of consistency in journal
   policies and practices regarding retraction. In order to develop
   guidelines, we reviewed retractions in Medline to discover how and why
   articles were retracted.
   Methods We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008
   and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This
   yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction
   including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators.
   Results Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and
   currently represent 0.02\% of included articles. Retractions were issued
   by authors (63\%), editors (21\%), journals (6\%), publishers (2\%) and
   institutions (1\%). Reasons for retraction included honest error or
   non-replicable findings (40\%), research misconduct (28\%), redundant
   publication (17\%) and unstated/ unclear (5\%). Some of the stated
   reasons might have been addressed by corrections.
   Conclusions Journals' retraction practices are not uniform. Some
   retractions fail to state the reason, and therefore fail to distinguish
   error from misconduct. We have used our findings to inform guidelines on
   retractions.},

Title = {Better guidance is needed for editorial expressions of concern},
Journal = {ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH-ETHICS INTEGRITY AND POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 30},
Abstract = {On occasion, following the publication of a paper, serious concerns
   might be raised, either about the study, the author(s), or background
   processes. When editors-in-chief (EiCs) have sufficient evidence in the
   case of a serious ethical offense or methodological errors that may
   invalidate the paper's findings or ethical standing, they can retract
   the paper rapidly. However, in the interim period between receiving a
   report and seeking a solution, several weeks, months or even years might
   pass, and readers need to be alerted to its potential unreliability. In
   such an instance, the current alternative (but not corrective) document
   takes the form of an editorial expression of concern (EoC). However, a
   case might be unresolved for a long time, with an EoC attached to it, so
   EiCs are encouraged to seek a resolution as promptly as possible because
   there are academics who might need to cite and/or rely on that paper.
   Curiously, even though a comprehensive debate is provided by COPE ethics
   guidelines and ICMJE recommendations, which refer to EoCs, guidance is
   not entirely clear. This paper makes an attempt to improve guidelines
   that editors could consider when faced with the dilemma of whether to
   issue an EoC, or not.},

Title = {Ethical failings: The problematic history of cancer risk assessment},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper demonstrates that unethical conduct by the US National
   Academy of Sciences (NAS) Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation (BEAR)
   I Genetics Panel led to their recommendation of the Linear Non-Threshold
   (LNT) Model for radiation risk assessment and its subsequent adoption by
   the US and the world community. The analysis, which is based largely on
   preserved communications of the US NAS Genetics Panel members, reveals
   that Panel members and their administrative leadership at the NAS
   displayed an integrated series of unethical actions designed to ensure,
   (1) the acceptance of the LNT and (2) funding to radiation geneticist
   panel members and professional colleagues. These findings are
   significant because major public policies in open democracies, such as
   cancer risk assessment and other issues impacted by public fears of
   radiation or chemical exposures, require ethical foundations.
   Recognition of these ethical failures of the BEAR I Genetics Panel
   should require a high level administrative, legislative and scientific
   reassessment of the scientific foundations of cancer risk assessment,
   with the likely result necessitating revision of current policies and
   practices. The BEAR I Genetics Panel, 1956 Science journal publication
   should immediately be retracted because it contains deliberate
   misrepresentations of the scientific record that were designed to
   manipulate scientific and public opinion on radiation risk assessment in
   a dishonest manner.},

Abstract = {Previous research has found authors of retracted publications
   responsible for the vast majority of retractions. Although considerable
   research attention has been given to reasons for retraction, few studies
   have examined author-related reasons from a cross-disciplinary and a
   severity-based perspective. Drawing on data from the Web of Science Core
   Collection, this study examined 6,861 retraction notices published
   before 2020, in which authors were identified as the sole entities
   responsible for retraction. A close scrutiny identified 17 distinct
   reasons for retraction, with the three most frequent (i.e.,
   plagiarism/self-plagiarism, unreliable data/findings, and data
   fabrication/falsification) accounting for 78.87\% of the retraction
   notices. Based on the severity of the culpable actions involved, the 17
   reasons were grouped into five categories: blatant misconduct (disclosed
   in 61.08\% of the retraction notices), inappropriate conduct (18.18\%),
   questionable conduct (0.95\%), honest error (4.62\%), and
   uncategorizable conduct (30.52\%). Retraction notices in hard
   disciplines (i.e., natural sciences) were found more likely than those
   in soft disciplines (i.e., social sciences, arts, and the humanities) to
   disclose authorship issues, unreliable data/findings, uncategorizable
   conduct, and inappropriate conduct. Retraction notices in soft
   disciplines were more likely than those in hard disciplines to disclose
   unspecified misconduct and blatant misconduct.},

   Lamba(1) The above article from the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and
   Therapeutics, published online on 21 November 2017 in Wiley Online
   Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted following
   discussions with the authors, the Journal Editors and John Wiley \& Sons
   Ltd. The Retraction has been agreed as this paper was submitted under
   the joint names of Yan Wang, Jatinder K. Lamba and a third co-author.
   After acceptance of the paper, Dr Wang wrote to the EiC asking for the
   name of the third co-author to be dropped because of insufficient
   contribution. The EiC asked that the request be signed by all three
   authors. When this arrived, the paper was published online with only Dr
   Wang and Dr Lamba. However, Dr Lamba wrote to the EiC after publication
   indicating that she had not previously seen the manuscript and that
   there were co-authors missing. As it is clear that Dr Lamba's signature
   was forged, we cannot rely on the integrity of the report. The
   retraction is with the agreement of Dr Lamba but not of Dr Wang.

   because the retraction of published research is associated with
   undesirable behavior and consequently carries negative consequences for
   the individuals involved. The ambiguity of authorship, however, has
   serious ethical ramifications and creates methodological problems for
   research on RNs that requires clear authorship attribution. This article
   reports a study conducted to identify RN textual features that can be
   used to disambiguate obscured authorship, ascertain the extent of
   authorship evasion in RNs from two disciplinary clusters, and determine
   if the disciplines varied in the distributions of different types of RN
   authorship. Drawing on a corpus of 370 RNs archived in the Web of
   Science for the hard discipline of Cell Biology and the soft disciplines
   of Business, Finance, and Management, this study has identified 25 types
   of textual markers that can be used to disambiguate authorship, and
   revealed that only 25.68\% of the RNs could be unambiguously attributed
   to authors of the retracted articles alone or jointly and that
   authorship could not be determined for 28.92\% of the RNs. Furthermore,
   the study has found marked disciplinary differences in the different
   categories of RN authorship. These results point to the need for more
   explicit editorial requirements about RN authorship and their strict
   enforcement.},

Abstract = {Background: Pre-prints have become an increasing part of the biomedical
   landscape. For example, during the first month of operation, July 2019,
   medRxiv received 176 submissions, one year later, in June 2020,
   including the first few months of COVID-19, it received 1866
   submissions. The current relevant question is how to ensure an accurate
   scientific record given that there may be important differences between
   a pre-print and the peer-reviewed publication.Methods: Based upon the
   experience of the authors, conversations with editors, and a focused
   selective review of the literature, including the recommendations of
   some professional groups, a limited number of practical recommendations
   were formulated. Results: Peer-reviewed journals should request that
   authors indicate if the submitted manuscript has been posted on a
   pre-print server; ensure this is noted in the article if it is published
   by including the digital object identifier (DOI); and detail any major
   differences in the conclusions between the pre-print and the article.
   Pre-print servers should ensure that all content is marked as not
   peer-reviewed and be prepared to retract any pre-print that is
   fundamentally flawed within days that could influence clinical or public
   health recommendations that have therapeutic implications.Conclusions:
   Authors, those responsible for pre-print servers, and editors of
   peer-reviewed journals are responsible for ensuring an accurate
   scientific record.},

Abstract = {The buried penis is a Fare congenital entity, whose treatment is
   surgical. There are few publications concerning this matter. The authors
   report on their experience in 10 cases (1990-1995).
   In this abnormality the tip of the glans does not project from the pubic
   or scrotal skin. It is due to: 1) an excessive development of the penile
   fascia which retracts the penis; 2) insufficient attachment of the
   penile skin at the base of the penis; 3) often excessive prepubic fat
   worsens the appearance of the abnormality but does not by itself totally
   explain it; 4) a tight phimosis is often present.
   Surgical treatment is necessary because this aspect tends to persist
   even after puberty. One cannot indeed count on the development at the
   age of puberty, neither on the diminution of the fat, nor on the simple
   cure of the phimosis. One must above all ban circumcision which causes
   the risk of eliminating the skin necessary for reconstruction. The
   surgical procedure will comprise: 1) a longitudinal dorsal incision
   extended circumferentially; 2) resection of the thickened fascia penis;
   3) anchoring of the deep face of the dermis to the proximal part of the
   fascia penis at the base of the penis.
   This surgical procedure has always brought a significant improvement to
   the appearance of the penis.},

   elbow dislocation: A case report},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Introduction and importance: The treatment preference for neglected
   elbow dislocation is by open reduction and lengthening the tricep
   muscle. If the dislocation is not reduced for more than 6 months,
   degenerative resorption would have occurred. We did total elbow
   arthroplasty (TEA) with a tricep turn-down flap for the management in
   this case. The use of a tricep flap for tricep shortening after
   unreduced elbow dislocation has been reported in previous publications
   but none used a turn-down flap.Case presentation: An 82-year-old woman
   came to the orthopedic outpatient clinic with pain and discomfort on her
   right elbow. The arm affected by the injury was her dominant hand,
   restricting her from farming and leisure activities. Exploration
   findings confirmed the presence of a dislocated elbow with associated
   soft tissue complications. The cartilage was degeneratively destructed,
   and the tricep muscle was retracted.Clinical discussion: In our case,
   tricep shortening was managed with elongation using a turn-down flap.
   The lack of soft tissue layers and thin fibrous fascias results in
   tension-vulnerable TEA surgical wounds. This is caused by the
   insufficient coverage of the joint, which leads to wound complications.
   Previous studies of turn-down flap procedures showed good flap survival
   and functional outcomes.Conclusion: Tricep turn-down flap could be an
   option for tricep lengthening procedures in unreduced neglected elbow
   joint dislocation.},

Abstract = {The detection of plagiarism in scholarly articles is a complex process.
   It requires not just quantitative analysis with the similarity recording
   by anti-plagiarism software but also assessment of the readers' opinion,
   pointing to the theft of ideas, methodologies, and graphics. In this
   article we describe a blatant case of plagiarism by Chinese authors, who
   copied a Russian article from a non-indexed and not widely visible
   Russian journal, and published their own report in English in an
   open-access journal indexed by Scopus and Web of Science and archived in
   PubMed Central. The details of copying in the translated English article
   were presented by the Russian author to the chief editor of the index
   journal, consultants from Scopus, anti-plagiarism experts, and the
   administrator of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). The
   correspondents from Scopus and COPE pointed to the decisive role of the
   editors' of the English journal who may consider further actions if
   plagiarism is confirmed. After all, the chief editor of the English
   journal retracted the article on grounds of plagiarism and published a
   retraction note, although no details of the complexity of the case were
   reported. The case points to the need for combining anti-plagiarism
   efforts and actively seeking opinion of non-native English-speaking
   authors and readers who may spot intellectual theft which is not always
   detected by software.},

   Garner told me that using a new search engine methodology (eTBLAST) he
   and colleagues had identified a paper in the International Journal of

   similarity to an earlier paper published in 1992 in the New England

Abstract = {The genus Morchella has gone through turbulent taxonomic treatments.
   Although significant progress in Morchella systematics has been achieved
   in the past decade, several problems remain unresolved and taxonomy in
   the genus is still in flux. In late 2019, a paper published in the
   open-access journal Scientific Reports raised serious concerns about the
   taxonomic stability of the genus, but also about the future of academic
   publishing. The paper, entitled ``High diversity of Morchella and a
   novel lineage of the esculenta clade from the north Qinling Mountains
   revealed by GCPSR-based study{''} by Phanpadith and colleagues, suffered
   from gross methodological errors, included false results and artifactual
   phylogenies, had misapplied citations throughout, and proposed a new
   species name invalidly. Although the paper was eventually retracted by
   Scientific Reports in 2021, the fact that such an overtly flawed and
   scientifically unsound paper was published in a high-ranked Q1 journal
   raises alarming questions about quality controls and safekeeping
   procedures in scholarly publishing. Using this paper as a case study, we
   provide a critical review on the pitfalls of Morchella systematics
   followed by a series of recommendations for the delimitation of species,
   description of taxa, and ultimately for a sustainable taxonomy in
   Morchella. Problems and loopholes in the academic publishing system are
   also identified and discussed, and additional quality controls in the
   pre- and post-publication stages are proposed.},

   to which the reiteration of declarations, the confrontation with the

   circumstances can certainly contribute, that causes her a sense of
   frustration and helplessness. which must necessarily be remedied as much

   The judicial assessment of the declaration of the victim of gender
   violence presents important peculiarities derived from the commissive
   dynamics in an ordinary sphere of intimacy, from the behavior of the
   victim who does not declare, withdraws the complaint, retracts ... They
   are the devastating consequences of a violence that seeks the domination
   of the victim, her personal annulment, and with primary character in the
   consideration that the victim of gender violence is passive subject of
   the crime, not merely an external witness to the fact. The victim not
   only ``has seen a fact{''} but ``has suffered it{''}.},

Title = {Scientific fraud in 20 falsified anesthesia papers. Detection using
   financial auditing methods},
Journal = {ANAESTHESIST},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {61},
Number = {6},
Pages = {543-549},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Data from natural sources show counter-intuitive distribution patterns
   for the leading digits to the left of the decimal point and the digit 1
   is observed more frequently than all other numbers. This pattern, which
   was first described by Newcomb and later confirmed by Benford, is used
   in financial and tax auditing to detect fraud. Deviations from the
   pattern indicate possible falsifications. Anesthesiology journals are
   affected not only by ghostwriting and plagiarism but also by
   counterfeiting. In the present study 20 publications in anesthesiology
   known to be falsified by an author were investigated for irregularities
   with respect to Benford's law using the chi(2)-test and the Z-test. In
   the 20 retracted publications an average first-digit frequency of 243.1
   (standard deviation SD +/- 118.2, range: 30-592) and an average
   second-digit frequency of 132.3 (SD +/- 72.2, range: 15-383) were found.
   The observed distribution of the first and second digits to the left of
   the decimal point differed significantly (p < 0.01) from the expected
   distribution described by Benford. Only the observed absolute
   frequencies for digits 3, 4 and 5 did not differ significantly from the
   expected values. In an analysis of each paper 17 out of 20 studies
   differed significantly from the expected value for the first digit and
   18 out of 20 studies varied significantly from the expected value of the
   second digit. Only one paper did not vary significantly from expected
   values for the digits to the left of the decimal. For comparison, a
   meta-analysis using complex mathematical procedures was chosen as a
   control. The analysis showed a first-digit distribution consistent with
   the Benford distribution. Thus, the method used in the present study
   seems to be sensitive for detecting fraud. Additional statements of
   specificity cannot yet be made as this requires further analysis of data
   that is definitely not falsified. Future studies exploring conformity
   might help prevent falsified studies from being published.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {In 2005 experimental work was published about the successful surgical
   management of fractures of the condylar head through a retroauricular
   approach. There were two reports in German, and later publications have
   not mentioned this route to open reduction and internal fixation of such
   fractures. The approach was studied in Germany but was poorly described
   and illustrated; later reports in English do not mention this route to
   the mandible. The aim of this study was to illustrate the retroauricular
   transmeatal approach, and briefly to review current surgical approaches
   to the mandibular skeleton and their technical variants. We exposed the
   mandibular skeleton by a retroauricular transmeatal route with
   transection of the external ear, dissection of the parotid gland,
   isolation of the retromandibular vein, and protection of the frontal
   branch of the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve within the
   substance of the anteriorly retracted flap. Although we cannot draw any
   significant conclusions, the retroauricular transmeatal approach ensures
   extremely low risk of injury to the facial nerve, and leaves an
   invisible scar. The morbidity is low in terms of facial nerve lesions,
   vascular injuries, aesthetic deformity, auditory stenosis, salivary
   fistulas, sialocele and Frey syndrome. We think that further prospective
   clinical trials are needed better to assess and eventually develop this
   approach. (C) 2011 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial

Title = {Downstream retraction of preprinted research in the life and medical
   sciences},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Retractions have been on the rise in the life and clinical sciences in
   the last decade, likely due to both broader accessibility of published
   scientific research and increased vigilance on the part of publishers.
   In this same period, there has been a greater than ten-fold increase in
   the posting of preprints by researchers in these fields. While this
   development has significantly accelerated the rate of research
   dissemination and has benefited early-career researchers eager to show
   productivity, it has also introduced challenges with respect to
   provenance tracking, version linking, and, ultimately, back-propagation
   of events such as corrigenda, expressions of concern, and retractions
   that occur on the journal-published version. The aim of this study was
   to understand the extent of this problem among preprint servers that
   routinely link their preprints to the corollary versions published in
   journals. To present a snapshot of the current state of downstream
   retractions of articles preprinted in three large preprint servers
   (Research Square, bioRxiv, and medRxiv), the DOIs of the
   journal-published versions linked to preprints were matched to entries
   in the Retraction Watch database. A total of 30 retractions were
   identified, representing only 0.01\% of all content posted on these
   servers. Of these, 11 retractions were clearly noted by the preprint
   servers; however, the existence of a preprint was only acknowledged by
   the retracting journal in one case. The time from publication to
   retraction averaged 278 days, notably lower than the average for
   articles overall (839 days). In 70\% of cases, retractions downstream of
   preprints were due-at least in part-to ethical or procedural misconduct.
   In 63\% of cases, the nature of the retraction suggested that the
   conclusions were no longer reliable. Over time, the lack of propagation
   of critical information across the publication life cycle will pose a
   threat to the scholarly record and to scientific integrity. It is
   incumbent on preprint servers, publishers, and the systems that connect
   them to address these issues before their scale becomes untenable.},

Title = {Passive Contribution of ChatGPT to Scientific Papers},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 7},
Abstract = {Arguably ChatGPT jeopardizes the integrity and validity of the academic
   publications instead of ethically facilitating them. ChatGPT can
   apparently fulfill a portion of one of the four authorship criteria set
   by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), i.e.,
   ``drafting.{''} However, the authorship criteria by ICMJE must all be
   collectively met, not singly or partially. Many published manuscripts or
   preprints have credited ChatGPT by including it in the author byline,
   and the academic publishing enterprise seems to be unguided on how to
   handle such manuscripts. Interestingly, PLoS Digital Health removed
   ChatGPT off a paper which had ChatGPT listed initially in the author
   byline of the preprint version. Revised publishing policies are, thus,
   promptly required to guide a consistent stance regarding ChatGPT or
   similar artificial content generators. Publishing policies must accord
   among publishers, preprint servers
   (https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers), universities, and research
   institutions worldwide and across different disciplines. Ideally,
   considering any declaration of the contribution of ChatGPT to writing
   any scientific article should be recognized as publishing misconduct
   immediately and be retracted. Meanwhile, all parties involved in the
   scientific reporting and publishing must be educated about how ChatGPT
   fails to meet the essential authorship criteria, so that no author must
   submit a manuscript with ChatGPT contributing as a ``co-author.{''}
   Meanwhile, using ChatGPT for writing laboratory reports or short
   summaries of experiments may be acceptable, but not for academic
   publishing or formal scientific reporting.},

Abstract = {Conflicts of interest (COIs) do occur in healthcare research, yet their
   impact on research in the field of infection prevention and control
   (IPC) is unknown. We conducted a narrative review aiming to identify
   examples of COIs in IPC research. In addition to well-known instances,
   we conducted PubMed and Google searches to identify and report case
   studies of COIs in IPC and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which were
   chosen arbitrarily following consensus meetings, to illustrate different
   types of COIs. We also searched the RetractionWatch database and blog to
   systematically identify retracted IPC and/or infectious disease-related
   papers. Our review highlights COIs in academic research linked to ties
   between industry and physicians, journal editors, peer-reviewed
   journals' choice for publication, and guideline committees participants
   and authors. It explores how COIs can affect research and could be
   managed. We also present several selected case studies that involve (1)
   the chlorhexidine industry and how it has used marketing trials and key
   opinion leaders to promote off-label use of its products; (2) the copper
   industry and how reporting of its trials in IPC have furthered their
   agenda; (3) the influence of a company developing closed infusion
   systems for catheters and how this affects networks in low- and
   middle-income countries and guideline development; (4) potential
   perverse incentives hospitals may have in reporting
   healthcare-associated infection or AMR rates and how government
   intervention may restrict AMR research for fear of bad publicity and
   subsequent negative economic consequences. Finally, the analysis of
   reasons for the retraction of previously published papers highlights the
   fact that misconduct in research may have other motivations than
   financial gain, the most visible form of COIs. COIs occur in the field
   of research in general, and IPC and AMR are no exceptions. Their effects
   pervade all aspects of the research and publication processes. We
   believe that, in addition to improvements in management strategies of
   COIs, increased public funding should be available to decrease
   researchers' dependency on industry ties. Further research is needed on
   COIs and their management.},

Abstract = {The quality and authenticity of images is essential for data
   presentation, especially in the life sciences. Questionable images may
   often be a first indicator for questionable results, too. Therefore, a
   tool that uses mathematical methods to detect suspicious images in large
   image archives can be a helpful instrument to improve quality assurance
   in publications. As a first step towards a systematic screening tool,
   especially for journal editors and other staff members who are
   responsible for quality assurance, such as laboratory supervisors, we
   propose a basic classification of image manipulation. Based on this
   classification, we developed and explored some simple algorithms to
   detect copied areas in images. Using an artificial image and two
   examples of previously published modified images, we apply quantitative
   methods such as pixel-wise comparison, a nearest neighbor and a variance
   algorithm to detect copied-and-pasted areas or duplicated images. We
   show that our algorithms are able to detect some simple types of image
   alteration, such as copying and pasting background areas. The variance
   algorithm detects not only identical, but also very similar areas that
   differ only by brightness. Further types could, in principle, be
   implemented in a standardized scanning routine. We detected the copied
   areas in a proven case of image manipulation in Germany and showed the
   similarity of two images in a retracted paper from the Kato labs, which
   has been widely discussed on sites such as pubpeer and retraction watch.},

Title = {How do Chinese universities address research integrity and misconduct? A
   review of university documents},

Abstract = {Background Scientific researchers are expected to follow the
   professional norms in their own domain. With a growing number of
   scientific publications retracted and research misconduct cases revealed
   in recent years, Chinese biomedical research integrity is questioned. As
   institutions educating and training future researchers, universities and
   the guidance they provide are important for the research quality and
   integrity of the country. Therefore, through a review of the guidance
   and policy documents on research integrity in Chinese universities, this
   work aims to investigate how the professional norms are specified in
   these documents. Methods After a stratified sampling, 53 universities
   were selected. Their guidance and policy documents on research integrity
   were collected via a web search of their official websites. The search
   was confirmed by these universities. Then the content of all the
   collected documents were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
   Results 118 active university documents were collected and analyzed.
   Most of the Chinese universities we investigated had their own guidance
   or policy on research integrity. They listed principles or examples of
   desired and undesired academic practices, investigation procedures and
   punishments of academic misconduct, and put forward measures to promote
   research integrity. Differences on specific practices and principles
   were observed between university groups and with European university
   documents. Conclusion Despite the discrepancy they have, all these
   documents were designed to promote research integrity and cultivate a
   good research environment in Chinese biomedical domain. Nevertheless,
   there is still room for improvement, for example, through more
   consultation of international guidance.},

Title = {Topical use of MMC in the upper aerodigestive tract: a review on the

Abstract = {Not much is known about the side effects of mitomycin C (MMC), an
   anti-fibrogenetic agent, in the upper aerodigestive tract. However, its
   use in ophthalmology is widely known and without quantitatively
   important side effects. A literature review was performed for side
   effects of MMC in the upper aerodigestive tract. Forty-six articles,
   describing the use of MMC to prevent scarring, were retracted from
   PubMed. Thirty-two are human studies. MMC is used in different
   concentrations (0.1-10 mg/ml) with different application times (2-5 min)
   and frequencies (up to 4 times). Five hundred and thirty-eight patients
   were included in those publications, of whom 19 developed side effects
   (3.53\%). No side effects developed in studies, where post-application
   irrigation with saline was reported. The longest mean follow-up period
   is 75.5 months. Direct relations between the reported side effects and
   MMC seem absent in most studies. Serious complications seem to occur
   when MMC is used in high concentrations. Unfortunately, sometimes
   crucial information is lacking. One patient was described who supposedly
   developed laryngeal carcinoma after repeated treatment of hyperkeratosis
   and anterior commissure webbing. Animal studies show that excessive
   fibrin production can lead to acute airway obstruction. In conclusion,
   topical application of MMC on a wound with consecutive irrigation with
   saline can be performed safely to prevent scar formation in circular
   structures of the upper aerodigestive tract. Long-term yearly control of
   the application site seems advisable.},

Journal = {JAMIA OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Month = {JAN 7},
Abstract = {Lay Summary The COVID-19 pandemic has seen several articles published in
   high-profile journals being retracted. These retractions undermined even
   more confidence in the peer-review process, which is not considered
   sufficiently reliable to generate trust in the published results. A
   significant number of these retractions occurred after in-depth scrutiny
   of the methodology and results by the scientific community. This partly
   stems from opacity in published results, the practical implementation of
   the statistical analysis often remaining undisclosed. This article
   presents a simple workflow that leverages a combination of preexisting
   and newly developed biomedical informatics tools to promote transparent
   statistical analysis in biomedical research, which relies on the
   National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) BioData Catalyst
   platform. By streamlining access to data and analysis source code, it
   eases results reproduction and accelerates supplemental analyses. Such
   workflows will be encouraged for future publications from NHLBI-funded
   studies. We illustrate it by reproducing the results of the ORCHID
   clinical trial, which evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in
   COVID-19 patients.
   Reproducibility in medical research has been a long-standing issue. More
   recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has publicly underlined this fact as the
   retraction of several studies reached out to general media audiences. A
   significant number of these retractions occurred after in-depth scrutiny
   of the methodology and results by the scientific community.
   Consequently, these retractions have undermined confidence in the
   peer-review process, which is not considered sufficiently reliable to
   generate trust in the published results. This partly stems from opacity
   in published results, the practical implementation of the statistical
   analysis often remaining undisclosed. We present a workflow that uses a
   combination of informatics tools to foster statistical reproducibility:
   an open-source programming language, Jupyter Notebook, cloud-based data
   repository, and an application programming interface can streamline an
   analysis and help to kick-start new analyses. We illustrate this
   principle by (1) reproducing the results of the ORCHID clinical trial,
   which evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients,
   and (2) expanding on the analyses conducted in the original trial by
   investigating the association of premedication with biological
   laboratory results. Such workflows will be encouraged for future
   publications from National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded
   studies.},

Abstract = {Background: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an acquired
   defect of the cellular immunity associated with the infection by the
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The disease has reached pandemic
   proportion and has been considered a public health concern. This study
   is aimed at analyzing the trend of HIV/AIDS research in Nigeria. Method:
   We used the PUBMED database to a conduct bibliometric analysis of
   HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria from 1986 to 2021 employing ``HIV
   ``, ``AIDS ``, ``acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ``, ``Human
   immunodeficiency virus ``, and ``Nigeria `` as search description. The
   most common bibliometric indicators were applied for the selected
   publications. Result: The number of scientific research articles
   retrieved for HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria was 2796. Original
   research was the predominant article type. Articles authored by 4
   authors consisted majority of the papers. The University of Ibadan was
   found to be the most productive institution. Institutions in the United
   States dominated external production with the University of Maryland at
   the top. The most utilized journal was PLoS ONE. While Iliyasu Z. was
   the most productive principal author, Crowel TA. was the overall most
   productive author with the highest collaborative strength. The keyword
   analysis using overlay visualization showed a gradual shift from disease
   characteristics to diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Trend in
   HIV/AIDS research in Nigeria is increasing yet evolving. Four articles
   were retracted while two had an expression of concern. Conclusion: The
   growth of scientific literature in HIV/AIDS-related research in Nigeria
   was found to be high and increasing. However, the hotspot analysis still
   shows more unexplored grey areas in future.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose-Significant bone mineral density (BMD) reduction
   occurs in stroke patients on the hemiplegic side compared with the
   intact side, To elucidate the pathogenesis of hip fractures in this
   population, we measured serum markers of bone metabolism and BMD in the
   stroke patients within 1 year (early group) and between 1 and 2 years
   after onset of hemiplegia (long-term group).
   Methods-Sera were collected from 51 patients from the early group and 93
   patients from the long-term group. All patients had hemiplegia. Sera
   were assayed for pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide
   of type I collagen (ICTP; a bone resorption marker) and bone Gla protein
   (a bone formation marker). The z score of BMD was determined in both
   second metacarpals.
   Results-Serum ICTP concentrations (ng/mL) were higher in the early group
   (15.4+/-4.1) than in the long-term group (6.7+/-4.4). Bone Gla protein
   was normal or low in both groups. Multiple regression analysis
   identified Barthel Index, degree of hemiplegia, and illness duration as
   independent determinants of ICTP in the early group, whereas Barthel
   Index, degree of hemiplegia, and serum calcium were determinants of ICTP
   in the long-term group. There were statistically significant
   correlations between the z score of the hemiplegic side and age, Barthel
   Index, degree of hemiplegia, illness duration, 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   (25-OHD), and ICTP in the early group and between the z score and degree
   of hemiplegia and 25-OHD level in the long-term group.
   Conclusions-The pathogenesis of reduced BMD differed between the early
   and long-term stroke groups. These results suggest that in the early
   group, increased bone resorption caused by immobilization was
   responsible for osteopenia on the hemiplegic side, whereas the degree of
   hemiplegia and 25-OHD level were the determinants of osteopenia in the
   long-term group.},

Title = {Blood pressure reduction and clinical outcomes with
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
   blockers: protocol for a systematic review and meta-regression analysis},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Background: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and
   angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) efficaciously reduce systolic
   blood pressure (BP), a well-established risk factor for myocardial
   infarction (MI). Both inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, albeit
   through different mechanisms, and produce similar reductions in BP.
   However, in parallel meta-analyses of ACEi and ARB trials, ACEis reduce
   risk of MI whereas ARBs do not-a phenomenon described as the `ARB-MI
   paradox'. In addition, ACEis reduce all-cause mortality, whereas ARBs do
   not, which appears to be independent of BP lowering. The divergent
   cardiovascular effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, despite similar BP
   reductions, are counter-intuitive. This systematic review aims to
   ascertain the extent to which clinical outcomes in randomised trials of
   ACEi and ARBs are attributable to reductions in systolic BP.
   Methods: A comprehensive search of bibliographic databases will be
   performed to identify all randomised studies of agents of the ACEi and
   ARB class. Placebo and active comparator-controlled studies that report
   clinical outcomes, with greater than 500 person-years of follow-up in
   each study arm, will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen
   study records against a priori-defined eligibility criteria and perform
   data extraction. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be applied to all
   included studies. Studies retracted subsequent to initial publication
   will be excluded. Primary outcomes of interest include MI and all-cause
   mortality; secondary outcomes include stroke, heart failure,
   revascularisation and cardiovascular mortality. Meta-regression will be
   performed, evaluating the relationship between attained reduction in
   systolic BP and relative risk of each outcome, stratified by drug class.
   Where a BP-dependent effect exists (two-tailed p value < 0.05), relative
   risks, standardised per 10 mmHg difference in BP, will be reported for
   each study outcome. Publication bias will be examined using Funnel
   plots, and calculation of Egger's statistic.
   Discussion: This systematic review will provide a detailed synthesis of
   evidence regarding the relationship between BP reduction and clinical
   outcomes with ACEi and ARBs. Greater understanding of the dependency of
   the effect of each class on BP reduction will advance insight into the
   nature of the ARB-MI paradox and guide the future usage of these agents.},

Abstract = {A recent publication by Seng et al. in this journal reports the
   crystallographic structure of refolded, full-length SMN protein and two
   disease-relevant derivatives thereof. Here, we would like to suggest
   that at least two of the structures reported in that study are
   incorrect. We present evidence that one of the associated
   crystallographic datasets is derived from a crystal of the bacterial
   Sm-like protein Hfq and that a second dataset is derived from a crystal
   of the bacterial Gab protein. Both proteins are frequent contaminants of
   bacterially overexpressed proteins which might have been co-purified
   during metal affinity chromatography. A third structure presented in the
   Seng et al. paper cannot be examined further because neither the atomic
   coordinates, nor the diffraction intensities were made publicly
   available. The Tudor domain protein SMN has been shown to be a component
   of the SMN complex, which mediates the assembly of RNA-protein complexes
   of uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs). Importantly,
   this activity is reduced in SMA patients, raising the possibility that
   the aetiology of SMA is linked to RNA metabolism. Structural studies on
   diverse components of the SMN complex, including fragments of SMN itself
   have contributed greatly to our understanding of the cellular UsnRNP
   assembly machinery. Yet full-length SMN has so far evaded structural
   elucidation. The Seng et al. study claimed to have closed this gap, but
   based on the results presented here, the only conclusion that can be
   drawn is that the Seng et al. study is largely invalid and should be
   retracted from the literature.},

Title = {Correlation Between Altmetric Attention Scores and Citations for
   Articles Published in High-Impact Factor Ophthalmology Journals From
   2018 to 2019},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE The Altmetric attention score (AAS) provides new information
   to gauge the impact of a research article not found through typical
   metrics, such as impact factor or citation counts.
   OBJECTIVE To explore the association between AAS and common impact
   markers among high-impact ophthalmology journals from 2018 to 2019.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS All articles published in the American
   Journal of Ophthalmology (AJO), JAMA Ophthalmology (JAMAO), and
   Ophthalmology (OPH) from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, were
   collected for this cross-sectional study. Excluded articles were those
   missing Altmetric data at the time of data collection. The AAS and
   associated social media impact for each article were collected with the
   AAS calculator bookmarklet. Spearman rank correlation analyses and
   analysis of variance tests were conducted to assess differences in
   various metrics between AJO, JAMAO, and OPH. The study included articles
   published of all document types (article, conference paper, editorial,
   erratum, letter, note, retracted, review, and short survey) and access
   status (open access and not open access).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The correlation between citation counts and
   Altmetric variables including AAS.
   RESULTS A total of 2467 articles were published in the study period.
   There were 351 articles excluded owing to missing Altmetric data. Of the
   2116 articles included in the analysis, 1039 (49.1\%) were published in
   2018, and 1077 (50.9\%) were published in 2019; the mean number of
   citations was 8.8 (95\% CI, 7.9-9.6) for AJO, 6.2 (95\% CI, 5.3-7.1) for
   JAMAO, and 15.1 (95\% CI, 13.3-17.0) for OPH. The mean AAS was 4.5 (95\%
   CI, 3.3-5.6) for AJO (723 publications), 27.4 (95\% CI, 22.1-32.8) for
   JAMAO (758 publications), and 15.1 (95\% CI, 10.9-19.3) for OPH (635
   publications). Citation rate was moderately correlated with AAS across
   the 3 journals (AJO, rho = 0.39; P < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.41; P < .001;
   OPH, rho = 0.40; P < .001), as well as minimally or moderately
   correlated with engagement or mention by Facebook posts (AJO, rho =
   0.38; P < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.24; P < .001; OPH, rho = 0.20; P < .001),
   news outlet reporting (AJO, rho = 0.12; P < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.38; P <
   .001; OPH, rho = 0.19; P < .001), and Twitter posts (AJO, rho = 0.40; P
   < .001; JAMAO, rho = 0.38; P < .001; OPH, rho = 0.42; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this cross-sectional study suggest
   that citation rate has a moderate positive correlation with online and
   social media sharing of research in ophthalmology literature.
   Peer-reviewed journals may increase their reach and impact by sharing
   their literature through social media and online platforms.},

Abstract = {The droplet/wall interaction in the gas channel (GC) of proton exchange
   membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has significant influence on water
   management, which may affect the performance and durability of the cell.
   In this paper, a coupled level-set and volume-of fluid (CLSVOF) method
   is used to simulate the dynamic behaviours of a micro-droplet impacting
   on a vertical wall in the GC. The effects of impact velocity (expressed
   by the Weber number, We), and impact angle on the spreading dynamics are
   evaluated. Next, the critical conditions for the transition from
   spreading to rebound are further discussed. For 0 < We <80, only the
   spreading, retracting, and rebound are observed, and the phenomenon of
   air bubble entrapment is captured on different wettable walls. With an
   increment of We, the maximum total spreading factor l{*} tot and
   corresponding normalised time t{*} will increase, as well as the
   normalised time difference DT2 between the maximum spreading length and
   minimum height. Moreover, when increasing the impact angle, the maximum
   front spreading factor depending on the tangential velocity component
   will decrease, while the absolute value of maximum back spreading factor
   squeezed by the normal velocity component will increase. For the oblique
   downward impact, the front liquid led by the tangential velocity
   component plays a more important role in dominating the spreading
   process. The results also indicate that both the wall wettability and We
   can affect the transition threshold. When the static contact angle is
   between 90 degrees and 150 degrees, the effect of We on the rebound is
   inversely proportional to the hydrophobicity of the wall. (C) 2021

   Malformation: 2-Dimensional Operative Video},

Abstract = {Cavernous malformations located within the brainstem present with a high
   rate of neurological symptoms and carry a more aggressive course in both
   pediatric and adult populations.(,) Cavernomas within the medulla are
   the rarest form, representing only 5\% of all brainstem lesions.
   Repeated hemorrhage of brainstem cavernomas is associated with
   significant and cumulative neurological deficits and thus requires
   treatment. Microsurgical resection has become the optimal mode of
   treatment with the aim of resecting the live malformation and not merely
   the multiaged, organized hematoma. This is best achieved by approaching
   the cavernoma at the location where it projects to the surface and
   entering the lesion through a safe brainstem anatomic zone. For
   ventrally located lesions in the medulla, a transcondylar skull base
   approach provides a direct trajectory to the entry zone through a short
   surgical distance without the need to manipulate or retract
   neurovascular structures. Neuronavigation and intraoperative
   neurophysiological monitoring of somatosensory evoked potential, motor,
   and lower cranial nerves are adjuncts to increase patient safety.
   Radiosurgery for the treatment of brainstem cavernous malformations has
   been proposed; however, it demonstrates high risk and variable and often
   poor response rates. We present a surgical video demonstrating the
   transcondylar approach and resection of a medullary cavernoma in a

Title = {The Seralini affair: degeneration of Science to Re-Science?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {27},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {A paper reporting findings relevant to safety of the genetically
   modified (GM) maize NK603 and the herbicide Roundup (Seralini et al.,
   Food Chem Toxicol. 50:4221-4231, 2012) was retracted against the wishes
   of the authors, and subsequently republished in another peer-reviewed
   journal (Seralini et al. Environ Sci Europe, doi:
   10.1186/s12302-014-0014-5, 2014). These events exemplify a trend in
   which disputes, between interest groups vying for retraction and
   republication of papers that report controversial results, overshadow
   the normal scientific process in which peer-reviewed publication
   stimulates new research, generating new empirical evidence that drives
   the evolution of scientific understanding. This paper reviews the
   current status of research on safety of NK603 maize and Roundup
   herbicide for human and livestock health, and attempts to glean from
   recent developments insights relevant to risk assessment policy for GM
   crops and pesticides, as well as relevant to the scientific process in
   general. Our analysis of currently published evidence confirms NK603 and
   Roundup are kidney and liver toxicants at levels below current
   regulatory thresholds. Consequently, the regulatory status of NK603,
   glyphosate and Roundup requires reevaluation. Additionally, preliminary
   evidence indicates Roundup and NK603, individually and in combination,
   may increase tumor incidence and mortality. Follow-up long-term
   carcinogenicity studies, using test animal strains and numbers of
   animals that assure robust conclusions, are required to confirm/refute
   this preliminary evidence. The inherent tension between the scientific
   process and commercial interests of product developers necessitates
   implementation of safeguards that protect the scientific process and
   prevent degeneration of Science to Re-Science (typified by retraction
   and republication disputes).},

Abstract = {Background-Cardiac stem cells (CSCs) delivered to the infarcted heart
   generate a large number of small fetal-neonatal cardiomyocytes that fail
   to acquire the differentiated phenotype. However, the interaction of
   CSCs with postmitotic myocytes results in the formation of cells with
   adult characteristics.
   Methods and Results-On the basis of results of in vitro and in vivo
   assays, we report that the commitment of human CSCs (hCSCs) to the
   myocyte lineage and the generation of mature working cardiomyocytes are
   influenced by microRNA-499 (miR-499), which is barely detectable in
   hCSCs but is highly expressed in postmitotic human cardiomyocytes.
   miR-499 traverses gap junction channels and translocates to structurally
   coupled hCSCs favoring their differentiation into functionally competent
   cells. Expression of miR-499 in hCSCs represses the miR-499 target genes
   Sox6 and Rod1, enhancing cardiomyogenesis in vitro and after infarction
   in vivo. Although cardiac repair was detected in all cell-treated
   infarcted hearts, the aggregate volume of the regenerated myocyte mass
   and myocyte cell volume were greater in animals injected with hCSCs
   overexpressing miR-499. Treatment with hCSCs resulted in an improvement
   in ventricular function, consisting of a better preservation of
   developed pressure and positive and negative dP/dt after infarction. An
   additional positive effect on cardiac performance occurred with miR-499,
   pointing to enhanced myocyte differentiation/hypertrophy as the
   mechanism by which miR-499 potentiated the restoration of myocardial
   mass and function in the infarcted heart.
   Conclusions-The recognition that miR-499 promotes the differentiation of
   hCSCs into mechanically integrated cardiomyocytes has important clinical
   implications for the treatment of human heart failure. (Circulation.

Title = {Ignored Papers, Invented Quotations: A History of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome},
Journal = {NEONATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 SEP 14},
Abstract = {Given the high rate of alcoholism throughout history, its effects on the
   fetus may have existed for millennia. But, the claim that Greeks and
   Romans were aware of fetal alcohol syndrome rests on incorrect
   citations. From 1725, maternal alcohol consumption was associated with
   retarded fetal growth and neurological anomalies. From 1809, scientists
   followed Lamarck's theory that the disorders parents acquire during
   their lifetime are passed on to their offspring. Fetal effects were
   thought to be inherited mainly from the father. During the 19th century,
   parental alcoholism became associated with malformations. In 1915,
   Ballantyne distinguished genetic influence via germ cells from toxin's
   effect on the embryo. Fetal alcohol syndrome was characterized by
   Rouquette {[}Influence de la toxicomanie alcoolique parentale sur le
   developpement physique et psychique des jeunes enfants] in 1957 and
   Lemoine et al. {[}Ouest Medical. 1968;21:476-482] in 1968 as consisting
   of 4 features: (A) facial anomalies (narrow forehead, retracted upper
   lip, and cupped ears), (B) severe growth retardation (prenatal and
   postnatal), (C) malformations (limbs, cardiac, and visceral), and (D)
   central nervous system anomalies (hyperexcitability and mental
   retardation). But, their studies, written in French, remained
   disregarded. In 1973, Jones et al. {[}Lancet. 1973;302:999-1001]
   reported ``the first association between maternal alcoholism and
   aberrant morphogenesis in the offspring.{''} The history of fetal
   alcohol syndrome reveals shortcomings in citation practice. Alleged
   quotations remained unverified, non-English publications neglected, and
   short quotations taken out of context. Prejudiced by religious and
   abstinence groups, reports on alcohol damage to the unborn were fraught
   with emotions, moralizing, social implications, and presentism, the
   interpretation of past events with present knowledge.},

Abstract = {The bosonic string theory evolved as an attempt to find a
   physical/quantum mechanical model capable of reproducing Euler's beta
   function (Veneziano amplitude) and its multidimensional analogue. The
   multidimensional analogue of beta function was studied mathematically
   for some time from different angles by mathematicians such as Selberg,
   Weil and Deligne among many others. The results of their studies
   apparently were not taken into account in physics literature on string
   theory. In several recent publications, attempts were made to restore
   the missing links. As discussed in these publications, the existing
   mathematical interpretation of the multidimensional analogue of Euler's
   beta function as one of the periods associated with the corresponding
   differential form ``living{''} on the Fermat-type (hyper) surface,
   happens to be crucial for restoration of the quantum/statistical
   mechanical models reproducing such generalized beta function. There is a
   number of nontraditional models-all interrelated-capable of reproducing
   the Veneziano amplitudes. In this work we would like to discuss two of
   such new models: symplectic and supersymmetric. The symplectic model is
   based on observation that the Veneziano amplitude is just the Laplace
   transform of the generating function for the Ehrhart polynomial. Such a
   polynomial counts the number of lattice points inside the rational
   polytope (i.e. polytope whose vertices are located at the nodes of a
   regular lattice) and at its boundaries. In the present case, the
   polytope is a regular simplex. It is a deformation retract for the
   Fermat-type (hyper) surface (perhaps inflated, as explained in the
   text). Using known connections between polytopes and dynamical systems,
   the quantum mechanical system associated with such a dynamical system is
   found. The ground state of this system is degenerate with degeneracy
   factor given by the Ehrhart polynomial. Using some ideas by Atiyah, Bott
   and Witten we argue that the supersymmetric model related to the
   symplectic can be recovered. While recovering this model, we demonstrate
   that the ground state of such a model is degenerate with the same
   degeneracy factor as for earlier obtained symplectic model. Since the
   wave functions of this model are in one to one correspondence with the
   Veneziano amplitudes, this exactly solvable supersymmetric (and, hence,
   also symplectic) model is sufficient for recovery of the partition
   function reproducing the Veneziano amplitudes thus providing the exact
   solution of the Veneziano model.},

Abstract = {Deciphering the mechanisms involved in shaping social structure is key
   to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes leading to
   sociality. Individual specialization within groups can increase colony
   efficiency and consequently productivity. Here, we test the hypothesis
   that within-group variation in individual personalities (i.e. boldness
   and aggression) can shape task differentiation. The social spider
   Stegodyphus sarasinorum (Eresidae) showed task differentiation
   (significant unequal participation) in simulated prey capture events
   across 10-day behavioural assays in the field, independent of
   developmental stage (level of maturation), eliminating age polyethism.
   Participation in prey capture was positively associated with level of
   boldness but not with aggression. Body size positively correlated with
   being the first spider to emerge from the colony as a response to prey
   capture but not with being the first to attack, and dispersal distance
   from experimental colonies correlated with attacking but not with
   emerging. This suggests that different behavioural responses to prey
   capture result from a complex set of individual characteristics.
   Boldness and aggression correlated positively, but neither was
   associated with body size, developmental stage or dispersal distance.
   Hence, we show that personalities shape task differentiation in a social
   spider independent of age and maturation. Our results suggest that
   personality measures obtained in solitary, standardized laboratory
   settings can be reliable predictors of behaviour in a social context in
   the field. Given the wealth of organisms that show consistent individual
   behavioural differences, animal personality could play a role in social
   organization in a diversity of animals.},

Title = {Rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of randomized controlled trials
   in obstetrics and gynecology},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS \& GYNECOLOGY MFM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials are considered the highest
   level of evidence but fewer than half are reproducible. A rigorous
   methodology improves trial quality, but reproducibility may be limited
   by a lack of transparency in reporting. The Consolidated Standards of
   Reporting Trials guidelines define reporting standards, and pretrial
   registration requires a predefined methodology and predefined outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE: We evaluated obstetrics and gynecology trials published in 6
   journals in terms of their adherence to the Consolidated Standards of
   Reporting Trials guidelines. Second, we evaluated pretrial registration
   compliance and concordance between the registry and publication.
   Furthermore, we evaluated the differences in trial characteristics among
   randomized controlled trials with the highest level of compliance and
   those with lower levels of compliance and adherence to guidelines by
   journal type.
   STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of obstetrics and
   gynecology trials published between 2017 and 2019 in 6 journals
   (American Journal of Obstetrics \& Gynecology, BJOG: An International
   Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Obstetrics \& Gynecology, The
   Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, and The New
   England Journal of Medicine). Randomized controlled trials were
   identified via PubMed and manual journal archive searches. The primary
   outcome was adequate compliance with the Consolidated Standards of
   Reporting Trials guidelines defined as >= 80\% of the checklist items
   present. Secondary outcomes included completion of pretrial registration
   and concordance between the pretrial registration and publication in
   terms of the outcomes and sample size. We compared the characteristics
   between trials with adequate compliance and those with inadequate
   compliance. Secondary analyses included comparisons of characteristics
   of the trials in the top quartile for compliance with the Consolidated
   Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines with those of the trials in
   lower quartiles and compliance with guidelines in obstetrics-gynecology
   vs non-obstetrics-gynecology journals. In an exploratory analysis,
   trends in compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
   guidelines across the study period were assessed. A post hoc sensitivity
   analysis evaluated the outcomes after the exclusion of 2 retracted
   trials.
   RESULTS: Of the 170 trials included, 80\% (95\% confidence interval,
   74\%-86\%) were adequately compliant with the Consolidated Standards of
   Reporting Trials manuscript guidelines and 66\% (95\% confidence
   interval, 59\%-73\%) were compliant with the abstract guidelines. Nearly
   all trials (98\%) reported pretrial registration. Concordance between
   pretrial registration and publication in terms of the primary outcomes
   was identified for 77\% of the trials, concordance in terms of the
   secondary outcomes was observed in 32\% of the trials, and concordance
   in terms of sample size was observed in 60\% of the trials. Trials with
   adequate compliance were more likely to be preregistered, include an a
   priori power calculation, and use an intent to treat analysis. Trials in
   the top quartile for compliance with the Consolidated Standards of
   Reporting Trials guidelines were more likely to be multicenter,
   international, and government funded. More trials from
   non-obstetrics-gynecology journals were in the top quartile for
   compliance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
   guidelines than trials from obstetrics-gynecology journals (64.9\% vs
   25.7\%; P<.001). No significant trends in adequate compliance were
   identified across the study period. Results did not differ significantly
   in the sensitivity analysis.
   CONCLUSION: Of all the trials included, 20\% of obstetrics-gynecology
   trials published in 6 high-impact journals were not compliant with the
   Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines, and there were
   major discrepancies between pretrial registration and publication.
   Transparency, reproducibility, and scientific rigor in obstetrics and
   gynecology trial reporting needs to be improved.},

Title = {Retraction of COVID-19 Pharmacoepidemiology Research Could Have Been
   Avoided by Effective Use of Reporting Guidelines},
Journal = {CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {1403-1420},
Abstract = {Introduction: Two recent high-profile publications (and subsequent
   retractions) of pharmacoepidemiology studies reporting the effectiveness
   and risk of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients received
   international media attention. Transparent and complete reporting of
   these studies could have provided peer reviewers and editors with
   sufficient information to question the methods used and the validity of
   results. Since these studies used routinely collected health data, the
   guidelines for the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational
   Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) should have been applied to
   ensure complete reporting of the research.
   Methods: We evaluated the two retracted articles for completeness of
   reporting using the RECORD for Pharmacoepidemiology (RECORD-PE)
   checklist, which includes the check-lists for the STengthening the
   Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) and RECORD.
   We compared the proportion of STROBE, RECORD and RECORD-PE items
   adequately reported using Chi-squared statistics.
   Results: In the article published by The Lancet, 29 of 34 STROBE items
   (85.3\%) were adequately reported, compared with 3.5 of 13 RECORD items
   (26.9\%) and 9.5 of 15 RECORD-PE items (63.3\%)(chi(2) = 14.839, P
   <0.001). Similarly, the article published in NEJM reported 24 of 34
   STROBE items (70.6\%), two of 13 RECORD items (15.4\%), and 7.5 of 15
   RECORD-PE items (50.0\%) (chi(2) = 11.668, P = 0.003). Important aspects
   of the methods unique to research using routinely collected health data
   were not reported, including variables used to identify exposure,
   outcome and confounders, validation of the coding or algorithms, a
   description of the underlying database population and the accuracy of
   data linkage methods.
   Discussion: While STROBE items were generally adequately reported,
   RECORD and RECORD-PE items were not. Reporting guidelines should be
   effectively implemented in order for transparency and completeness of
   research manuscripts, allowing for adequate evaluation by editors and
   peer reviewers.},

Abstract = {The article entitled, ``Using the Healthy Days Measure to Assess Factors
   Associated with Poor Health-Related Quality of Life for Patients with
   Metastatic Breast, Lung, or Colorectal Cancer Enrolled in a Medicare
   Advantage Health Plan,{''} by Casebeer AW et al, which published online
   ahead of print in Population Health Management {[}doi:
   10.1089/pop.2018.0024], is being retracted by the authors so that they
   can remove references to the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
   (MMAS-8) and republish the article without such references.
   Dr. Casebeer's team obtained a license to use the MMAS-8 scale from Dr.
   Morisky prior to conducting the study. Nevertheless, after publication
   of a separate article in the Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes that
   also cited the MMAS-8, as the lead author, Dr. Casebeer was contacted by
   Dr. Morisky who requested that a number of changes be made to the
   article. Dr. Casebeer and her team have no desire to engage in a dispute
   with Dr. Morisky and therefore proactively contacted the Editor of
   Population Health Management and requested that the scale be removed
   from her published paper. After assessing all of the provided
   information, the Editor agreed to the authors' request.
   It is important to note that the retraction of Dr. Casebeer's article is
   not the result of any misconduct on her part or that of her team. The
   retraction serves to remove the published version of the article that
   contains the MMAS-8 scale and a revised version that does not contain
   the tool or any references to it will be published. The elimination of
   the scale does not alter the results or conclusions of the study.
   Population Health Management is committed to upholding the highest
   standards of peer review and the community it serves.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose - Risk of hip fracture after stroke is 2 to 4
   times that in a reference population. Osteomalacia is present in some
   patients with hip fractures in the absence of stroke, while disabled
   elderly stroke patients occasionally have severe deficiency in serum
   concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) (less than or equal to5
   ng/mL). To determine the effects of vitamin D status on hip fracture
   risk, we prospectively studied a cohort of patients with hemiplegia
   after stroke who were aged at least 65 years.
   Methods - We compared baseline serum indices of bone metabolism, bone
   mineral density, and hip fracture occurrence in stroke patients with
   serum 25-OHD less than or equal to 25 nmol/L (\%10 ng/mL; deficient
   group, n=88) with findings in patients from the same cohort who had
   25-OHD levels 26 to 50 nmol/L (10 to 20 ng/mL; insufficient group, n=76)
   or greater than or equal to 51 nmol/L (greater than or equal to 21
   ng/mL; sufficient group, n=72).
   Results - Over a 2-year follow-up interval, hip fractures on the paretic
   side occurred in 7 patients in the deficient group and I patient in the
   insufficient group (P <0.05; hazard ratio=6.5), while no hip fractures
   occurred in the sufficient group. The 7 hip fracture patients in the
   deficient group had an osteomalacic 25-OHD level of <5 ng/mL. Higher age
   and severe immobilization were noted in the deficient group. Serum
   25-OHD levels correlated positively with age, Barthel Index, and serum
   parathyroid hormone.
   Conclusions - Elderly disabled stroke patients with serum 25-OHD
   concentrations less than or equal to 12 nmol/L (less than or equal to5
   ng/mL) have an increased risk of hip fracture. Immobilization and
   advanced age cause severe 25-OHD deficiency and consequent reduction of
   BMD.},

Title = {Online Row Sampling},
Journal = {THEORY OF COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {Finding a small spectral approximation for a tall n x d matrix A is a
   fundamental numerical primitive. For a number of reasons, one often
   seeks an approximation whose rows are sampled from those of A. Row
   sampling improves interpretability, saves space when A is sparse, and
   preserves structure, which is important, e. g., when A represents a
   graph.
   However, correctly sampling rows from A can be costly when the matrix is
   large and cannot be stored and processed in memory. Hence, a number of
   recent publications focus on row sampling in the streaming setting,
   using little more space than what is required to store the returned
   approximation (Kelner-Levin, Theory Comput. Sys. 2013, Kapralov et al.,
   SIAM J. Comp. 2017).
   Inspired by a growing body of work on online algorithms for machine
   learning and data analysis, we extend this work to a more restrictive
   online setting: we read rows of A one by one and immediately decide
   whether each row should be kept in the spectral approximation or
   discarded, without ever retracting these decisions. We present an
   extremely simple algorithm that approximates A up to multiplicative
   error 1 + epsilon and additive error delta using O(d log d log(epsilon
   parallel to A parallel to 2/2/delta)/epsilon(2)) online samples, with
   memory overhead proportional to the cost of storing the spectral
   approximation. We also present an algorithm that uses O(d(2)) memory but

Title = {Histological Correlates of Penile Sexual Sensation: Does Circumcision
   Make a Difference?},
Journal = {SEXUAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {76-85},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction. The question of whether removal of sensory receptors in
   the prepuce by circumcision affects sensitivity and/or sexual pleasure
   is often debated.
   Aims. To examine histological correlates relevant to penile sensitivity
   and sexual pleasure.
   Methods. Systematic review of the scientific literature on penile
   structures that might affect sensitivity and sexual sensation. Articles
   were included if they contained original data on human male penile
   histology or anatomy. Individual articles, including reference lists,
   were evaluated. They were then considered in relation to physiological
   data from articles retrieved by a previous systematic review.
   Results. We retrieved 41 publications on penile structure. Considered in
   the light of 12 reporting physiological measurements, our evaluation
   finds that sexual response is unlikely to involve Meissner's corpuscles,
   whose density in the prepuce diminishes at the time of life when male
   sexual activity is increasing. Free nerve endings also show no
   correlation with sexual response. Because tactile sensitivity of the
   glans decreases with sexual arousal, it is unrelated to sexual
   sensation. Thermal sensitivity seems part of the reward mechanism of
   intercourse. Vibrational sensitivity is not related to circumcision
   status. Observations that penile sexual sensation is higher post
   circumcision are consistent with greater access of genital corpuscles to
   sexual stimuli after removal of the prepuce. This is based on the
   distribution of these corpuscles (which are located in the glans) and,
   in uncircumcised men, the position of the retracted prepuce during
   intercourse, rather than any change in the number of genital corpuscles.
   The scientific literature suggests that any sexual effect of circumcised
   men may depend solely on exposure of the glans and not on the absence of
   the prepuce.
   Conclusion. Based on histological findings and correlates of sexual
   function, loss of the prepuce by circumcision would appear to have no
   adverse effect on sexual pleasure. Our evaluation supports overall
   findings from physiological measurements and survey data.},

Title = {Evaluating the Role and Impact of Health Literacy for Patients
   Undergoing Knee Surgery},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF KNEE SURGERY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Health literacy is defined as ``the capacity to obtain, process, and
   understand basic medical information and services and the competence to
   use such information and services to enhance health.{''} Much of the
   research regarding health literacy in orthopaedic surgery has focused on
   readability of educational materials. However, the role of health
   literacy in patient-reported outcomes is somewhat unknown. The purpose
   of this review was to evaluate the body of literature pertaining to
   health literacy and knee surgery outcomes. A literature search was
   performed using keywords and MeSH terms in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus,
   PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane. Articles written between 1990 and
   2021 were evaluated for inclusion. The title and abstract of all studies
   returned in each database search were screened. In the case that these
   did not provide sufficient information, the full-text article was
   reviewed. The initial database search returned a total of 974 articles
   for review. Eight of these were duplicate results, and one article had
   been retracted after publication, leaving a total of 965 to be screened
   for inclusion. Ninety-six articles remained after screening titles and
   abstracts for relevance. After applying inclusion criteria, six articles
   remained and were included in this review. It is clear that health
   literacy impacts patient outcomes in health care and this review
   suggests that general and musculoskeletal health literacy affect patient
   expectations, outcomes, and satisfaction before and after knee surgery.
   However, the peer-reviewed literature on this topic is still deficient
   in terms of determining effective methods for addressing this barrier to
   optimal patient care. Research should focus on further elucidation of
   the relationships among health literacy, readability, and patient
   education for optimizing patient outcomes and satisfaction across
   orthopaedic subspecialties.},

Title = {Development of a Quality Risk Based Tool for the Selection of Regulatory

Journal = {ORGANIC PROCESS RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {The selection of regulatory starting materials (RSMs) is a critical step
   in determining where the drug substance manufacturing process begins as
   it relates to the submission and approval of the commercial marketing
   application and with it the formal expectations for Good Manufacturing
   Practice (GMP) processing. The determination of RSMs can be very
   challenging and is often subject to significant debate both within
   pharmaceutical manufacturing organizations and with regulatory bodies
   that review the commercial marketing application. The use of quality
   risk management (QRM) as described in ICH Q9 can help provide a process
   for assessing the RSM attributes and their relationship to the critical
   quality attributes (CQAs) of both the final drug substance and the drug
   product. This publication presents a standardized risk assessment tool
   developed by Merck \& Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (MSD) that
   facilitates the RSM decision-making process on the basis of principles
   described in ICH Q10 and ICH Q11. The MSD RSM tool was designed to take
   into account the current regulatory landscape, evolved over time as the
   landscape dictates, while providing a systematic evaluation of the
   suitability of proposed RSMs to enable their judicious selection. The
   MSD RSM tool can be used for new chemical entities (NCEs) submitted for
   commercial approval or for in-line products going through postapproval
   changes. The MSD RSM tool provides a total score that is used to assess
   the alignment with the starting material selection principles in ICH Q11
   and the EMA reflection paper, which was retracted by EMA after the ICH
   Q11 Q\&A was issued. The level of alignment should generally correspond
   with the likelihood that an RSM will be accepted by regulatory agencies
   in the commercial marketing application.},

Abstract = {The high mountains of Asia-encompassing the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush,
   Karakoram, Pamir Alai, Kunlun Shan, and Tian Shan mountains-have the
   highest concentration of glaciers globally, and 800 million people
   depend in part on meltwater from them. Water stress makes this region
   vulnerable economically and socially to drought, but glaciers are a
   uniquely drought-resilient source of water. Here I show that these
   glaciers provide summer meltwater to rivers and aquifers that is
   sufficient for the basic needs of 136 million people, or most of the
   annual municipal and industrial needs of Pakistan, Tajikistan,
   Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. During drought summers,
   meltwater dominates water inputs to the upper Indus and Aral river
   basins. Uncertainties in mountain precipitation are poorly known, but,
   given the magnitude of this water supply, predicted glacier loss would
   add considerably to drought-related water stress. Such additional water
   stress increases the risk of social instability, conflict and sudden,
   uncontrolled population migrations triggered by water scarcity, which is
   already associated with the large and rapidly growing populations and
   hydroeconomies of these basins.},

Abstract = {Predicting the responses of streamflow to changes in forest management
   is fundamental to the sustainable regulation of water resources.
   However, studies of changes in forest cover have yielded unclear and
   largely unpredictable results. Here we compile a comprehensive and
   spatially distributed database of forest-management studies worldwide,
   to assess the factors that control streamflow response to forest
   planting and removal. We introduce a vegetation-to-bedrock model that
   includes seven key landscape factors in order to explain the impacts of
   forest removal and planting on water yield. We show that the amount of
   water stored in a landscape is the most important factor in predicting
   streamflow response to forest removal, whereas the loss of water through
   evaporation and transpiration is the most important factor in predicting
   streamflow response to forest planting. Our findings affect model
   parameterizations in climate change mitigation schemes ( involving, for
   example, afforestation or deforestation) in different geologic and
   climate regions around the world, and inform practices for the
   sustainable management of water resources.},

Abstract = {Akt is a serine threonine kinase with a major role in transducing
   survival signals and regulating proteins involved in apoptosis. To find
   new interactors of Akt involved in cell survival, we performed a
   two-hybrid screening in yeast using human full-length Akt c-DNA as bait
   and a murine c-DNA library as prey. Among the 80 clones obtained, two
   were identified as Bcl-w. Bcl-w is a member of the Bcl-2 family that is
   essential for the regulation of cellular survival, and that is
   up-regulated in different human tumors, such as gastric and colorectal
   carcinomas. Direct interaction of Bcl-w with Akt was confirmed by
   immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequently, we addressed the function of
   this interaction: by interfering with the activity or amount of Akt, we
   have demonstrated that Akt modulates the amount of Bcl-w protein. We
   have found that inhibition of Akt activity may promote apoptosis through
   the downregulation of Bcl-w protein and the consequential reduction in
   interaction of Bcl-w with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Our
   data provide evidence that Bcl-w is a new member of the Akt pathway and
   that Akt may induce anti-apoptotic signals at least in part through the
   regulation of the amount and activity of Bcl-w.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, the Parkinson's disease (PD) symptom course has been
   classified as an irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease.
   This paper documents 29 PD and treatment-induced systemic depletion
   etiologies which cause and/or exacerbate the seven novel primary
   relative nutritional deficiencies associated with PD. These reversible
   relative nutritional deficiencies (RNDs) may facilitate and accelerate
   irreversible progressive neurodegeneration, while other reversible RNDs
   may induce previously undocumented reversible pseudo-neurodegeneration
   that is hiding in plain sight since the symptoms are identical to the
   symptoms being experienced by the PD patient. Documented herein is a
   novel nutritional approach for reversible processes management which may
   slow or halt irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disease and
   correct reversible RNDs whose symptoms are identical to the patient's PD
   symptoms.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of gastrectomy
   (GX) on cortical and cancellous bones in rats. Twenty male
   Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into the two groups of 10 animals
   each: a sham operation (control) group and a GX group. Seven weeks after
   surgery, the bone mineral content and density (BMC and BMD, resp.) and
   the mechanical strength of the femur were determined, and bone
   histomorphometric analyses were performed on the tibia. GX induced
   decreases in the BMC, BMD, ultimate force, work to failure, and
   stiffness of the femoral distal metaphysis and the BMC, BMD, and
   ultimate force of the femoral diaphysis. GX induced a decrease in
   cancellous bone mass, characterized by an increased osteoid thickness,
   osteoid surface, osteoid volume, and bone formation. GX also induced a
   decrease in cortical bone mass, characterized by increased endocortical
   bone resorption. The GX induced reductions in the bone mass and strength
   parameters were greater in cancellous bone than in cortical bone. The
   present study showed that the response of bone formation, resorption,
   and osteoid parameters to GX and the degree of GX-induced osteopenia and
   the deterioration of bone strength appeared to differ between cortical
   and cancellous bones in rats.},

Abstract = {Urinary dopamine fluctuations in the competitive inhibition state were
   first documented in 2009. At that time, it was noted that progressively
   higher daily dosing values of L-tyrosine decreased the magnitude of
   these fluctuations. While extensive statistical analysis has been
   performed by the authors since 2004, it was not until 2012 that a
   plausible explanation was formulated. In the process, correlations with
   L-tyrosine administration and the on/off effect of Parkinson's disease
   were defined. This paper documents the current knowledge with regard to
   the management of retrograde phase 1 dopamine fluctuations and
   investigates the hypothesis that they are caused by a melanin steal

Abstract = {Rationale: Chronic rejection, accelerated coronary atherosclerosis,
   myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart failure determine the
   unfavorable evolution of the transplanted heart in humans.
   Objective: Here we tested whether the pathological manifestations of the
   transplanted heart can be corrected partly by a strategy that implements
   the use of cardiac progenitor cells from the recipient to repopulate the
   donor heart with immunocompatible cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels.
   Methods and Results: A large number of cardiomyocytes and coronary
   vessels were created in a rather short period of time from the delivery,
   engraftment, and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells from the
   recipient. A proportion of newly formed cardiomyocytes acquired adult
   characteristics and was integrated structurally and functionally within
   the transplant. Similarly, the regenerated arteries, arterioles, and
   capillaries were operative and contributed to the oxygenation of the
   chimeric myocardium. Attenuation in the extent of acute damage by
   repopulating cardiomyocytes and vessels decreased significantly the
   magnitude of myocardial scarring preserving partly the integrity of the
   donor heart.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that tissue regeneration by
   differentiation of recipient cardiac progenitor cells restored a
   significant portion of the rejected donor myocardium. Ultimately,
   immunosuppressive therapy may be only partially required improving
   quality of life and lifespan of patients with cardiac transplantation.

Abstract = {Background Aging negatively impacts on the function of resident human
   cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs). Effective regeneration of the injured
   heart requires mobilization of hCPCs to the sites of damage. In the
   young heart, signaling by the guidance receptor EphA2 in response to the
   ephrin A1 ligand promotes hCPC motility and improves cardiac recovery
   after infarction.
   Methods and Results We report that old hCPCs are characterized by
   cell-autonomous inhibition of their migratory ability ex vivo and
   impaired translocation in vivo in the damaged heart. EphA2 expression
   was not decreased in old hCPCs; however, the elevated level of reactive
   oxygen species in aged cells induced post-translational modifications of
   the EphA2 protein. EphA2 oxidation interfered with ephrin A1-stimulated
   receptor auto-phosphorylation, activation of Src family kinases, and
   caveolin-1-mediated internalization of the receptor. Cellular aging
   altered the EphA2 endocytic route, affecting the maturation of
   EphA2-containing endosomes and causing premature signal termination.
   Overexpression of functionally intact EphA2 in old hCPCs corrected the
   defects in endocytosis and downstream signaling, enhancing cell
   motility. Based on the ability of phenotypically young hCPCs to respond
   efficiently to ephrin A1, we developed a novel methodology for the
   prospective isolation of live hCPCs with preserved migratory capacity
   and growth reserve.
   Conclusions Our data demonstrate that the ephrin A1/EphA2 pathway may
   serve as a target to facilitate trafficking of hCPCs in the senescent
   myocardium. Importantly, EphA2 receptor function can be implemented for
   the selection of hCPCs with high therapeutic potential, a clinically
   relevant strategy that does not require genetic manipulation of stem
   cells.},

Abstract = {Rationale: Embryonic and fetal myocardial growth is characterized by a
   dramatic increase in myocyte number, but whether the expansion of the
   myocyte compartment is dictated by activation and commitment of resident
   cardiac stem cells (CSCs), division of immature myocytes or both is
   currently unknown.
   Objective: In this study, we tested whether prenatal cardiac development
   is controlled by activation and differentiation of CSCs and whether
   division of c-kit-positive CSCs in the mouse heart is triggered by
   spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations.
   Methods and Results: We report that embryonic-fetal c-kit-positive CSCs
   are self-renewing, clonogenic and multipotent in vitro and in vivo. The
   growth and commitment of c-kit-positive CSCs is responsible for the
   generation of the myocyte progeny of the developing heart. The close
   correspondence between values computed by mathematical modeling and
   direct measurements of myocyte number at E9, E14, E19 and 1 day after
   birth strongly suggests that the organogenesis of the embryonic heart is
   dependent on a hierarchical model of cell differentiation regulated by
   resident CSCs. The growth promoting effects of c-kit-positive CSCs are
   triggered by spontaneous oscillations in intracellular Ca2+, mediated by
   IP3 receptor activation, which condition asymmetrical stem cell division
   and myocyte lineage specification.
   Conclusions: Myocyte formation derived from CSC differentiation is the
   major determinant of cardiac growth during development. Division of
   c-kit-positive CSCs in the mouse is promoted by spontaneous Ca2+ spikes,
   which dictate the pattern of stem cell replication and the generation of
   a myocyte progeny at all phases of prenatal life and up to one day after
   birth. (Circ Res. 2012;110:701-715.)},

Abstract = {Deblending plays an important role in preparing high-quality seismic
   data from modern blended simultaneous-source seismic acquisition.
   State-of-the-art deblending is based on the sparsity-constrained
   iterative inversion. Inversion-based deblending assumes that the ambient
   noise level is low and the data misfit during iterative inversion
   accounts for the random ambient noise. The traditional method becomes
   problematic when the random ambient noise becomes extremely strong and
   the inversion iteratively fits the random noise instead of the signal
   and blending interference. We propose a constrained inversion model that
   takes the strong random noise into consideration and can achieve
   satisfactory result even when strong random noise exists. The principle
   of this new method is that we use sparse dictionaries to learn the
   blending spikes and thus the learned dictionary atoms are able to
   distinguish between blending spikes and random noise. The separated
   signal and blending spikes can then be better fitted by the iterative
   inversion framework. Synthetic and field data examples are used to
   demonstrate the performance of the new approach.},

Abstract = {For nearly a century, the human heart has been viewed as a terminally
   differentiated postmitotic organ in which the number of cardiomyocytes
   is established at birth, and these cells persist throughout the lifespan
   of the organ and organism. However, the discovery that cardiac stem
   cells live in the heart and differentiate into the various cardiac cell
   lineages has changed profoundly our understanding of myocardial biology.
   Cardiac stem cells regulate myocyte turnover and condition myocardial
   recovery after injury. This novel information imposes a reconsideration
   of the mechanisms involved in myocardial aging and the progression of
   cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure. Similarly, the processes
   implicated in the adaptation of the infarcted heart have to be dissected
   in terms of the critical role that cardiac stem cells and myocyte
   regeneration play in the restoration of myocardial mass and ventricular
   function. Several categories of cardiac progenitors have been described
   but, thus far, the c-kit-positive cell is the only class of resident
   cells with the biological and functional properties of tissue specific
   adult stem cells. (Circ Res. 2011;109:941-961.)},

Abstract = {SIRT6 belongs to the sirtuin family of protein lysine deacetylases,
   which regulate aging and genome stability. We found that human SIRT6 has
   a role in promoting DNA end resection, a crucial step in DNA
   double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination. SIRT6
   depletion impaired the accumulation of replication protein A and
   single-stranded DNA at DNA damage sites, reduced rates of homologous
   recombination, and sensitized cells to DSB-inducing agents. We
   identified the DSB resection protein CtIP {[}C-terminal binding protein
   (CtBP) interacting protein] as a SIRT6 interaction partner and showed
   that SIRT6-dependent CtIP deacetylation promotes resection. A
   nonacetylatable CtIP mutant alleviated the effect of SIRT6 depletion on
   resection, thus identifying CtIP as a key substrate by which SIRT6
   facilitates DSB processing and homologous recombination. These findings
   further clarify how SIRT6 promotes genome stability.},

Abstract = {Neuroblastoma is a common pediatric malignancy that accounts for similar
   to 15\% of tumor-related deaths in children. The tumor is generally
   believed to originate from neural crest cells during early sympathetic
   neurogenesis. As the degree of neuroblastoma differentiation has been
   correlated with clinical outcome, clarifying the molecular mechanisms
   that drive neuroblastoma progression and differentiation is important
   for increasing the survival of these patients. In a previous study, the
   authors identified paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) as a key mediator of
   neuroblastoma pathogenesis in a TH-MYCN mouse model. In the present
   study, they aimed to define whether PHOX2B is also associated with
   proliferation and differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells. PHOX2B
   expression in neuroblastoma cells was evaluated by immunoblot analyses,
   and the effects of PHOX2B on the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells in
   vitro were determined using clonogenic and sphere formation assays.
   Xenograft experiments in NOD/SCID mice were used to examine the in vivo
   response to PHOX2B knockdown. Their data demonstrated that PHOX2B acts
   as a prognostic marker in neuroblastoma and that retinoic acid-induced
   neuronal differentiation downregulates PHOX2B expression, thereby
   suppressing the self-renewal capacity of neuroblastoma cells and
   inhibiting tumorigenicity. These findings confirmed that PHOX2B is a key
   regulator of neuroblastoma differentiation and stemness maintenance and
   indicated that PHOX2B might serve as a potential therapeutic target in
   neuroblastoma patients.},

Abstract = {Despite partial success, communication has remained impossible for
   persons suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and
   emotional processing, a state called complete locked-in state (CLIS).
   Based on a motor learning theoretical context and on the failure of
   neuroelectric brain-computer interface (BCI) communication attempts in
   CLIS, we here report BCI communication using functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an implicit attentional processing procedure.
   Four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   (ALS)-two of them in permanent CLIS and two entering the CLIS with-out
   reliable means of communication - learned to answer personal questions
   with known answers and open questions all requiring a ``yes{''}or
   ``no{''} thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with
   fNIRS. Three patients completed more than 46 sessions spread over
   several weeks, and one patient (patient W) completed 20 sessions. Online
   fNIRS classification of personal questions with known answers and open
   questions using linear support vector machine (SVM) resulted in an
   above-chance-level correct response rate over 70\%.
   Electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did
   not exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite
   occasional differences between the physiological signals representing a
   ``yes{''} or ``no{''} response. However, electro-encephalogram (EEG)
   changes in the theta-frequency band correlated with inferior
   communication performance, probably because of decreased vigilance and
   attention. If replicated with ALS patients in CLIS, these positive
   results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete
   locked-in states, at least for ALS.},

Abstract = {Background: COVID-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without
   sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. Method:
   We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli
   field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions
   (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch
   National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting
   severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects.
   Result: The NNTV is between 200-700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for
   the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the NNTV to prevent one death
   is between 9000 and 50,000 (95\% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a
   point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has
   been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16
   serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal
   side effects is at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented
   by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination.
   Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to
   rethink their vaccination policy.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose Vitamin K is an essential factor for synthesis of
   plasma clotting proteins and for site-specific carboxylation of bone Gla
   protein and other bone matrix proteins. Low vitamin It has been
   associated with reduced bone mineral density. Warfarin therapy, which
   inhibits vitamin K-dependent blood-clotting, has been demonstrated to
   reduce the risk of stroke in nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. We
   evaluated vitamin ii and bone mineral density in nonrheumatic atrial
   fibrillation patients who had long-term warfarin therapy after an
   ischemic stroke.
   Methods Sera were collected from 61 patients with nonrheumatic atrial
   fibrillation and ischemic stroke who had been treated with warfarin, 63
   stroke patients without warfarin, and 39 control subjects. All stroke
   patients in both groups had hemiplegia. Sera were assayed for vitamins
   K-1 and K-2 bone Gla protein, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Bone mineral
   density was determined in both second metacarpals.
   Results Serum vitamin K-1 concentrations (ng/mL) were lower in treated
   patients (.234 +/- .177 ng/mL) than in untreated patients (.329 +/-
   .284) or controls (.553 +/- .164). Bone Gla protein was lower in treated
   patients' sera (1.241 +/- .799 ng/ml) than in untreated patients (4.476
   +/- 3.226), Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were lower in both
   patient groups. Bone mineral density was lower on both sides in treated
   patients than in untreated patients (P < .0001). Vitamin K-1, and bone
   Gla protein were significantly related to bone mineral density
   bilaterally in treated but not in untreated patients.
   Conclusions Bone mineral density was significantly lower in stroke
   patients with long-term warfarin treatment than in untreated patients,
   Both warfarin-induced reduction in vitamin K function and lowered
   vitamin K-1 concentration are probable causes of this osteopenia.},

Abstract = {DNA methylation and demethylation play a critical role in the regulation
   of the molecular pathogenesis of gliomas. Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase
   1 (TET1) catalyses the sequential oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine, (5hmC) leading to eventual DNA demethylation.
   It has been reported that TET1 is a tumour suppressor in several
   cancers. However, whether TET1 plays a role in glioma development is
   largely unclear. Different glioma specimens and corresponding normal
   controls were collected to analyse the expression of TET1. At the same
   time, TET1 of glioma U251 cells was knocked down or over-expressed to
   observe its effect on glioma cell proliferation and invasion as well as
   autophagy level. Here, we reported that the expression of TET1 in glioma
   tissue was significantly lower than the corresponding non-tumour normal
   tissues, and the concentration of TET1 is negatively correlated with the
   glioma WHO classification. When TET1 gene in glioma U251 cells was
   knocked down by CRISPR/Caspase-9 system, the proliferation and invasive
   ability of U251 increased remarkably. But when TET1 was overexpressed in
   U251 cells, the proliferation and invasion were impaired. Following the
   down-expression of TET1, the level of autophagy in U251 cells decreased
   accordingly. However, when TET1 was overexpressed in U251 cells, the
   level of autophagy incraesed. Furthermore, bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) but
   not 3-methyladenine (3-MA) could decrease the autophagy level of
   TET1(-/-) U251 cells as the wild-type controls. It suggests that the
   tumour suppressor effect of TET1 seems to be mediated by regulating the
   level of autophagy, and the regulation of TET1 on autophagy is at an
   early stage.},

Abstract = {Background and Purpose Little is known about bone changes in hemiplegic
   stroke patients. We evaluated the vitamin D status and bone changes on
   the hemiplegic and intact sides of stroke patients.
   Methods Sera were collected from 87 hemiplegic stroke patients (42
   outpatients and 45 inpatients) and from 28 control subjects. The sera
   were assayed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). Bone density was measured
   bilaterally from radiographs of the hands. Diet and sunlight exposure
   were assessed for all subjects.
   Results Serum 25-OHD concentrations were lower in patients (9.1 +/- 4.9
   ng/mL for outpatients, 5.9 +/- 4.1 ng/mL for inpatients) than in control
   subjects (21.6 +/- 3.1 ng/mL). The difference in serum 25-OHD between
   the two patient groups also was statistically significant. The patients'
   microdensitometric scores for osteopenia were higher on the hemiplegic
   side than on the non-hemiplegic side. The microdensitometric scores and
   their side-to-side differences in patients correlated negatively with
   the serum 25-OHD concentration and positively with the degree of
   paralysis. Dietary intake of vitamin D was below the recommended level
   in 72\% of the patients, and 89\% of the patients were considered
   sunlight-deprived.
   Conclusions Bone mass was reduced significantly on the hemiplegic side
   in the stroke patients, which might increase the risk of hip fracture.
   Vitamin D deficiency and disuse are the probable causes of osteopenia in
   this population. The hypovitaminosis D might be corrected readily by
   routine use of vitamin D supplements.},

Abstract = {Rationale: Understanding the mechanisms that regulate trafficking of
   human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) may lead to development of new
   therapeutic approaches for the failing heart.
   Objective: We tested whether the motility of hCSCs in immunosuppressed
   infarcted animals is controlled by the guidance system that involves the
   interaction of Eph receptors with ephrin ligands.
   Methods and Results: Within the cardiac niches, cardiomyocytes expressed
   preferentially the ephrin A1 ligand, whereas hCSCs possessed the EphA2
   receptor. Treatment of hCSCs with ephrin A1 resulted in the rapid
   internalization of the ephrin A1-EphA2 complex, posttranslational
   modifications of Src kinases, and morphological changes consistent with
   the acquisition of a motile cell phenotype. Ephrin A1 enhanced the
   motility of hCSCs in vitro, and their migration in vivo following acute
   myocardial infarction. At 2 weeks after infarction, the volume of the
   regenerated myocardium was 2-fold larger in animals injected with ephrin
   A1-activated hCSCs than in animals receiving control hCSCs; this
   difference was dictated by a greater number of newly formed
   cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels. The increased recovery in
   myocardial mass with ephrin A1-treated hCSCs was characterized by
   further restoration of cardiac function and by a reduction in arrhythmic
   events.
   Conclusions: Ephrin A1 promotes the motility of EphA2-positive hCSCs,
   facilitates their migration to the area of damage, and enhances cardiac
   repair. Thus, in situ stimulation of resident hCSCs with ephrin A1 or
   their ex vivo activation before myocardial delivery improves cell
   targeting to sites of injury, possibly providing a novel strategy for
   the management of the diseased heart. (Circ Res. 2011;108:1071-1083.)},

Abstract = {Freshwater emits substantial volumes of CO2 to the atmosphere. This has
   largely gone unnoticed in global carbon budgets. My aim was to quantify
   the CO2 emanating from freshwater from 66 degrees N to 47 degrees S
   latitudes via in situ bacterial respiration (BR). I determined BR (n =
   326) as a function of water temperature. Freshwater is emitting CO2 at a
   rate of 58.5 Pg C y(-1) (six times that of fossil fuel burning). Most is
   emitted from the Northern Hemisphere. This is because the high northern
   summer temperatures coincide with most of the world's freshwater.
   Diffuse DOC sources, for example dust, may be driving high freshwater
   BR. However, many sources remain elusive and not individually quantified
   in the literature. We must include freshwater CO2 emissions in climate
   models. Identifying, quantifying and managing freshwater's diffuse
   sources of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) will hopefully provide us with
   another opportunity to change our current climate trajectory.},

Abstract = {Effective and efficient arrival picking plays an important role in
   microseismic and earthquake data processing and imaging. Widely used
   short-term-average long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA) based arrival
   picking algorithms suffer from the sensitivity to moderate-to-strong
   random ambient noise. To make the state-of-the-art arrival picking
   approaches effective, microseismic data need to be first pre-processed,
   for example, removing sufficient amount of noise, and second analysed by
   arrival pickers. To conquer the noise issue in arrival picking for weak
   microseismic or earthquake event, I leverage the machine learning
   techniques to help recognizing seismic waveforms in microseismic or
   earthquake data. Because of the dependency of supervised machine
   learning algorithm on large volume of well-designed training data, I
   utilize an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to help cluster the
   time samples into two groups, that is, waveform points and non-waveform
   points. The fuzzy clustering algorithm has been demonstrated to be
   effective for such purpose. A group of synthetic, real microseismic and
   earthquake data sets with different levels of complexity show that the
   proposed method is much more robust than the state-of-the-art STA/LTA
   method in picking microseismic events, even in the case of moderately
   strong background noise.},

Abstract = {The photocatalytic C-F functionalization of highly fluorinated arenes is
   a powerful method for accessing functionalized multifluorinated arenes.
   The decisive step in the determining regioselectivity in fluorine
   functionalization is fluoride fragmentation from the radical anion of
   the multifluorinated arene. To date, the availability of regioisomers
   has been dictated by the innate electronics of the fluorinated arene,
   limiting the synthetic utility of the chemistry. This study investigates
   the remarkable ability of a strategically located hydrogen bond to
   transcend the normal regioselectivity of the C-F functionalization
   event. A significant rate acceleration is additionally observed for
   hydrodefluorination of fluorines that can undergo intramolecular
   hydrogen bonds that form 5-8-membered cycles with moderately acidic
   N-H's. The hydrogen bond is expected to facilitate the fragmentation not
   only by bending the C-F bond of the radical anion out of planarity but
   also by increasing the exothermicity of the fluoride extrusion step
   through protonation of the naked fluoride. Finally, the synthetic
   utility of the method is demonstrated in an expedited synthesis of the
   trifluorinated alpha-phenyl acetic acid derivative required for the
   commercial synthesis of Januvia, an antidiabetic drug. This represents
   the first synthesis of a commercially important multifluorinated arene
   via a defluorination strategy and is significantly shorter than the
   current strategy.},

Title = {Selection criteria for surgical correction of equinovarus foot in adults
   with brain damage: A systematic scoping review},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Objective: To report on preoperative outcomes that guide the choice of
   surgical techniques to correct equinovarus foot in adults with brain
   injury. Methods: Four databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, PEDro) were
   searched according to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies were included
   regardless of their level of proof, with no limitation on date of
   publication, and their quality was assessed with the Methodological
   Index for Non-Randomized Studies score. Results: We analysed 61 studies
   (n = 2,293 participants); 523 participants underwent neurotomy, 437 calf
   musculotendinous lengthening, and 888 tibialis anterior transfer or
   alternative anterior transfers with the flexor digitorum/hallucis longus
   (n = 249), the extensor hallucis longus (n = 102), the tibialis
   posterior (n = 41) and the peroneus longus (n = 41). Two studies were
   dedicated to osteoarticular surgeries (n = 12 participants). Ankle
   dorsiflexors motricity was assessed before 70\% of neurotomies as
   compared with 29\% before isolated calf lengthening studies, their
   strength being at least 3/5 in 33\% and 50\% of the studies concerned,
   respectively. Passive ankle dorsiflexion was assessed before surgery in
   87\% of neurotomy studies, with 62\% of studies investigating
   non-retracted spastic equinovarus foot. Before anterior tendon transfer
   with the tibialis anterior or another muscle, passive ankle dorsiflexion
   was reported in only 20\% and 46\% of studies, respectively, and dynamic
   tibialis anterior activation during gait in 46\% and 56\%. Although
   voluntary recruitment of the tibialis anterior produced a better
   functional result, the presence/correction of varus justified its
   transfer in 60\% of studies as compared with 30\% in other transfers,
   which were justified by hyperactivity or voluntary recruitment of
   transferred muscle. Conclusions: This review highlights the poor level
   of preoperative assessment and the absence of formal criteria to
   indicate the different surgical approaches in the management of
   equinovarus foot. It reinforces the interest of a systematic
   standardized preoperative assessment such as selective motor block and
   dynamic electromyography to choose the most suitable surgical procedure.

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare sildenafil plus hydration with hydration alone in
   improving the amniotic fluid index and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies
   complicated by idiopathic oligohydramnios ( amniotic fluid index less
   than 5 cm without underlying maternal or fetal causes and with normal
   fetal growth).
   METHODS: This was an open-label randomized trial for women carrying
   singleton pregnancies at 30 weeks of gestation or more with idiopathic
   oligohydramnios detected during routine ultrasonogram. Women received
   either oral sildenafil citrate (25 mg every 8 hours) plus intravenous
   infusion of 2 L isotonic solution or fluids only until delivery. The
   primary study outcome was the amniotic fluid volume at 6 weeks of
   follow-up or the final volume before delivery, whichever occurred first.
   Secondary outcomes were duration of pregnancy prolongation, mode of
   delivery, and select neonatal outcomes. The study was powered to detect
   a 45\% difference between groups, so, at an a level of 0.05 and 80\%
   power, a sample size of 167 women was required.
   RESULTS: From February 24, 2015, through April 2016, 196 women were
   screened and 184 were randomized. Follow-up was completed in 166 (90\%):
   82 in the sildenafil group and 84 in the hydration group. Baseline
   characteristics were similar between groups. The amniotic fluid volume
   was higher in the sildenafil group at the final assessment (11.5
   compared with 5.4 cm, P=.02). The sildenafil group delivered later (38.3
   compared with 36.0 weeks of gestation, P=.001), had a lower rate of
   cesarean delivery (28\% compared with 73\%), and their neonates were
   less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (11\%
   compared with 41\%, P=.001).
   CONCLUSION: Sildenafil citrate increases amniotic fluid volume in
   pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios.},

Abstract = {There is concern regarding neurotoxicity induced by the use of local
   anesthetics. A previous study showed that an overload of intracellular
   calcium is involved in the neurotoxic effect of some anesthetics. T-type
   calcium channels, which lower the threshold of action potentials, can
   regulate the influx of calcium ions. We hypothesized that T-type calcium
   channels are involved in bupivacaine-induced neurotoxicity. In this
   study, we first investigated the effects of different concentrations of
   bupivacaine on SH-SY5Y cell viability, and established a cell injury
   model with 1 mM bupivacaine. The cell viability of SH-SY5Y cells was
   measured following treatment with 1 mM bupivacaine and/or different
   dosages (10, 50, or 100 mu M) of NNC 55-0396 dihydrochloride, an
   antagonist of T-type calcium channels for 24 h. In addition, we
   monitored the release of lactate dehydrogenase, cytosolic Ca2+
   ({[}Ca2+](i)), cell apoptosis and caspase-3 expression. SH-SY5Y cells
   pretreated with different dosages (10, 50, or 100 mu M) of NNC 55-0396
   dihydrochloride improved cell viability, reduced lactate dehydrogenase

Abstract = {Background: Domestication and improvement processes, accompanied by
   selections and adaptations, have generated genome-wide divergence and
   stratification in soybean populations. Simultaneously, soybean
   populations, which comprise diverse subpopulations, have developed their
   own adaptive characteristics enhancing fitness, resistance, agronomic
   traits, and morphological features. The genetic traits underlying these
   characteristics play a fundamental role in improving other soybean
   populations. Results: This study focused on identifying the selection
   signatures and adaptive characteristics in soybean populations. A core
   set of 245 accessions (112 wild-type, 79 landrace, and 54 improvement
   soybeans) selected from 4,234 soybean accessions was re-sequenced. Their
   genomic architectures were examined according to the domestication and
   improvement, and accessions were then classified into 3 wild-type, 2
   landrace, and 2 improvement subgroups based on various population
   analyses. Selection and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that the
   landrace subgroups have selection signals for soybean-cyst nematode HG
   type 0 and seed development with germination, and that the improvement
   subgroups have selection signals for plant development with viability
   and seed development with embryo development, respectively. The adaptive
   characteristic for soybean-cyst nematode was partially underpinned by
   multiple resistance accessions, and the characteristics related to seed
   development were supported by our phenotypic findings for seed weights.
   Furthermore, their adaptive characteristics were also confirmed as
   genome-based evidence, and unique genomic regions that exhibit distinct
   selection and selective sweep patterns were revealed for 13 candidate
   genes. Conclusions: Although our findings require further biological
   validation, they provide valuable information about soybean breeding
   strategies and present new options for breeders seeking donor lines to
   improve soybean populations.},

Abstract = {We propose a new low-rank based noise attenuation method using an
   efficient algorithm for tracking subspaces from highly corrupted seismic
   observations. The subspace tracking algorithm requires only basic linear
   algebraic manipulations. The algorithm is derived by analysing
   incremental gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces.
   When the multidimensional seismic data are mapped to a low-rank space,
   the subspace tracking algorithm can be directly applied to the input
   low-rank matrix to estimate the useful signals. Since the subspace
   tracking algorithm is an online algorithm, it is more robust to random
   noise than traditional truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD)
   based subspace tracking algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art
   algorithms, the proposed denoising method can obtain better performance.
   More specifically, the proposed method outperforms the TSVD-based
   singular spectrum analysis method in causing less residual noise and
   also in saving half of the computational cost. Several synthetic and
   field data examples with different levels of complexities demonstrate
   the effectiveness and robustness of the presented algorithm in rejecting
   different types of noise including random noise, spiky noise, blending
   noise, and coherent noise.},

Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered as one of the most common neural
   degenerative diseases in human. Although the continuous investigations
   about AD have been made in recent decades, the pathogenesis of this
   disease is still not definitely confirmed. MicroRNA-125b (miR-125b) is
   extensive expressed in many types of human tissues and played pivotal
   regulatory roles in diverse biological process. In the present study, we
   aimed to explore the roles of miR-125b in regulating neurons cell
   apoptosis under AD condition. The possible molecular mechanisms were
   also investigated. We found that miR-125b was up-regulated in patients
   with AD. Transfection with miR-125b significantly enhanced the apoptosis
   of neurons cells and phosphorylation of Tau by activation of
   cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and p35/25. Forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1) was
   the direct target gene of miR-125b, which involved in the effects of
   miR-125b on neurons cell apoptosis and phosphorylation of Tau. Our
   research interpreted the mechanism of up-regulation of miR-125b in
   pathological Tau phosphorylation and AD occurrence. miR-125b may be a
   novel regulator of AD progress and could be as a therapeutic target for
   AD therapy.},

Abstract = {Background: The monoamines serotonin and dopamine are known to exist in
   two separate states: the endogenous state and the competitive inhibition
   state. The presence of the competitive inhibition state has been known
   to science for many years, but from a functional standpoint it has been
   noted in the literature as being ``meaningless.{''}
   Methods: A large database of monoamine transporter response to amino
   acid precursor administration variations with clinical outcomes was
   accumulated. In the process, a new organic cation transporter (OCT)
   model has been published, and OCT functional status determination along
   with amino acid precursor manipulation methods have been invented and
   refined.
   Results: Methodology was developed whereby manipulation of the OCT, in
   the competitive inhibition state, is carried out in a predictable
   manner. This, in turn, has disproved the long-held assertion that the
   monoamine competitive inhibition state is functionally meaningless.
   Conclusion: The most significant aspect of this paper is the
   documentation of newly recognized relationships between serotonin and
   dopamine. When transport of serotonin and dopamine are both in the
   competitive inhibition state, manipulation of the concentrations of one
   will lead to predictable changes in concentrations of the other. From a
   functional standpoint, processes regulated and controlled by changes to
   only serotonin can now be controlled by changes to dopamine, and vice
   versa, in a predictable manner.},

Abstract = {Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) often results in cellular oxidative stress
   and the subsequent apoptosis of cardiac microvascular endothelial cells
   (CMECs). More recently, studies have highlighted the therapeutic effects
   of matrine on various cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the aim of the
   present study was to investigate the underlying mechanism and effects of
   matrine on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced apoptosis of CMECs in
   rats. CMECs from Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were primarily treated with
   H/R, ld (low-dose, 0.5 mg/mL)-Ma + H/R, and (middle-dose, 1 mg/mL)-Ma +
   H/R, hd (high-dose, 2 mg/mL)-Ma + H/R, Ma + AG490 + H/R (2 mg/mL matrine
   and 50 mu mol/L AG490, a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway inhibitor), and
   AG490 + H/R in an attempt to identify the underlying regulatory
   mechanisms of matrine. MTT assay was applied to determine cell
   viability. Hoechst staining was performed to detect the morphology of
   apoptotic CMECs, while cell cycle and the rate of apoptosis rate were
   determined by flow cytometry means. The mRNA and protein expression of
   the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and apoptosis related genes were
   determined through the use of RT-qPCR and western blot assay methods
   respectively. An in vitro angiogenesis assay was employed to evaluate
   the value of matrine in tube formation. CMECs treated with ld-Ma + H/R,
   md-Ma + H/R, hd-Ma + H/R and Ma + AG490 + H/R exhibited higher cell
   viability, greater cell ratio at the S phase, higher expression levels
   of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, increased tube formation ability, and a lower
   apoptosis rate, with a lower ratio of cells at the G1 phase and
   Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, the rats treated with AG490 + H/R exhibited
   opposite results. Taken together, the key findings of the present study
   suggest that matrine inhibits the H/R-induced apoptosis of CMECs in rats
   via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, highlighting its therapeutic
   potential for H/R injury.},

Abstract = {A tissue-engineered oesophageal scaffold could be very useful for the
   treatment of pediatric and adult patients with benign or malignant
   diseases such as carcinomas, trauma or congenital malformations. Here we
   decellularize rat oesophagi inside a perfusion bioreactor to create
   biocompatible biological rat scaffolds that mimic native architecture,
   resist mechanical stress and induce angiogenesis. Seeded allogeneic
   mesenchymal stromal cells spontaneously differentiate (proven by gene-,
   protein and functional evaluations) into epithelial-and muscle-like
   cells. The reseeded scaffolds are used to orthotopically replace the
   entire cervical oesophagus in immunocompetent rats. All animals survive
   the 14-day study period, with patent and functional grafts, and gain
   significantly more weight than sham-operated animals. Explanted grafts
   show regeneration of all the major cell and tissue components of the
   oesophagus including functional epithelium, muscle fibres, nerves and
   vasculature. We consider the presented tissue-engineered oesophageal
   scaffolds a significant step towards the clinical application of
   bioengineered oesophagi.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people
   with cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a
   potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)
   inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical
   context.
   METHODS
   Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and
   North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease
   and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with
   Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15,
   2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry
   as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of
   March 28, 2020.
   RESULTS
   Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was
   available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the
   hospital (5.8\%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to
   be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death
   were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0\%, vs. 4.9\% among
   those <= 65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2\%, vs. 5.2\% among
   those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95\% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart
   failure (15.3\%, vs. 5.6\% among those without heart failure; odds
   ratio, 2.48; 95\% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5\%, vs.
   5.6\% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95\% CI, 1.33 to
   2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2\%, vs. 5.6\% among
   those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95\% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and
   current smoking (9.4\%, vs. 5.6\% among former smokers or nonsmokers;
   odds ratio, 1.79; 95\% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of
   in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE
   inhibitors (2.1\% vs. 6.1\%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or
   the use of ARBs (6.8\% vs. 5.7\%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.87 to
   1.74).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying
   cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of
   in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results
   did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful
   association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this
   clinical context.},

Abstract = {Mutation of tub gene in mice induces obesity, suggesting that tub could
   be an important regulator of energy balance. In the current study, we
   investigated whether insulin, leptin, and obesity can modulate Tub in
   vivo in hypothalamic nuclei, and we investigated possible consequences
   on energy balance, neuropeptide expression, and hepatic glucose
   metabolism. Food intake, metabolic characteristics, signaling proteins,
   and neuropeptide expression were measured in response to fasting and
   refeeding, intracerebroventricular insulin and leptin, and Tub antisense
   oligonucleotide (ASO). Tub tyrosine phosphorylation (Tub-p-tyr) is
   modulated by nutritional status. Tub is a substrate of insulin receptor
   tyrosine kinase (IRTK) and leptin receptor (LEPR)-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)
   in hypothalamic nuclei. After leptin or insulin stimulation, Tub
   translocates to the nucleus. Inhibition of Tub expression in
   hypothalamus by ASO increased food intake, fasting blood glucose, and
   hepatic glucose output, decreased O-2 consumption, and blunted the
   effect of insulin or leptin on proopiomelanocortin, thyroid-releasing
   hormone, melanin-concentrating hormone, and orexin expression. In
   hypothalamus of mice administered a high-fat diet, there is a reduction
   in leptin and insulin-induced Tub-p-tyr and nuclear translocation, which
   is reversed by reducing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B expression.
   These results indicate that Tub has a key role in the control of insulin
   and leptin effects on food intake, and the modulation of Tub may
   contribute to insulin and leptin resistance in DIO mice. Diabetes

Abstract = {Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the elderly, but whether
   this is the result of a primary aging myopathy dictated by depletion of
   the cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) pool is unknown. Similarly, whether
   current lifespan reflects the ineluctable genetic clock or heart failure
   interferes with the genetically determined fate of the organ and
   organism is an important question. We have identified that chronological
   age leads to telomeric shortening in CPCs, which by necessity generate a
   differentiated progeny that rapidly acquires the senescent phenotype
   conditioning organ aging. CPC aging is mediated by attenuation of the
   insulin-like growth factor-1/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and
   hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met systems, which do not counteract any
   longer the CPC renin-angiotensin system, resulting in cellular
   senescence, growth arrest, and apoptosis. However, pulse-chase
   5-bromodeoxyuridine-labeling assay revealed that the senescent heart
   contains functionally competent CPCs that have the properties of stem
   cells. This subset of telomerase-competent CPCs have long telomeres and,
   following activation, migrate to the regions of damage, where they
   generate a population of young cardiomyocytes, reversing partly the
   aging myopathy. The senescent heart phenotype and heart failure are
   corrected to some extent, leading to prolongation of maximum lifespan.},

Abstract = {Microseismic methods are crucial for real-time monitoring of the
   hydraulic fracturing dynamic status during the development of
   unconventional reservoirs. However, unlike the active-source seismic
   events, the microseismic events usually have low signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR), which makes its data processing challenging. To overcome the
   noise issue of the weak microseismic events, we propose a new workflow
   for high-resolution microseismic event detection. For the preprocessing,
   fix-sized segmentation with a length of 2{*}wavelength is used to divide
   the data into segments. Later on, 191 features have been extracted and
   used as the input data to train the support vector machine (SVM) model.
   These features include 63 1-D time/spectral-domain features, and 128 2-D
   texture features, which indicate the continuity, smoothness, and
   irregularity of the events/noise. The proposed feature extraction
   maximally exploits the limited information of each segment. Afterward,
   we use a combination of univariate feature selection and
   random-forest-based recursive feature elimination for feature selection
   to avoid overfitting. This feature selection strategy not only finds the
   best features, but also decides the optimal number of features that are
   needed for the best accuracy. Regarding the training process, SVM with a
   Gaussian kernel is used. In addition, a cross-validation (CV) process is
   implemented for automatic parameter setting. In the end, a group of
   synthetic and field microseismic data with different levels of
   complexity show that the proposed workflow is much more robust than the
   state-of-the-art short-term-average over long-term-average ratio
   (STA/LTA) method and also performs better than the
   convolutional-neural-networks (CNN), for this case where the amount of
   training data sets is limited. A demo for the synthetic example is
   available: https://github.com/shanqu91/ML event detection microseismic.},

Abstract = {Dexamethasone has antiemetic and analgesic effects in various types of
   surgery. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we
   evaluated the efficacy of dexamethasone for reducing postoperative
   nausea and vomiting (PONV) and analgesic requirement in women undergoing
   general anesthesia for mastectomy. Patient were allocated randomly to
   one of three groups (n = 30 of each) to receive intravenously either
   placebo or dexamethasone at two different doses (4 mg, 8 mg) at the end
   of surgery. Postoperatively, emetic episodes and analgesic requirement
   were evaluated by an investigator. Patient demographics and types of
   surgery were not different among the treatment groups. The rate of
   patients experiencing PONV during 024 hours after anesthesia was 33\%
   with dexamethasone 4 mg (p = 0.01) and 27\% with dexamethasone 8 mg (p =
   0.002), compared with placebo (67\%). The need of indomethacin for
   intolerable pain was less in patients who had received dexamethasone 8
   mg than in those who had received placebo (p = 0.001) or dexamethasone 4
   mg (p = 0.034). No difference in analgesic requirement was found between
   the dexamethasone 4 mg and placebo groups (p = 0.18). No clinically
   serious adverse events attributed to the study drug were observed in any
   of the groups. We conclude that dexamethasone 8 mg effectively decreases
   PONV and analgesic requirement in women undergoing general anesthesia
   for mastectomy.},

Abstract = {Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP) may be present in food packaging,
   which would put consumers at risk of NP ingestion. There is little
   information on the amount of ZnO NP that are present in food packaging
   and the effects of ZnO exposure on intestinal function. To estimate
   physiologically relevant ZnO exposures, foods that are naturally low in
   zinc (Zn), but are commonly packaged with ZnO NP, such as tuna, corn,
   and asparagus, were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS). It was found that the Zn present in a serving of
   these foods is approximately one hundred times higher than the
   recommended dietary allowance. An in vitro model of the small intestine
   composed of Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells was used to investigate the
   effects of ZnO NP exposure. Cells were exposed to physiologically
   realistic doses of pristine NP in culture medium and to NP subjected to
   an in vitro digestion to better reflect the transformation that the NP
   may undergo once they enter the human GI tract. Uptake and/or transport
   of iron (Fe), Zn, glucose, and fatty acids were assessed and intestinal
   alkaline phosphatase (IAP) levels were measured before and after NP
   exposure. The findings show that there is a 75\% decrease in Fe
   transport and a 30\% decrease in glucose transport following ZnO NP
   exposure. These decreases were consistent with gene expression changes
   for their transporters. There is also evidence that the ZnO NP affect
   the microvilli of the intestinal cells, therefore reducing the amount of
   surface area available to absorb nutrients. These results suggest that
   the ingestion of physiologically relevant doses of ZnO NP can alter
   intestinal function in an in vitro model of the human small intestine.},

   Although some marine organisms have been shown to ingest plastic, few

   inhibits hatching, decreases growth rates, and alters feeding
   preferences and innate behaviors of European perch (Perca fluviatilis)

   to olfactory threat cues, which greatly increases predator-induced
   mortality rates. Our results demonstrate that microplastic particles
   operate both chemically and physically on larval fish performance and

Abstract = {Amplitude-preserving data processing is an important and challenging
   topic in many scientific fields. The amplitude-variation details in
   seismic data are especially important because the amplitude variation is
   directly related with the subsurface wave impedance and fluid
   characteristics. We propose a novel seismic noise attenuation approach
   that is based on local plane-wave assumption of seismic events and the
   amplitude preserving capability of the orthogonal polynomial transform
   (OPT). The OPT is a way for representing spatially correlative seismic
   data as a superposition of polynomial basis functions, by which the
   random noise is distinguished from the useful energy by the high
   orthogonal polynomial coefficients. The seismic energy is the most
   correlative along the structural direction and thus the OPT is optimally
   performed in a flattened gather. We introduce in detail the flattening
   operator for creating the flattened dimension, where the OPT can be
   applied subsequently. The flattening operator is created by deriving a
   plane-wave trace continuation relation following the plane-wave
   equation. We demonstrate that both plane-wave trace continuation and OPT
   can well preserve the strong amplitude variation existing in seismic
   data. In order to obtain a robust slope estimation performance in the
   presence of noise, a robust slope estimation approach is introduced to
   substitute the traditional method. A group of synthetic, pre-stack and
   post-stack field seismic data are used to demonstrate the potential of
   the proposed framework in realistic applications.},

Abstract = {Background: The present study investigated the effects of microvascular

   of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) ex vivo. Methods and
   Results: MECs were collected from the lung tissue of C57BL/6 mice, and
   HSCs were isolated with immunomagnetic beads from bone marrow of GFP
   mice. MECs and HSCs were co-cultured with or without having direct
   cell-cell contact in Transwell device for the measurement of chemotaxis
   and adhesion of MECs to HSCs. Experimental results indicate that the
   penetration rate of HSCs from the Transwell upper chamber to lower
   chamber in `co-culture' group was significantly higher than that of `HSC
   single culture' group. Also, the HSCs in co-culture group were all
   adherent at 24 h, and the co-culture group with direct cell-cell contact
   had highest proliferation rate. The HSC number was positively correlated
   with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal cell-derived
   factor-1 (SDF-1) levels in supernatants of the culture. Conclusions: Our
   study reports that MECs enhance the chemotaxis, adhesion and
   proliferation of HSCs, which might be related to cytokines SDF-1 and
   VEGF secreted by MECs, and thus MECs enhance the HSC proliferation
   through cell-cell contact. The present study revealed the effect of MECs
   on HSCs, and provided a basis and direction for effective expansion of
   HSCs ex vivo.},

Abstract = {The K-SVD algorithm has been successfully utilized for adaptively
   learning the sparse dictionary in 2-D seismic denoising. Because of the
   high computational cost of many singular value decompositions (SVDs) in
   the K-SVD algorithm, it is not applicable in practical situations,
   especially in 3-D or 5-D problems. In this paper, I extend the
   dictionary learning based denoising approach from 2-D to 3-D. To address
   the computational efficiency problem in K-SVD, I propose a fast
   dictionary learning approach based on the sequential generalized K-means
   (SGK) algorithm for denoising multidimensional seismic data. The SGK
   algorithm updates each dictionary atom by taking an arithmetic average
   of several training signals instead of calculating an SVD as used in
   K-SVD algorithm. I summarize the sparse dictionary learning algorithm
   using K-SVD, and introduce SGK algorithm together with its detailed
   mathematical implications. 3-D synthetic, 2-D and 3-D field data
   examples are used to demonstrate the performance of both K-SVD and SGK
   algorithms. It has been shown that SGK algorithm can significantly
   increase the computational efficiency while only slightly degrading the
   denoising performance.},

Abstract = {Volcanoes along the Syrian rift, which extend a distance of about 1000
   km, brought to the surface mantle xenoliths within erupted basalts,
   during multiples periods of volcanic activity. Xenoliths in early
   Cretaceous volcanoes originate in the garnet peridotite field of the
   subcontinental mantle, whereas those in recent Cenozoic volcanoes, the
   prime object of this study, are issued from shallower levels (spinel
   peridotite field). The recent discovery of sapphirine-bearing websterite
   in Tel Thanoun, a small volcanic diatreme inside the larger Quaternary
   volcanic field (Djebel Al Arab), allows us to estimate the P-T evolution
   and fluid rock interaction at the volcanic source. Harzburgites and
   Iherzolites are equilibrated at a temperature of about 1000 degrees C at
   a depth of 35-40 km. Sapphirine appears to have formed during cooling,
   at depth at a temperature of about 900 degrees C, at a time where spinel
   exsolution occurred in harzburgite and lherzolite pyroxenes. This
   occurred in the presence of a high-density pure CO2 fluid phase, still
   present in primary fluid inclusions. The highly-aluminous
   sapphirine-bearing protolith might be former garnet websterite (possibly
   uplifted during cretaceous magmatism), which resided and cooled in the
   spinet peridotite stability field, and was then dragged and brought to
   the surface by quaternary basalts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Schwann cells produce myelin sheath around peripheral nerve axons.
   Myelination is critical for rapid propagation of action potentials, as
   illustrated by the large number of acquired and hereditary peripheral
   neuropathies, such as diabetic neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth
   diseases, that are commonly associated with a process of demyelination.
   However, the early molecular events that trigger the demyelination
   program in these diseases remain unknown. Here, we used virally
   delivered fluorescent probes and in vivo time-lapse imaging in a mouse
   model of demyelination to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the
   demyelination process. We demonstrated that mitochondria! calcium
   released by voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) after sciatic
   nerve injury triggers Schwann cell demyelination via ERK1/2, p38, JNK,
   and c-JUN activation. In diabetic mice, VDAC1 activity was altered,
   resulting in a mitochondria! calcium leak in Schwann cell cytoplasm,
   thereby priming the cell for demyelination. Moreover, reduction of
   mitochondria! calcium release, either by shRNA-mediated VDAC1 silencing
   or pharmacological inhibition, prevented demyelination, leading to nerve
   conduction and neuromuscular performance recovery in rodent models of
   diabetic neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Therefore, this
   study identifies mitochondria as the early key factor in the molecular
   mechanism of peripheral demyelination and opens a potential opportunity
   for the treatment of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies.},

Abstract = {Aldosterone, as a major product of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
   (RAAS), determines multiple pathophysiological processes in
   cardiovascular diseases. The excess inflammatory response is one of the
   key profiles in aldosterone-mediated cardiac remodeling. However, the
   potential mechanisms of aldosterone/inflammatory signaling were still
   not fully disclosed. The present study aimed to investigate whether
   TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (Trif)
   participated in the aldosterone-induced cardiac remodeling, and to
   explore potential molecular mechanisms. Trif knockout mice and their
   littermates were osmotically administrated with aldosterone (50 mu g/kg
   per day) for 21 and 42 days. The cardiac structural analysis, functional
   parameters, and mitochondrial function were measured. Aldosterone dose-
   or time-dependently increased the levels of TRIF in primary mouse
   cardiomyocytes or mouse heart tissues. Trif deficiency protected against
   aldosterone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and dysfunction.
   Moreover, Trif deficiency also suppressed aldosterone-induced cardiac
   inflammatory response and mitochondrial injuries. Mechanistically,
   overexpression of cardiac microRNAs (miR)-34a reversed the cardiac
   benefits of Trif deficiency in aldosterone-treated mice. Taken together,
   Trif/miR-34a axis could provide a novel molecular mechanism for
   explaining aldosterone-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and
   functional disorders.},

Title = {A Scoping Review of Species Distribution Modeling Methods for Tick
   Vectors},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Background: Globally, tick-borne disease is a pervasive and worsening
   problem that impacts human and domestic animal health, livelihoods, and
   numerous economies. Species distribution models are useful tools to help
   address these issues, but many different modeling approaches and
   environmental data sources exist. Objective: We conducted a scoping
   review that examined all available research employing species
   distribution models to predict occurrence and map tick species to
   understand the diversity of model strategies, environmental predictors,
   tick data sources, frequency of climate projects of tick ranges, and
   types of model validation methods. Design: Following the PRISMA-ScR
   checklist, we searched scientific databases for eligible articles, their
   references, and explored related publications through a graphical tool
   (). Two independent reviewers performed article selection and
   characterization using a priori criteria. Results: We describe data
   collected from 107 peer-reviewed articles that met our inclusion
   criteria. The literature reflects that tick species distributions have
   been modeled predominantly in North America and Europe and have mostly
   modeled the habitat suitability for Ixodes ricinus (n = 23; 21.5\%). A
   wide range of bioclimatic databases and other environmental correlates
   were utilized among models, but the WorldClim database and its
   bioclimatic variables 1-19 appeared in 60 (56\%) papers. The most
   frequently chosen modeling approach was MaxEnt, which also appeared in
   60 (56\%) of papers. Despite the importance of ensemble modeling to
   reduce bias, only 23 papers (21.5\%) employed more than one algorithm,
   and just six (5.6\%) used an ensemble approach that incorporated at
   least five different modeling methods for comparison. Area under the
   curve/receiver operating characteristic was the most frequently reported
   model validation method, utilized in nearly all (98.9\%) included
   studies. Only 21\% of papers used future climate scenarios to predict
   tick range expansion or contraction. Regardless of the representative
   concentration pathway, six of seven genera were expected to both expand
   and retract depending on location, while Ornithodoros was predicted to
   only expand beyond its current range. Conclusion: Species distribution
   modeling techniques are useful and widely employed tools for predicting
   tick habitat suitability and range movement. However, the vast array of
   methods, data sources, and validation strategies within the SDM
   literature support the need for standardized protocols for species
   distribution and ecological niche modeling for tick vectors.},

Abstract = {Mitochondria are the particular target of arsenic (As) in the cell. Cell
   death induced by As is associated with mitochondrial membrane
   depolarization and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. DATS
   is a lipophilic organosulfur compound found in garlic, which is known
   for its potent biological and pharmacological effects. Hence, this study
   was aimed to investigate the protective role of diallyl trisulphide
   against As induced oxidative stress in cardiac mitochondria.
   Mitochondria were isolated from the heart tissue of rats from all the
   groups and used for this present study. The exposed rats showed
   significant increases in lipid peroxidation products, mitochondrial
   swelling, NO concentration, H2O2 production, the concentration of
   arsenic in cardiac tissue and mitochondria, and alterations in the lipid
   profile of mitochondria. Significant decreases in mitochondrial
   antioxidant and Krebs cycle enzymes, cytochrome-c-oxidase, ATP, Ca2+
   level, oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial membrane potential were
   observed in the heart mitochondria of As exposed rats. All these changes
   caused by As could be lessened by the pre-supplementation of diallyl
   trisulphide. The protective effect of DATS on the heart mitochondria was
   evidenced by altering all the changes induced by As and it is supported
   by TEM results. All these activities of DATS may be responsible for the
   defensive action of DATS against As induced mitochondrial damage in the

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of long-term post-retraction citation
   to falsified clinical trial data (Matsuyama et al. in Chest
   128(6):3817-3827, 2005. 10.1378/chest.128.6.3817), demonstrating
   problems with how the current digital library environment communicates
   retraction status. Eleven years after its retraction, the paper
   continues to be cited positively and uncritically to support a medical
   nutrition intervention, without mention of its 2008 retraction for
   falsifying data. To date no high quality clinical trials reporting on
   the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing inflammatory markers
   have been published. Our paper uses network analysis, citation context
   analysis, and retraction status visibility analysis to illustrate the
   potential for extended propagation of misinformation over a citation
   network, updating and extending a case study of the first 6 years of
   post-retraction citation (Fulton et al. in Publications 3(1):7-26, 2015.
   10.3390/publications3010017). The current study covers 148 direct
   citations from 2006 through 2019 and their 2542 second-generation
   citations and assesses retraction status visibility of the case study
   paper and its retraction notice on 12 digital platforms as of 2020. The
   retraction is not mentioned in 96\% (107/112) of direct post-retraction
   citations for which we were able to conduct citation context analysis.
   Over 41\% (44/107) of direct post-retraction citations that do not
   mention the retraction describe the case study paper in detail, giving a
   risk of diffusing misinformation from the case paper. We analyze 152
   second-generation citations to the most recent 35 direct citations
   (2010-2019) that do not mention the retraction but do mention methods or
   results of the case paper, finding 23 possible diffusions of
   misinformation from these non-direct citations to the case paper. Link
   resolving errors from databases show a significant challenge in a reader
   reaching the retraction notice via a database search. Only 1/8 databases
   (and 1/9 database records) consistently resolved the retraction notice
   to its full-text correctly in our tests. Although limited to evaluation
   of a single case (N = 1), this work demonstrates how retracted research
   can continue to spread and how the current information environment
   contributes to this problem.},

Abstract = {Exercise enhances bone growth and increases peak bone mass. The aim of
   this study was to determine whether or not 4 weeks of deconditioning
   after 8 weeks of exercise in growing rats would result in a decrease in
   bone gain or reverse the benefits of exercise. Fifty 4-week-old female
   Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized by a stratified weight method into 5
   groups with 10 rats in each group: 8 weeks exercise (8EX), 8 weeks
   sedentary control (8S), 12 weeks exercise (12EX), 8 weeks exercise
   followed by 4 weeks sedentary (8EX4S), and 12 weeks sedentary control
   (12S). The exercise consisted of running on a treadmill with a 5 degrees
   slope at 24 m/minute for 1 h/day and 5 days/week. After each period of
   exercise, cancellous and cortical bone histomorphometry were performed
   on double fluorescent labeled 5-mu m-thick sections of the proximal
   tibia and 40-mu m-thick sections of the tibial shaft, respectively.
   Eight and 12 weeks of exercise resulted in a significant increase in the
   body weight and gastrocnemius muscle weight by two-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA). The femoral wet weight (mg; mean +/- SD; 8EX, 781 +/-
   45.1 vs. 8S, 713 +/- 40.5; p < 0.05; 12EX, 892 +/- 41.6 vs. 12S, 807 +/-
   19.8; p < 0.05) was significantly higher in the exercise group than that
   in the respective control groups. The femoral wet weight and bone volume
   (BV) of the 8EX4S group (818 +/- 46.2 mg and 531 +/- 31.2 mu l,
   respectively) were significantly lower than those of the 12EX group (p <
   0.05) and did not differ significantly from those of the 12S groups. The
   cancellous BV was significantly higher in the 8EX and 12EX groups than
   that in the respective sedentary groups (p < 0.05). The cortical bone
   area of the tibial shaft was also significantly higher in the 12EX than
   that in the 12S group (p < 0.05). The increase in the cancellous BV or
   cortical bone area was caused by an increase in the mineral apposition
   rate (MAR), without a significant effect in the labeled perimeter. The
   bone formation rate (BFR; mu m(3)/mu m(2) per day) in the cancellous
   bone (12EX, 27.9 +/- 7.74 vs. 12S, 15.4 +/- 4.56; p < 0.05) or
   periosteal surface (12EX, 127.6 +/- 27.7 vs. 12S, 79.5 +/- 18.6; p <
   0.05) was significantly higher in the exercised groups than that in the
   respective control group (p < 0.05). Again, deconditioning resulted in a
   decrease in the cancellous BFR, BV, periosteal BFR, and cortical bone
   area to levels not significantly different from the 12S group. In
   conclusion our findings showed that exercised growing rats, when
   deconditioned, lost the benefits gained through exercise and their bone
   parameters were reduced to levels not different from the sedentary
   control. Thus, continued exercise is required to maintain high bone
   mass.},

Title = {Liquid Biopsy as Surrogate to Tissue in Lung Cancer for Molecular
   Profiling: A Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {CURRENT RESPIRATORY MEDICINE REVIEWS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-60},
Abstract = {Background: The accurate microscopic diagnosis of lung cancer has become
   insufficient due to the concept of personalized medicine. Tissue samples
   are used not only for microscopic diagnosis but also for the assessment
   of the different targets. Biopsies are performed in 80\% of the patients
   and they are not sufficient for molecular diagnosis in 30 \% of the
   cases. Liquid biopsy (LB) has been reported as a possible surrogate to
   tissue samples and has been introduced in the management scheme of the
   patients since 2014. We aimed to highlight the diagnostic value of
   liquid biopsy in assessing the molecular profile of non small cell
   carcinomas in comparison with tissue biopsy.
   Methods: We retracted eligible articles from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane
   databases. We calculated the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity
   (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR)
   and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). A summary receiver operating
   characteristic curve (SROC) and area under curve (AUC) were used to
   evaluate the overall diagnostic performance using the Meta-Disc software
   5.1.32. The heterogeneity was assessed using I square statistics. A
   meta-regression was performed in case of heterogeneity. In case of
   absence of covariates, a sensitivity analysis was done in order to
   assess publications that induced a statistical bias.
   Results: 39 eligible studies involving 4782 patients were included. The
   overall statistical studies showed heterogeneity in the SEN, SPE, PLR,
   NLR and DOR. No threshold effect was revealed. The meta-regression
   incorporating the ethnicity, the test, the technique used in tissue and
   plasma and the use of plasma or serum as covariates showed no impact of
   these factors. A sensitivity analysis allowed achieving the homogeneity
   in the SPE and DOR. The overall pooled SEN and SPE were 0.61 and 0.95
   respectively. The PLR was 9.51, the NLR was 0.45 and DOR was 24.58. The
   SROC curve with AUC of 0,93 indicated that the liquid biopsy is capable
   of identifying wild type samples from mutated ones with a relatively
   high accuracy.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggested that detection of molecular
   mutations by cfDNA is of adequate diagnostic accuracy in association to
   tissues. The high specificity and the moderate sensitivity highlight the
   value of LB as a screening test.},

Abstract = {Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal
   malignancies. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) DANCR is a newly identified
   oncogenic lncRNA. However, the functional role and underlying molecular
   mechanisms of DANCR involved in GC progress remain unclear. In the
   present study, we investigated the biological function and underlying
   mechanisms of DANCR in GC cell migration and invasion. The results
   showed that knockdown of DANCR inhibited migration and invasion of GC
   cells, whereas overexpression of DANCR showed the opposite effect.
   Further investigation demonstrated that lncRNA-LET was a bona fide
   target gene of DANCR. In addition, high DANCR and low lncRNA-LET were
   significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis and late clinical
   stage. DANCR associated with EZH2 and HDAC3 to epigenetically silence
   lncRNA-LET and then regulated GC migration and invasion. Taken together,
   these findings indicate an important role for DANCR-lncRNA-LET axis in
   GC cell migration and invasion, and reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism
   for lncRNA-LET silencing.},

Abstract = {Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a major cause of acute liver failure
   and serves as a paradigm to elucidate mechanisms, predisposing factors
   and therapeutic interventions. The roles of apoptosis and inflammation
   during APAP hepatotoxicity remain controversial. We investigated whether
   fasting of mice for 24 h can inhibit APAP-induced caspase activation and
   apoptosis through the depletion of basal ATP We also investigated in
   fasted mice the critical role played by inhibition of caspase-dependent
   cysteine 106 oxidation within high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1)
   released by ATP depletion in dying cells as a mechanism of immune
   activation. In fed mice treated with APAP necrosis was the dominant form
   of hepatocyte death. However, apoptosis was also observed, indicated by
   K18 cleavage, DNA laddering and procaspase-3 processing. In fasted mice
   treated with APAP only necrosis was observed. Inflammatory cell
   recruitment as a consequence of hepatocyte death was observed only in
   fasted mice treated with APAP or fed mice cotreated with a caspase
   inhibitor. Hepatic inflammation was also associated with loss in
   detection of serum oxidized-HMGB1. A significant role of HMGB1 in the
   induction of inflammation was confirmed with an HMGB1-neutralizing
   antibody. The differential response between fasted and fed mice was a
   consequence of a significant reduction in basal hepatic AIR which
   prevented caspase processing, rather than glutathione depletion or
   altered APAP metabolism. Thus, the inhibition of caspase-driven
   apoptosis and HMGB1 oxidation by ATP depletion from fasting promotes an
   inflammatory response during drug-induced hepatotoxicity/liver

Abstract = {Flagellar beating drives sperm through the female reproductive tract and
   is vital for reproduction. Flagellar waves are generated by thousands of
   asymmetric molecular components; yet, paradoxically, forward swimming
   arises via symmetric side-to-side flagellar movement. This led to the
   preponderance of symmetric flagellar control hypotheses. However,
   molecular asymmetries must still dictate the flagellum and be manifested
   in the beat. Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations,
   reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses
   asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed
   three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal
   controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a
   pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides.
   Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical
   illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the
   sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically
   regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim
   forward.},

Title = {RETRACTED: High Systemic Levels of the Cytokine-Inducing HMGB1 Isoform

Abstract = {Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a potentially fatal complication
   of systemic inflammation. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear
   protein extensively leaked extracellularly during necrotic cell death or
   actively secreted by natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and
   additional cells during infection or sterile injury. Extracellular HMGB1
   orchestrates key events in inflammation as a prototypic alarmin. The
   redox states of its three cysteines render the molecule mutually
   exclusive functions: fully reduced ``all-thiol HMGB1{''} exerts
   chemotactic activity; ``disulfide HMGB1{''} has cytokine-inducing,
   toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated effects-while terminally oxidized
   ``sulfonyl HMGB1{''} lacks inflammatory activity. This study examines
   the kinetic pattern of systemic HMGB1 isoform expression during therapy
   in four children with severe MAS. Three of the four patients with
   underlying systemic rheumatic diseases were treated with biologics and
   two suffered from triggering herpes virus infections at the onset of
   MAS. All patients required intensive care unit therapy due to
   life-threatening illness. Tandem mass-spectrometric analysis revealed
   dramatically increased systemic levels of the cytokine-inducing HMGB1
   isoform during early MAS. Disease control coincided with supplementary
   etoposide therapy initiated to boost apoptotic cell death, when systemic
   HMGB1 levels drastically declined and the molecule emerged mainly in its
   oxidized, noninflammatory isoform. Systemic interferon (IFN)-gamma and
   ferritin peaked concomitantly with HMGB1, whereas interleukin (IL)-18
   and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 levels developed differently.
   In conclusion, this work provides new insights in HMGB1 biology,
   suggesting that the molecule is not merely a biomarker of inflammation,
   but most likely also contributes to the pathogenesis of MAS. These
   observations encourage further studies of disulfide HMGB1 antagonists to
   improve outcome of MAS.},

Abstract = {Microseismic data are usually of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which
   makes it difficult to utilize the microseismic waveforms for imaging and
   inversion. We develop a useful denoising algorithm based on a
   non-stationary least-squares decomposition model to enhance the quality
   of microseismic signals. The microseismic signals are assumed to be
   represented by a superposition of several smoothly variable components.
   We construct a least-squares inverse problem to solve for the the smooth
   components. We constrain the least-squares inversion via both time and
   space constraints. The temporal smoothness constraint is applied to
   ensure the stability when calculating the non-stationary autoregression
   coefficients. The space-smoothness constraint is applied to extract the
   spatial correlation among multichannel microseismic traces. The new
   algorithm is validated via several synthetic and real microseismic data
   and are proved to be effective. Comparison with the state-of-the-art
   algorithms demonstrates that the proposed method is more powerful in
   suppressing random noise of a wide range of levels than its competing
   methods.},

Abstract = {Rationale: According to the immortal DNA strand hypothesis, dividing
   stem cells selectively segregate chromosomes carrying the old template
   DNA, opposing accumulation of mutations resulting from nonrepaired
   replication errors and attenuating telomere shortening.
   Objective: Based on the premise of the immortal DNA strand hypothesis,
   we propose that stem cells retaining the old DNA would represent the
   most powerful cells for myocardial regeneration.
   Methods and Results: Division of human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) by
   nonrandom and random segregation of chromatids was documented by clonal
   assay of bromodeoxyuridine-tagged hCSCs. Additionally, their growth
   properties were determined by a series of in vitro and in vivo studies.
   We report that a small class of hCSCs retain during replication the
   mother DNA and generate 2 daughter cells, which carry the old and new
   DNA, respectively. hCSCs with immortal DNA form a pool of nonsenescent
   cells with longer telomeres and higher proliferative capacity. The
   self-renewal and long-term repopulating ability of these cells was shown
   in serial-transplantation assays in the infarcted heart; these cells
   created a chimeric organ, composed of spared rat and regenerated human
   cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels, leading to a remarkable restoration
   of cardiac structure and function. The documentation that hCSCs divide
   by asymmetrical and symmetrical chromatid segregation supports the view
   that the human heart is a self-renewing organ regulated by a compartment
   of resident hCSCs.
   Conclusions: The impressive recovery in ventricular hemodynamics and
   anatomy mediated by clonal hCSCs carrying the ``mother{''} DNA
   underscores the clinical relevance of this stem cell class for the
   management of heart failure in humans. (Circ Res. 2012;111:894-906.)},

Abstract = {Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents the most commonly
   occurring inflammatory type of arthritis and is a major cause of
   disability. Reports have placed emphasis on the potential of, granzyme B
   (GZMB) as a potentially valuable prognostic marker in early RA, the
   mechanism of which still remains largely unclear. Thus, the aim of the
   current study was to investigate the effects GZMB gene silencing
   influences synovial tissue hyperplasia and articular cartilage tissue
   injury of RA through the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway.
   Methods: Following the successful establishment of the collagen-induced
   animal model of RA in rats, a five-grade scoring method was applied to
   evaluate the swelling degree measurement of the rats for model
   identification. The various rat responses to GZMB shRNA and U-46619
   (activator of the MAPK signaling pathway) were subsequently detected.
   The general status of rats was observed and recorded, with their weight
   and ankle diameter kept accurate record of. ELISA was employed to detect
   the levels of inflammatory cytokines, while RT-qPCR and Western blotting
   techniques were applied to determine the expressions of GZMB and
   pathway-related genes and proteins.
   Results: GZMB gene silencing was observed to aid in the maintenance of
   rat weight increases, while acting to reduce the degree of ankle
   swelling, while hypertrophy of the synovial tissue and the injury of the
   articular cartilage tissue were not obvious. GZMB gene silencing was
   shown to decrease inflammatory cytokine levels, as well as decreased
   bcl-2, Cyclin D1, VEGF and bFGF while increasing caspase 3. Notably,
   GZMB gene silencing suppressed the activation of the MAPK signaling
   pathway by reducing the phosphorylation extent of ERK and MEK.
   Conclusion: Taken together, the key findings of the present study
   ultimately suggest that GZMB gene silencing acts to inhibit MAPK
   signaling pathway through regulating the expressions of inflammatory
   factors, factors correlated with apoptosis (bcl-2 and caspase), as well
   as factors associated with angiogenesis (VEGF and bFGF), thus relieving
   synovial tissue hyperplasia and articular cartilage tissue injury
   brought about by RA. The GZMB gene could well be a new therapeutic
   target for RA treatment.},

Abstract = {Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine
   involved in the pathogenesis of HCV, but the sensors and underlying
   mechanisms that facilitate HCV-induced IL-1 beta proteolytic activation
   and secretion remains unclear. In this study, we have identified a
   signalling pathway leading to IL-1 beta activation and secretion in
   response to HCV infection. Previous studies have shown the induction and
   secretion of IL-1 beta through the inflammasome complex in
   macrophages/monocytes. Here, we report for the first time the induction
   and assembly of the NALP3-inflammasome complex in human hepatoma cells
   infected with HCV (JFH-1). We demonstrate that activation of IL-1 beta
   in HCV-infected cells involves the proteolytic processing of
   pro-caspase-1 into mature caspase-1 in a multiprotein inflammasome
   complex. Next, we demonstrate that HCV is sensed by NALP3 protein, which
   recruits the adaptor protein ASC for the assembly of the inflammasome
   complex. Using a small interfering RNA approach, we further show that
   components of the inflammasome complex are involved in the activation of
   IL-1 beta in HCV-infected cells. Our study also demonstrates the role of
   reactive oxygen species in HCV-induced IL-1 beta secretion.
   Collectively, these observations provide an insight into the mechanism
   of IL-1 beta processing and secretion, which is likely to provide novel
   strategies for targeting the viral or cellular determinants to arrest
   the progression of liver disease associated with chronic HCV infection.},

Abstract = {Novel mesoporous B-N-O-H nanofoam was prepared using CuB23 and ammonium
   chloride precursors under O-2 in ionic liquids via a solution plasma
   technique. It had a large specific surface area of 1023 m(2) g(-1), and
   exhibited high electrical conductivity of 20.8 S m(-1) and good specific
   capacity of 184 F g(-1) in 600 mg L-1 methylene blue aqueous solution at
   a current density of 0.2 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the nanofoam exhibited
   a high adsorption capacity for cationic dyes, especially methylene blue,
   with well-controlled recycling behavior. Meanwhile, the methylene
   blue/acid orange 7 mixture could be easily separated for reuse by the
   strong electrostatic interaction. The good separation of methylene
   blue/Rhodamine B was attributed to the stronger coordination between
   methylene blue and the B-N-O-H nanofoams in comparison with that of
   Rhodamine B, and the advantage of the smaller methylene blue in
   competitive adsorption at higher flow rates. These results indicate that
   the present B-N-O-H nanofoam may have promising applications in the
   field of water purification, including enrichment or even total
   separation of dyes during wastewater treatment for reuse.},

Abstract = {Electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate provides an avenue to reduce
   globally accelerating CO2 emissions and produce value-added products.
   Unfortunately, high selectivity in formate electrosynthesis has thus far
   only been achieved at highly cathodic potentials. Here we use density
   functional theory to investigate the effect of alloying Cu and Sn on the
   activity and selectivity towards formate. A theoretical thermodynamic
   analysis of the reaction energetics suggests that the incorporation of
   copper into tin could suppress hydrogen evolution and CO production,
   thus favouring formate generation. Consistent with theoretical trends,
   the designed CuSn3 catalysts by co-electrodeposition exhibit a Faradaic
   efficiency of 95\% towards formate generation at -0.5 V versus RHE.
   Furthermore, the catalysts show no degradation over 50 h of operation.
   In situ Sn L-3-edge and Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicate
   electron donation from Sn to Cu, which indicates positive oxidation
   states of Sn in CuSn3 under operating conditions.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To explore the sensitivity of the immunosuppressive agent
   fingolimod (FTY720) in chordoma and determine whether it can serve as an
   appropriate alternate treatment for unresectable tumours in patients
   after incomplete surgery.
   Methods: Cell viability assays, colony formation assays and EdU assays
   were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of chordoma cell lines to
   FTY720. Transwell invasion assays, wound healing assays, flow cytometry,
   cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, Western blotting
   analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed
   to evaluate cell invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
   activation of related pathways after treatment with FTY720. The effect
   of FTY720 was also evaluated in vivo in a xenograft model.
   Results: We found that FTY720 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and
   metastasis of sacral chordoma cells (P < 0.01). FTY720 also inhibited
   the proliferation of tumour cells in a xenograft model using sacral
   chordoma cell lines (P < 0.01). The mechanism was related to the EMT and
   apoptosis of chordoma cells and inactivation of lL-6/STAT3 signalling in
   vitro and in viva.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that FTY720 may be an effective
   therapeutic agent against chordoma. These findings suggest that FTY720
   is a novel agent that can treat locally advanced and metastatic
   chordoma.},

Abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that glioma stem cells (GSCs) are
   important therapeutic targets in glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we
   identified NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) as a functional binding protein
   of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) that plays a critical role in the
   posttranslational regulation of EZH2 protein in GSCs. NEK2 was among the
   most differentially expressed kinase-encoding genes in GSC-containing
   cultures (glioma spheres), and it was required for in vitro
   clonogenicity, in vivo tumor propagation, and radioresistance.
   Mechanistically, the formation of a protein complex comprising NEK2 and
   EZH2 in glioma spheres phosphorylated and then protected EZH2 from
   ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation in a NEK2 kinase
   activity-dependent manner. Clinically, NEK2 expression in patients with
   glioma was closely associated with EZH2 expression and correlated with a
   poor prognosis. NEK2 expression was also substantially elevated in
   recurrent tumors after therapeutic failure compared with primary
   untreated tumors in matched GBM patients. We designed a NEK2 kinase
   inhibitor, compound 3a (CMP3a), which efficiently attenuated GBM growth
   in a mouse model and exhibited a synergistic effect with radiotherapy.
   These data demonstrate a key role for NEK2 in maintaining GSCs in GBM by
   stabilizing the EZH2 protein and introduce the small-molecule inhibitor
   CMP3a as a potential therapeutic agent for GBM.},

   Cytokine Activity of High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB1) (Publication with

Abstract = {High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein with
   extracellular inflammatory cytokine activity. It is released passively
   during cell injury and necrosis, and secreted actively by immune cells.
   HMGB1 contains three conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues: C23
   and C45 can form an intramolecular disulfide bond, whereas C106 is
   unpaired and is essential for the interaction with Toll-Like Receptor
   (TLR) 4. However, a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic redox
   states of each cysteine residue and of their impacts on innate immune
   responses is lacking. Using tandem mass spectrometric analysis, we now
   have established that the C106 thiol and the C23-C45 disulfide bond are
   required for HMGB1 to induce nuclear NF-kappa B translocation and tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) production in macrophages. Both irreversible
   oxidation to sulphonates and complete reduction to thiols of these
   cysteines inhibited TNF production markedly. In a proof of concept
   murine model of hepatic necrosis induced by acetaminophen, during
   inflammation, the predominant form of serum HMGB1 is the active one,
   containing a C106 thiol group and a disulfide bond between C23 and C45,
   whereas the inactive form of HMGB1, containing terminally oxidized
   cysteines, accumulates during inflammation resolution and hepatic
   regeneration. These results reveal critical posttranslational redox
   mechanisms that control the proinflammatory activity of HMGB1 and its
   inactivation during pathogenesis. Online address: http://www.molmed.org

Abstract = {It is difficult to separate additive random noise from spatially
   coherent signal using a rank-reduction (RR) method that is based on the
   truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) operation. This problem is
   due to the mixture of the signal and the noise subspaces after the TSVD
   operation. This drawback can be partially conquered using a damped RR
   (DRR) method, where the singular values corresponding to effective
   signals are adjusted via a carefully designed damping operator. The
   damping operator works most powerfully in the case of a small rank and a
   small damping factor. However, for complicated seismic data, e.g.
   multichannel reflection seismic data containing highly curved events,
   the rank should be large enough to preserve the details in the data,
   which makes the DRR method less effective. In this paper, we develop an
   optimal damping strategy for adjusting the singular values when a large
   rank parameter is selected so that the estimated signal can best
   approximate the exact signal. We first weight the singular values using
   optimally calculated weights. The weights are theoretically derived by
   solving an optimization problem that minimizes the Frobenius-norm
   difference between the approximated and the exact signal components. The
   damping operator is then derived based on the initial weighting operator
   to further reduce the residual noise after the optimal weighting. The
   resulted optimally damped rank-reduction method is nearly an adaptive
   method, i.e. insensitive to the rank parameter. We demonstrate the
   performance of the proposed method on a group of synthetic and real 5-D
   seismic data.},

Abstract = {NBC Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBCn1) and NHE1 Na+/H+ exchanger have been
   associated with cardiac disorders and recently located in coronary
   endothelial cells (CEC) and cardiomyocytes mitochondria, respectively.
   Mitochondrial NHE1 blockade delays permeability transition pore (MPTP)
   opening and reduces superoxide levels, two critical events exacerbated
   in cells of diseased hearts. Conversely, activation of NBCn1 prevented
   apoptosis in CEC subjected to ischemic stress. We characterized the role
   of the NHE1 and NBCn1 transporters in heart mitochondria from
   hypertrophic (SHR) and control (Wistar) rats. Expression of NHE1 was
   analyzed in left ventricular mitochondrial lysates (LVML), by
   immunoblots. NHE1 expression increased by similar to 40\% in SHR
   compared to control (P < 0.05, n = 4). To examine NHE1-mediated Na+/H+
   exchange activity in cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondria were loaded with
   BCECF-AM dye and the maximal rate of pHm change measured after the
   addition of 50 mM NaCl. SHR mitochondria had greater changes in pHm
   compared to Wistar, 0.10 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.01, respectively (P <
   0.05, n = 5). In addition, mitochondrial suspensions from SHR and
   control myocardium were exposed to 200 mu M CaCl2 to induce MPTP opening
   (light-scattering decrease, LSD) and swelling. Surprisingly, SHR rats
   showed smaller LSD and a reduction in mitochondrial swelling, 67 +/-
   10\% (n = 15), compared to control, 100 +/- 8\% (n = 13). NBC inhibition
   with S0859 (1 mu M) significantly increased swelling in both control 139
   +/- 10\% (n = 8) and SHR 115 +/- 10\% (n = 4). Finally, NBCn1 Na+/HCO3-
   cotransporter increased by twofold its expression in SHR LVML, compared
   to normal (P < 0.05, n = 5). We conclude that increased NBCn1 activity
   may play a compensatory role in hypertrophic hearts, protecting
   mitochondria from Ca2+-induced MPTP opening and swelling.},

Abstract = {Sphingolipids make up a family of molecules associated with an array of
   biological functions, including cell death and migration. Sphingolipids
   are often altered in cancer, though how these alterations lead to tumor
   formation and progression is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed
   non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens and cell lines and
   determined that ceramide synthase 6 (CERS6) is markedly overexpressed
   compared with controls. Elevated CERS6 expression was due in part to
   reduction of microRNA-101 (miR-101) and was associated with increased
   invasion and poor prognosis. CERS6 knockdown in NSCLC cells altered the
   ceramide profile, resulting in decreased cell migration and invasion in
   vitro, and decreased the frequency of RAC1-positive lamellipodia
   formation while CERS6 overexpression promoted it. In murine models,
   CERS6 knockdown in transplanted NSCLC cells attenuated lung metastasis.
   Furthermore, combined treatment with
   L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposome and the glucosylceramide
   synthase inhibitor D-PDMP induced cell death in association with
   ceramide accumulation and promoted cancer cell apoptosis and tumor
   regression in murine models. Together, these results indicate that
   CERS6-dependent ceramide synthesis and maintenance of ceramide in the
   cellular membrane are essential for lamellipodia formation and
   metastasis. Moreover, these results suggest that targeting this
   homeostasis has potential as a therapeutic strategy for
   CERS6-overexpressing NSCLC.},

Abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) serve an important
   role in tumourigenesis and development. Although the low expression of
   miR-125a-5p in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been reported, the
   underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the current study, the low
   expression of miR-125a-5p in NSCLC was verified in paired cancer tissues
   and adjacent non-tumour tissues. Furthermore, the CpG island in the
   miR-125a-5p region was hypermethylated in the tumour tissues, and the
   hypermethylation was negatively correlated with miR-125a-5p expression.
   Target gene screening showed that the histone methyltransferase Suv39H1
   was one of the potential target genes. In vitro studies showed that
   miR-125a-5p could directly suppress Suv39H1 expression and decrease the
   H3K9me3 levels. On the other hand, Suv39H1 could induce demethylation of
   miR-125a-5p, resulting in re-activation of miR-125a-5p. What is more,
   overexpessing miR-125a-5p could also self-activate the silenced
   miR-125a-5p in NSCLC cells, which suppressed cell migration, invasion
   and proliferation in vitro and inhibited cancer progression in vivo.
   Thus, we found that the epigenetic silenced miR-125a-5p could be

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of RNA
   interference in the inhibition of MUC1 gene expression in occurrence and
   metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its in-depth
   mechanisms. The OSCC and normal oral mucosa tissues, as well as normal
   oral epithelial cell line HOK and OSCC cell line SCC-4, Cal-27, TSCCA,
   Tca8113 were obtained to detect the expression of MUC1. Slug expression
   in OSCC and normal oral mucosa tissues was also determined. The OSCC
   cells were grouped to investigate the role of MUC1 gene silencing on
   proliferation, DNA replication, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis,
   colony formation ability, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
   invasion, and migration of OSCC cells. We first found higher positive
   rate of MUC1 and Slug expression in OSCC tissues. Next, it was
   determined that higher expression of MUC1 was found in OSCC tissues and
   cells. Furthermore, silencing of MUC1 declined Slug expression,
   inhibited the proliferation, DNA replication, cell cycle progression,
   and EMT while inducing apoptosis of OSCC cells. Our study suggests that
   overexpression of MUC1 is found in OSCC, and MUC1 gene silencing could
   inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration while inducing
   apoptosis of OSCC cells.},

Abstract = {Our study was conducted to investigate whether anticancer drugs,
   cisplatin (CDDP) and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), can modulate Fas-mediated
   apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines. When OSCC
   cell lines, NA and HSC-4, were treated with CDDP and/or 5-FU, Fas and
   its mRNA expression on the plasma membrane were enhanced. An increase in
   caspase-3 and -8 activities was then observed by the addition of
   agonistic anti-Fas antibody, CH-II. Apoptosis of OSCC cells treated with
   anticancer drugs were significantly enhanced by CH-II, whereas untreated
   cells were nearly resistant to apoptosis. Moreover, the combination of
   CDDP and 5-FU resulted in an increasing susceptibility to apoptosis.
   Caspase-3 and -8 inhibitors, but not caspase-9 inhibitor, reduced
   Fas-mediated apoptosis enhanced by the anticancer drugs. Furthermore,
   OSCC cells treated with anticancer drugs exhibited decreased cellular
   FADD-like interleukin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP)
   levels, whereas neither the Fas-associated death domain-containing
   protein (FADD) nor procaspase-8 changed the expression. Moreover,
   antisense oligonucleotide to c-FLIP confirmed that down-regulation of
   c-FLIP induced sensitization to Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results
   suggest that CDDP and 5-FU may enhance the susceptibility to
   Fas-mediated apoptosis through down-regulation of c-FLIP. From these
   findings, a new potential strategy may be developed to improve the
   efficacy of anticancer drugs. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Abstract = {Objective: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to top the list
   of cancer mortaliti worldwide. Early diagnosis and therapeutic
   interventions targeting NSCLC is becoming the world's significant
   challenge. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as a group of ,
   potential cancer biomarkers.
   Materials and methods: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed
   to examine the expression of circ\_0072309 in NSCLC tissues and cell
   lines. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), wound healing and Transwell assays
   were used to analyze cell proliferation, migration and invasion in A549
   and H1299 cells. The relationship between circ\_0072309 and miR-580-3
   was analyzed by Luciferase reporter and RNA pull down assays.
   Results: We screened circ\_0072309 from Gene Expression Omnibus and
   found that circ\_0072309 was lowly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell
   lines. The transfection of circ\_0072309-overexpressing vector
   significantly suppressed the cell proliferation, migration and invasion
   in A549 and H1299 cells. We predicted that miR-580-3p is a target of
   circ\_0072309 by using publicly available bioinformatic algorithms
   Circinteractome tool and confirmed that circ\_0072309 directly bound to
   miR-580-3p. Furthermore, the addition of miR-580-3p mitigated the
   blockage of cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by
   circ\_0072309.
   Conclusions: These data showed that circ\_0072309 inhibits the
   progression of NSCLC progression via blocking the expression of
   miR-580-3p. These findings revealed the anti-tumor role of circ\_0072309
   during the development of NSCLC and provided a novel diagnostic
   biomarker and potential therapy for NSCLC.},

Abstract = {Low-frequency noise is one of the most common types of noise in seismic
   and microseismic data. Conventional approaches, such as the high-pass
   filtering method, utilize the low-frequency nature and distinguish
   between signal and noise based on their different frequency contents.
   However, conventional approaches are limited or even invalid when the
   signal and noise shares the same frequency band. Moreover, high-pass
   filtering method will suppress not only low-frequency noise but also
   low-frequency signal when they overlap in a same frequency band, which
   is extremely important in the inversion process for building the
   subsurface velocity model. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional
   high-pass filtering approach, we developed a novel method based on the
   mathematical morphology theorem to separate signal and noise using their
   differences in morphological scale. We extracted empirical relation
   between morphological scale and frequency band so that the mathematical
   morphology based approach can be conveniently used in low-frequency
   noise attenuation. The proposed method is termed as the mathematical
   morphological filtering (MMF) method. We compare the MMF approach with
   high-pass filtering and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approaches
   using synthetic, reflection seismic and microseismic examples. The
   various examples demonstrate that the proposed MMF method can preserve
   more low-frequency signal than the high-pass filtering approach, and is
   more efficient and causes fewer artefacts than the EMD approach.},

Abstract = {Objective: Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) is attributed to a lesion or
   disease of the somatosensory system, may be derived from the peripheral
   and central system. Recent study revealed that spinal cord stimulation
   attenuated CNP by inhibiting TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. The
   present study focuses on the potential analgesic effects of
   TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway on CNP in a rat model of chronic
   constriction injury (CCI).
   Methods: We successfully established the rat model of CCI by Bennett
   method, and then inhibited the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway in rat
   models. Next, we measured the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and
   thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) 0D, 2D, 6D, 8D and 12D after operation
   respectively. MTS510 100 mg/kg, an inhibitor of TLR4, was intrathecal
   injected into rats after 6D, 8D and 12D after operation. The experiment
   lasted for 12 days, and then the rats were sacrificed to collect the
   spinal cord tissues. Protein and mRNA expression levels of toll-like
   receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B), glial cell
   line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein
   (GFAP) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were detected by western blot
   analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed
   to detect GDNF, GFAP and NGF expression.
   Results: With the prolongation of MTS510 treatment time, MWT and TWL
   were increased and finally, the MWT and TWL were close to the baseline
   level. The levels of TLR4, NF-kappa B, GDNF, and GFAP as well as NGF
   increased in rats treated with CCI+ Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) or CCI +
   MTS510, suggesting the model establishment was successful. Besides, with
   the prolongation of MTS510 treatment time, the protein level and mRNA
   expression of NF-kB, GDNF, GFAP and NGF decreased in rats treated with
   CCI+ IgG1 or CCI + MTS510. Moreover, the GDNF, GFAP and NGF expression
   in spinal cord tissue in rats treated with CCI + IgG1 or CCI + MTS510
   increased obviously, while the GDNF, GFAP and NGF expression decreased
   in spinal cord tissue in rats treated with CCI + IgG1 or CCI + MTS510
   after MTS510 treatment.
   Conclusions: Collectively, this study defines the role of TLR4 and
   NF-kappa B, and inhibition of TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway might
   contribute to the alleviation of CNP and improvement of MWT and TWL in a
   rat model of CCI. Additionally, the results obtained from the study
   provided a promising basis that could aid as an experimental basis for
   the potential treatment of TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.},

Abstract = {In seismic data processing, the median filter is usually applied along
   the structural direction of seismic data in order to attenuate erratic
   or spike-like noise. The performance of a structure-oriented median
   filter highly depends on the accuracy of the estimated local slope from
   the noisy data. When local slope contains significant error, which is
   usually the case for noisy data, the structure-oriented median filter
   will still cause severe damages to useful energy. We propose a type of
   structure-oriented median filter that can effectively attenuate
   spike-like noise even when the local slope is not accurately estimated,
   which we call structure-oriented space-varying median filter. A
   structure-oriented space-varying median filter can adaptively squeeze
   and stretch the window length of the median filter when applied in the
   locally flattened dimension of an input seismic data in order to deal
   with the dipping events caused by inaccurate slope estimation. We show
   the key difference among different types of median filters in detail and
   demonstrate the principle of the structure-oriented space-varying median
   filter method. We apply the structure-oriented space-varying median
   filter method to remove the spike-like blending noise arising from the
   simultaneous source acquisition. Synthetic and real data examples show
   that structure-oriented space-varying median filter can significantly
   improve the signal preserving performance for curving events in the
   seismic data. The structure-oriented space-varying median filter can
   also be easily embedded into an iterative deblending procedure based on
   the shaping regularization framework and can help obtain much improved
   deblending performance.},

Abstract = {This article provides the first test of the decoy effect as a nudge to
   influence real-world behavior. The decoy effect is the phenomenon that
   an additional but worse option can boost the appeal of an existing
   option. It has been widely demonstrated in hypothetical choices, but its
   usefulness in real-world settings has been subject to debate. In three
   longitudinal experiments in food-processing factories, we tested two
   decoy sanitation options that were worse than the existing sanitizer
   spray bottle. Results showed that the presence of a decoy, but not an
   additional copy of the original sanitizer bottle in a different color,
   drastically increased food workers' hand sanitizer use from the original
   sanitizer bottle and, consequently, improved workers' passing rate in
   hand sanitation tests from 60\% to 70\% to above 90\% for 20 days. These
   findings indicate that the decoy effect can be a powerful nudge
   technique to influence real-world behavior.},

Abstract = {Fructose and ethanol are metabolized principally in the liver and are
   both known to contribute to the development of hepatic steatosis that
   can progress to hepatic steatohepatitis. The present study indentifies a
   synergistic interaction between fructose and ethanol in promoting
   hepatocyte sensitivity to TNF alpha-induced necroptosis. Concurrent
   exposure to fructose and ethanol induces the overexpression of the CDGSH
   iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 1 (CISD1 or mitoneet), which is
   localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. The increased expression
   of mitoneet primes the hepatocyte for TNF alpha-induced cytotoxicity.
   Treatment with TNF alpha induces the translocation of a Stat3-Grim-19
   complex to the mitochondria, which binds to mitoneet and promotes the
   rapid release of its 2Fe-2S cluster, causing an accumulation of
   mitochondrial iron. The dramatic increase of mitochondrial iron provokes
   a surge in formation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in
   mitochondrial injury and cell death. Additionally, mitoneet is
   constitutively expressed at high levels in L929 fibrosarcoma cells and
   is required for L929 cells to undergo TNF alpha-induced necroptosis in
   the presence of caspase inhibition, indicating the importance of
   mitoneet to the necroptotic form of cell death.},

Abstract = {To explore the effect and mechanism of LncRNA LUCAT1 in cervical cancer

   were selected as the research objects. CC patients were selected as the
   study group (SG) and healthy physical examination patients were selected
   as the control group (CG). LUCAT1 expression level in peripheral blood
   was detected in the two groups. Human cervical carcinoma cells C33A, AV3
   and normal cervical epithelial cells H8 were purchased for biological
   behavior analysis. LUCAT1 was highly expressed in SG and cancer tissues
   (P<0.050), and it had good diagnostic value for the development of CC
   (P<0.001). It was closely related to the differentiation, pathological
   stage and metastasis of CC (P<0.001). The prognosis of CC patients was
   affected (P<0.050). After transfecting LUCAT1 into CC cells, it was
   found that the proliferation, invasion ability and anti-apoptosis
   protein of CC cells were significantly reduced, while the apoptosis rate
   and apoptosis protein were significantly increased by inhibiting LUCAT1
   expression (P<0.050). However, after transfecting miR-199b-5p into CC
   cells, it was found that the proliferation, invasion ability and
   anti-apoptosis protein of CC cells were significantly increased, while
   the apoptosis rate and apoptosis protein were significantly decreased by
   inhibiting LUCAT1 expression (P<0.050). LUCAT1 was highly expressed in
   CC. It was involved in the tumor development of CC by targeting
   miR-199b-5p, which was of great significance for the diagnosis and

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE-A high-protein diet (HPD) is known to promote the reduction of
   body fat, but the mechanisms underlying this change are unclear.
   AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin
   (mTOR) function as majors regulators of cellular metabolism that respond
   to changes in energy status, and recent data demonstrated that they also
   play a critical role in systemic energy balance. Here, we sought to
   determine whether the response of the AMPK and mTOR pathways could
   contribute to the molecular effects of an HPD.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Western blotting, confocal microscopy,
   chromatography, light microscopy, and RT-PCR assays were combined to
   explore the anorexigenic effects of an HPD.
   RESULTS-An HPD reduced food intake and induced weight loss in both
   normal rats and ob/ob mice. The intracerebroventricular administration
   of leucine reduced food intake, and the magnitude of weight loss and
   reduction of food intake in a leucine-supplemented diet are similar to
   that achieved by HPD in normal rats and in ob/ob mice, suggesting that
   leucine is a major component of the effects of an HPD. Leucine and HPD
   decrease AMPK and increase mTOR activity in the hypothalamus, leading to
   inhibition of neuropeptide Y and stimulation of pro-opiomelanocortin
   expression. Consistent with a cross-regulation between AMPK and mTOR to
   control food intake, our data show that the activation of these enzymes
   occurs in the same specific neuronal subtypes.
   CONCLUSIONS-These findings provide support for the hypothesis that AMPK
   and mTOR interact in the hypothalamus to regulate feeding during HPD in
   a leucine-dependent manner.},

Abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce necroptosis, wherein inhibition
   of caspase activity prevents apoptosis but initiates an alternative
   programmed necrosis. The activity of receptor-interacting
   serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK-1) is required for necroptosis
   to proceed, with suppression of RIPK-1 expression or inhibition of
   RIPK-1 activity with necrostatin-1 preventing TNF-induced necroptosis.
   Downstream from the TNF receptor, the generation of reactive oxygen
   species at the mitochondria has been identified as necessary for the
   execution of necroptosis; with antioxidants and inhibitors of
   mitochondrial complex I preventing TNF-induced cytotoxicity. However,
   components of the signaling pathway that lie between activated RIPK-1
   and the mitochondria are unknown. In the study reported here we
   demonstrate that during TNF-induced necroptosis, STAT3 is phosphorylated
   on serine 727, which is dependent on RIPK-1 expression or activity. The
   phosphorylation of STAT3 induces interaction with GRIM-19, a subunit of
   mitochondrial complex I, with a resultant translocation of STAT3 to the
   mitochondria, where it induces an increase in reactive oxygen species
   production and cell death.},

Abstract = {The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway plays an
   important role in processes critical for breast cancer progression and
   its upregulation confers increased resistance of cancer cells to
   chemotherapy and radiation. The present study aimed at determining the
   activity of ramentaceone, a constituent of species in the plant genera
   Drosera, toward breast cancer cells and defining the involvement of
   PI3K/Akt inhibition in ramentaceone-mediated cell death induction. The
   results showed that ramentaceone exhibited high antiproliferative
   activity toward breast cancer cells, in particular HER2-overexpressing
   breast cancer cells. The mode of cell death induced by ramentaceone was
   through apoptosis as determined by cytometric analysis of caspase
   activity and Annexin V staining. Apoptosis induction was found to be
   mediated by inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling and through targeting its
   downstream anti-apoptotic effectors. Ramentaceone inhibited PI3-kinase
   activity, reduced the expression of the PI3K protein and inhibited the
   phosphorylation of the Akt protein in breast cancer cells. The
   expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was decreased and the
   levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, were elevated.
   Moreover, inhibition of PI3K and silencing of Akt expression increased
   the sensitivity of cells to ramentaceone-induced apoptosis. In
   conclusion, our results indicate that ramentaceone induces apoptosis in
   breast cancer cells through PI3K/Akt signaling inhibition. These
   findings suggest further investigation of ramentaceone as a potential
   therapeutic agent in breast cancer therapy, in particular HER2-positive
   breast cancer.},

Abstract = {Objective: To assess prospectively the maternal and fetal outcome in
   women with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who undergone earlier
   splenectomy compared to women on medical therapy.Methods: A 5-year
   observational study included pregnant women in the first trimester
   previously diagnosed with primary ITP with 74 patients underwent
   splenectomy before pregnancy and 86 patients on medical therapy.
   Patients were followed throughout pregnancy and labour to record their
   obstetric outcome. Data were collected and tabulated.Results: There was
   a higher platelet count in the splenectomy group at enrollment (p<.05)
   and at delivery (p<.001). Higher number of patients in the medical group
   experienced bleeding episodes (p<.001), severe thrombocytopenia
   (p<.001), need for therapy (p<.001), complications of steroid therapy
   (p<.05), postpartum hemorrhage (p<.05), and defective lactation (p<.001)
   compared to patients in the splenectomy group. Higher rates of small for
   gestational age, preterm labour, and admission to neonatal intensive
   care unit (NICU) were observed in patients in the medical group (p<.05)
   compared to patients in the splenectomy group.Conclusion: Earlier
   splenectomy in patients with ITP may have a beneficial impact on
   obstetric outcome and should be explained to patients wishing to get
   pregnant. Further larger multicenter studies are warranted to confirm or
   refute our findings.},

Abstract = {Oxidative stress has been implicated in various human diseases,
   including the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Previous studies
   have shown the induction of oxidative stress in cultured cells
   expressing HCV genes. The transcription factor Nrf2 is known to be
   activated in response to oxidative stress, but the mechanism of its
   activation is not clearly understood. In this study, we first determined
   the induction of Nrf2 and then investigated the mechanism of Nrf2
   activation in human hepatoma cells infected with HCV (JFH-1). Our
   results showed the induction and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in a
   time-dependent manner. The HCV-mediated activation of Nrf2 was abrogated
   in the presence of an antioxidant, PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate),
   and a Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM {[}1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane
   N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester], which suggests a
   role for both reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signalling in the
   Nrf2-activation process. By using inhibitors of cellular kinases, we
   showed further that HCV-mediated phosphorylation/activation of Nrf2 is
   mediated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p38 MAPK and
   janus kinase. We also observed enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and its
   downstream substrate Bad in HCV-infected cells. Furthermore, by using a
   small interfering RNA approach, our results suggest a potential role for
   HCV-mediated Nrf2 activation in the survival of HCV-infected cells, a
   condition favourable for liver oncogenesis, Taken together, these
   results provide an insight into the mechanisms by which HCV induces
   intracellular events relevant to chronic HCV infection.},

Abstract = {Antiandrogens have demonstrated a protective effect for COVOD-19
   patients in observational and interventional studies. The goal of this
   study was to determine if proxalutamide, an androgen receptor
   antagonist, could be an effective treatment for men with COVID-19 in an
   outpatient setting. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
   clinical trial was conducted at two outpatient centers (Brasilia,
   Brazil). Patients were recruited from October 21 to December 24, 2020 (
   number, NCT04446429). Male patients with confirmed COVID-19 but not
   requiring hospitalization (COVID-19 8-point ordinal scale < 3) were
   administered proxalutamide 200 mg/day or placebo for up to 7 days. The
   primary endpoint was hospitalization rate at 30 days post-randomization.
   A total of 268 men were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. 134 patients
   receiving proxalutamide and 134 receiving placebo were included in the
   intention-to-treat analysis. The 30-day hospitalization rate was 2.2\%
   in men taking proxalutamide compared to 26\% in placebo, P < 0.001. The
   30-day hospitalization risk ratio was 0.09; 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 0.03-0.27. Patients in the proxalutamide arm more frequently
   reported gastrointestinal adverse events, however, no patient
   discontinued treatment. In placebo group, 6 patients were lost during
   follow-up, and 2 patients died from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
   Here we demonstrate the hospitalization rate in proxalutamide treated
   men was reduced by 91\% compared to usual care.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE We investigated the function of the Prep1 gene in
   insulin-dependent glucose homeostasis in liver.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Prep l action on insulin glucoregulatory
   function has been analyzed in liver of Prep1-hypomorphic mice
   (Prep1(i/i)), which express 2-3\% of Prep1 mRNA.
   RESULTS Based on euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies and
   measurement of glycogen content, livers from Prep1(i/i) mice feature
   increased sensitivity to insulin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of both
   insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 was
   significantly enhanced in Prep1(i/i) livers accompanied by a specific
   downregulation of the SYP and SHP1 tyrosine phosphatases. Prep1
   overexpression in HepG2 liver cells upregulated SYP and SHP1 and
   inhibited insulin-induced IR and IRS1/2 phosphorylation and was
   accompanied by reduced glycogen content. Consistently, overexpression of
   the Prep1 partner Pbx1, but not of p160MBP, mimicked Prep1 effects on
   tyrosine phosphorylations, glycogen content, and on SYP and SHP1
   expression. In Prep1 overexpressing cells, antisense silencing of SHP1,
   but not that of SYP, rescued insulin-dependent IR phosphorylation and
   glycogen accumulation. Both Prep1 and Pbx1 bind SHP1 promoter at a site
   located between nucleotides -2,113 and -1,778. This fragment features
   enhancer activity and induces luciferase function by 7-, 6-, and
   30-fold, respectively, in response to Prep 1, Pbx1, or both.
   CONCLUSIONS SHP1, a known silencer of insulin signal, is a
   transcriptional target of Prep1. In liver, transcriptional activation of
   SHP1 gene by Prep1 attenuates insulin signal transduction and reduces
   glucose storage. Diabetes 60:138-147, 2011},

Abstract = {The prevalence of weight problems is increasing worldwide. There is
   growing evidence that high body mass index (BMI) is associated with
   frontal lobe dysfunction and deficits in cognitive control. The present
   study aims to clarify the association between weight status and the
   degree of impairment in cognitive flexibility, i.e., the ability to
   efficiently switch from one task to another, by disentangling the
   preparatory and residual domains of task switching. Twenty-six normal
   weight (BMI < 25, five males) and twenty-six overweight (BMI >= 25,
   seven males) university students performed a task-switching paradigm
   that provides a relatively well-established diagnostic measure of
   proactive vs. reactive control with regard to cognitive flexibility.
   Compared to individuals with a BMI lower than 25, overweight (i.e., >=
   25) was associated with increased switching costs in the reactive
   switching condition (i.e., when preparation time is short), representing
   reduced cognitive flexibility in the preparatory domain. In addition,
   the overweight group reported significantly more depression and binge
   eating symptoms, although still indicating minimal depression. No
   between-group differences were found with regard to self-reported autism
   spectrum symptoms, impulsiveness, state-and trait anxiety, and cognitive
   reactivity to depression. The present findings are consistent with and
   extend previous literature showing that elevated BMI in young, otherwise
   healthy individuals is associated with significantly more switching
   costs due to inefficiency in the retrieval, implementation, and
   maintenance of task sets, indicating less efficient cognitive control
   functioning.},

Abstract = {Background Tracheal tumours can be surgically resected but most are an
   inoperable size at the time of diagnosis; therefore, new therapeutic
   options are needed. We report the clinical transplantation of the
   tracheobronchial airway with a stem-cell-seeded bioartificial
   nanocomposite.
   Methods A 36-year-old male patient, previously treated with debulking
   surgery and radiation therapy, presented with recurrent primary cancer
   of the distal trachea and main bronchi. After complete tumour resection,
   the airway was replaced with a tailored bioartificial nanocomposite
   previously seeded with autologous bone-marrow mononuclear cells via a
   bioreactor for 36 h. Postoperative granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
   filgrastim (10 mu g/kg) and epoetin beta (40 000 UI) were given over 14
   days. We undertook flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy,
   confocal microscopy epigenetics, multiplex, miRNA, and gene expression
   analyses.
   Findings We noted an extracellular matrix-like coating and proliferating
   cells including a CD105+ subpopulation in the scaffold after the
   reseeding and bioreactor process. There were no major complications, and
   the patient was asymptomatic and tumour free 5 months after trans
   plantation. The bioartificial nanocomposite has patent anastomoses,
   lined with a vascularised neomucosa, and was partly covered by nearly
   healthy epithelium. Post-operatively, we detected a mobilisation of
   peripheral cells displaying increased mesenchymal stromal cell
   phenotype, and upregulation of epoetin receptors, antiapoptotic genes,
   and miR-34 and miR-449 biomarkers. These findings, together with
   increased levels of regenerative-associated plasma factors, strongly
   suggest stem-cell homing and cell-mediated wound repair, extracellular
   matrix remodelling, and neovascularisation of the graft.
   Interpretation Tailor-made bioartificial scaffolds can be used to
   replace complex airway defects. The bioreactor reseeding process and
   pharmacological-induced site-specific and graft-specific regeneration
   and tissue protection are key factors for successful clinical outcome.},

Abstract = {The ocean is the main source of thermal inertia in the climate
   system(1). During recent decades, ocean heat uptake has been quantified
   by using hydrographic temperature measurements and data from the Argo
   float program, which expanded its coverage after 2007(2,3). However,
   these estimates all use the same imperfect ocean dataset and share
   additional uncertainties resulting from sparse coverage, especially
   before 2007(4,5). Here we provide an independent estimate by using
   measurements of atmospheric oxygen (O-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2)-levels
   of which increase as the ocean warms and releases gases-as a whole-ocean
   thermometer. We show that the ocean gained 1.33 +/- 0.20 x 10(22) joules
   of heat per year between 1991 and 2016, equivalent to a planetary energy
   imbalance of 0.83 +/- 0.11 watts per square metre of Earth's surface. We
   also find that the ocean-warming effect that led to the outgassing of
   O-2 and CO2 can be isolated from the direct effects of anthropogenic
   emissions and CO2 sinks. Our result-which relies on high-precision O-2
   measurements dating back to 1991(6)-suggests that ocean warming is at
   the high end of previous estimates, with implications for
   policy-relevant measurements of the Earth response to climate change,
   such as climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases(7) and the thermal
   component of sea-level rise(8).},

Abstract = {A novel solution plasma processing approach was developed to synthesize
   mesoporous amorphous FeOF nanococoons on a large scale via using NaF and
   FeCl3 center dot xH(2)O as the precursors, and CO2 released from the
   hydrolysis of urea as the growth director. The obtained mesoporous
   amorphous FeOF nanococoons deliver a reversible capacity of 238.9 mA h
   g(-1) at a current rate of 1 A g(-1) and show almost no degradation,
   even after 3000 cycles by adopting the optimized 1.0 M sodium
   trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaTFSA) in triglyme (TGM) as the electrolyte
   and tuning the cut-off voltage to 1.3 V. Furthermore, the nanococoons
   exhibit a capacity of 190.4 mA h g(-1) at an ultrahigh current density
   of 20 A g(-1) because of the coexisting pseudocapacitance-type reaction.
   Meanwhile, a commercial 18650-type battery was fabricated that exhibited
   a stable discharge capacity of 4897 mA h at 4 A for 300 cycles, which
   allows for consideration of this type of room-temperature battery in
   commercial utilization. The superior electrochemical performance of the
   mesoporous amorphous FeOF nanococoons is because of the collaboration of
   the optimized electrolyte, controlling the terminal voltage to 1.3 V,
   and their particular nanostructure, which significantly improve the
   ionic and electronic transport and intercalation kinetics of Na ions.},

Abstract = {Background \& Aims: In liver transplant recipients with graft hepatitis,
   the relevance of herpesviruses is not well defined.
   Methods: Viral loads of CMV, EBV, and HHV-6 were determined in blood and
   liver biopsies of 170 liver transplant recipients with graft hepatitis
   by quantitative PCR.
   Results: HHV-6-, CMV-, and EBV-DNA were detected in 58\%, 14\%, and 44\%
   of the biopsies, respectively, with coinfections in 34\%. High
   intrahepatic HHV-6 DNA levels (>75th percentile, 11.27 copies/1000
   cells) and detection of HHV-6 DNAemia were significantly associated with
   decreased graft survival after diagnosis of graft hepatitis (p = 0.014
   and p = 0.003, respectively, median follow-up was 23.8 months).
   Multivariate analysis confirmed high intrahepatic HHV-6 loads as an
   independent factor associated with reduced graft survival (adjusted
   hazard ratio 2.61, 95\% confidence interval 1.16-5.87). Low
   concentrations of HHV6 DNA in the liver, indicating latent infection,
   did not influence graft survival. Neither CMV nor EBV (qualitative
   detection and high virus loads) nor acute rejection (according to the
   BANFF score) affected graft survival. However, patients had been treated
   for CMV reactivations and acute rejections in this retrospective study.
   High age and high bilirubin levels were the other independent factors
   associated with reduced graft survival (adjusted hazard ratio 3.56 Cl
   1.52-8.34 and 3.23 Cl 1.50-6.96, respectively).
   Conclusions: High intrahepatic HHV-6-DNA levels are associated with
   decreased graft survival in liver transplant recipients with graft
   hepatitis. The significance of HHV-6 as potential etiology of graft
   hepatitis needs further evaluation. (C) 2012 European Association for

Abstract = {Purpose: The expression profile, clinical effects, and detailed roles of
   NOP14 antisense RNA 1 (NOP14-AS1) in tongue squamous cell carcinoma
   (TSCC) remain ambiguous and need to be further explored. Thus, this work
   was initiated to offer further solid evidence regarding the expression
   and roles of NOP14-AS1 in TSCC. Furthermore, additional efforts were
   exerted to reveal the molecular events by which NOP14-AS1 affects the
   malignant behaviours of TSCC.
   Methods: NOP14-AS1 expression was detected in TSCC tissues and cell
   lines using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometric analysis, Transwell
   migration and invasion assays, and xenograft tumor model analysis were
   performed to assess the malignant biological behaviors of TSCC cells
   after NOP14-AS1 depletion. Mechanistic studies were performed using
   bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA
   immunoprecipitation, and rescue experiments.
   Results: NOP14-AS1 upregulation was identified in TSCC tissues and cell
   lines. Patients with TSCC exhibiting a high NOP14-AS1 expression faced
   shorter overall survival than those with a low NOP14-AS1 expression.
   Functionally, NOP14-AS1 depletion facilitated apoptosis and impeded cell
   proliferation, migration, and invasion in TSCC. In vivo, the growth of
   TSCC cells was hindered by NOP14-AS1 depletion. Mechanically, NOP14-AS1
   functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging microRNA-665
   (miR-665), thereby overexpressing the target high mobility group box 3
   (HMGB3) of miR-665. Lastly, rescue experiments confirmed that the
   introduction of HMGB3 overexpression plasmid or miR-665 inhibitor could
   abrogate the inhibition of aggressive phenotypes triggered by NOP14-AS1
   knockdown.
   Conclusion: NOP14-AS1 executed pro-oncogenic activities in TSCC cells by
   targeting the miR-665/HMGB3 axis. The NOP14-AS1/miR-665/HMGB pathway may
   be a valuable prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for preventing
   TSCC.},

Abstract = {Histone H4 acetylation at lysine 12 (H4K12ac) has been reported to be
   associated with the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. The study
   intends to study whether H4K12ac participates in regulating the
   carcinogenic effect of Ras-ERK1/2 on osteosarcoma (OS). The plasmids of
   pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-Ras(WT) and pEGFP-K-Ras(G12V)(/T)(35S) were transfected
   into MG-63 cells, the protein levels of H4K12ac and ERK1/2 were analyzed
   by Western blot. Effects of H4K12ac on cell proliferation and migration
   of MG-63 cells were tested by
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide solution
   (MTT), transwell, soft-agar colony formation and flow cytometry assays.
   Effect of H4K12ac on the transcription of ERK1/2 downstream genes was
   analyzed by RT-qPCR and ChIP assays. The involvements of HDAT6, HAT1 and
   MDM2 in cell proliferation and migration of MG-63 cells were finally
   studied. We found that H4K12ac was specifically down-regulated by
   Ras-ERK1/2 activation in MG-63 cells. H4K12ac suppressed
   Ras-ERK1/2-induced cell viability, colony formation and migration in
   MG-63 cells. Additionally, HDAC6 silence recovered Ras-ERK1/2-repressed
   H4K12ac expression, as well as inhibited the carcinogenic effect of
   Ras-ERK1/2 on MG-63 cells. Besides, down-regulated H4K12ac induced by
   Ras-ERK1/2 was found to be associated with MDM2-mediated HAT1
   degradation. In conclusion, these results testified that Ras-ERK1/2
   signalling promoted the development of OS by mediating H4K12ac through
   MDM2-mediated HAT1 degradation.},

   Methods: We used CCK8, flow cytometry, migration and invasion assay to
   detect changes at the cellular level. PEG10, microRNA-34a-5p
   (miR-34a-5p) and TLX transfected by transfection assay and amplified by

   Results: H2O2-injury model was established. Knockdown PEG10 deteriorated
   H2O2-injury. miR-34a-5p was confirmed as a target of PEG10 and
   miR-34a-5p inhibitor remitted PEG10-induced H2O2-injury. Moreover, TLX
   was confirmed as a target miR-34a-5p and TLX remitted H2O2-injury. At
   last, TLX worked in H2O2-injury via Smad and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways.
   Conclusion: Knockdown PEG10 remitted H2O2-injury of PC-12 cells by

Abstract = {Mesoporous face-centered-cubic (fcc) In4Ni alloy nanorices (NRs) were
   successfully synthesized as superior catalysts for N2H4 dehydrogenation
   in aqueous solution via a facile solution plasma technique (SPT) in an
   ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
   ({[}BMIM]{[}BF4]). This incorporation introduces basic sites for
   dehydrogenation. Also, the synthesis of In and Ni weakens the
   interactions among generated adspecies such as H-2 and NHx and surface
   metal atoms. Alongside their unique NR structure, the as-prepared
   fcc-In4Ni alloy NRs exhibited superior performance for N2H4
   dehydrogenation in aqueous solution. The activation energy of the
   fcc-In4Ni alloy NRs was 38.9 +/- 1.0 kJ mol(-1). The NRs were also found
   to be stable for catalytic N2H4 dehydrogenation in aqueous solution,
   providing an average TOF value of 82.0 (mol of H-2 (mol of active In4Ni
   min)(-1)) over 30 h reaction. These fcc-In4Ni alloy NRs have
   demonstrated exceptional performance, which indicates that the
   construction, of hydrogen-producing systems from N2H4, capable of
   matching the performance of NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrogen-producing systems
   for fuel-cell applications, is a promising possibility.},

Abstract = {Purpose To investigate the role of lung ultrasound score (LUS) in
   assessing intubation timing for patients with severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Materials and methods
   Seventy-two patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   were admitted to a makeshift intensive care unit (ICU). All patients
   underwent bedside lung ultrasonography one to two times per day. The
   patients were either intubated, treated with noninvasive ventilation
   (NIV), or given high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after a discussion with
   the multidisciplinary group after their conditions worsened. Bedside
   lung ultrasound was performed daily after intubation, and patients
   received mechanical ventilation. Lung ultrasound was performed on days
   1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after patients were admitted to the ICU; if the
   patient was intubated, LUS determination was performed before intubation
   within 24 h (T1) and on days 1, 2, 5, and 7 after intubation (T2, T3,
   T4, and T5, respectively).The goal of this study was to evaluate the
   severity of lung aeration loss in intubated and non-intubated patients
   with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia by ultrasound at different time points within
   one week. Results A total of 16 patients were included in this study,
   including nine who were intubated and mechanically ventilated and seven
   patients without intubation. The number of elderly individuals in the
   intubated group was higher than in the non-intubated group (P < 0.05).
   In addition, there were more male than female patients in both groups.
   Patient characteristics (BMI, SOFA, and PaO2/FiO(2)value) were similar
   between the two groups (P > 0.05). The 28-day mortality rate of
   intubated patients was higher than that of non-intubated patients; six
   patients in the intubated group and two patients in the non-intubated
   group died. Nine intubated patients showed changes in LUS within seven
   days (n = 9). The mean LUS within 24 h before intubation was 12.8 +/-
   1.3. LUS was significantly higher on T1 than on T5 (P <0.05), and did
   not significantly differ from T1 to T4. Comparing LUS between intubated
   and non-intubated patients on T1 showed that the LUS of intubated
   patients was significantly higher than that of non-intubated patients (P
   <0.05). Between the two patient groups, oxygenation index was 140.1 +/-
   7.7vs. 137.8 +/- 5.9 on T1, and the respiratory rate of the two groups
   was 26 +/- 5vs. 28 +/- 4 breaths/min. Neither oxygenation index nor RR
   significantly differed between the two groups. Conclusion LUS may be an
   effective tool for assessing intubation timing in critically ill
   patients with Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia.},

Abstract = {Purpose: A novel method for differentiating and treating bipolar
   disorder cycling on the depressive pole from patients who are suffering
   a major depressive episode is explored in this work. To confirm the
   diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 bipolar disorder, the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria require that at
   least one manic or hypomanic episode be identified. History of one or
   more manic or hypomanic episodes may be impossible to obtain,
   representing a potential blind spot in the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.
   Many bipolar patients who cycle primarily on the depressive side for
   many years carry a misdiagnosis of recurrent major depression, leading
   to treatment with antidepressants that achieve little or no relief of
   symptoms. This article discusses a novel approach for diagnosing and
   treating patients with bipolar disorder cycling on the depressive pole
   versus patients with recurrent major depression.
   Patients and methods: Patients involved in this study were formally
   diagnosed with recurrent major depression under DSM-IV criteria and had
   no medical history of mania or hypomania to support the diagnosis of
   bipolar disorder. All patients had suffered multiple depression
   treatment failures in the past, when evaluated under DSM-IV guidelines,
   secondary to administration of antidepressant drugs and/or serotonin
   with dopamine amino acid precursors.
   Results: This study contained 1600 patients who were diagnosed with
   recurrent major depression under the DSM-IV criteria. All patients had
   no medical history of mania or hypomania. All patients experienced no
   relief of depression symptoms on level 3 amino acid dosing values of the
   amino acid precursor dosing protocol. Of 1600 patients studied, 117
   (7.3\%) nonresponder patients were identified who experienced no relief
   of depression symptoms when the serotonin and dopamine amino acid
   precursor dosing values were adjusted to establish urinary serotonin and
   urinary dopamine levels in the Phase III therapeutic ranges. All of the
   117 nonresponders who achieved no relief of depression symptoms were
   continued on this amino acid dosing value, and a mood-stabilizing drug
   was started. At this point, complete relief of depression symptoms,
   under evaluation with DSM-IV criteria, was noted in 114 patients within
   1-5 days. With further dose adjustment of the mood-stabilizing drug, the
   remaining three nonresponders achieved relief of depression symptoms.
   Conclusion: Resolution of depression symptoms with the addition of a
   mood-stabilizing drug in combination with proper levels of serotonin and
   dopamine amino acid precursors was the basis for a clinical diagnosis of
   bipolar disorder cycling on the depressive pole.},

Abstract = {Neural stem cells (NSCs) transplantation is one of the most promising
   strategies for the treatment of CA-induced brain damage. The
   transplanted NSCs could differentiate into new neuron and replace the
   damaged one. However, the poor survival of NSCs in severe hypoxic
   condition is the limiting step to make the best use of this kind of
   therapy. In the present study, we investigated whether the
   overexpression of miR-26a improves the survival of NSCs in hypoxic
   environment in vitro and in vivo. In vitro hypoxia injury model is
   established in NSCs by CoCl2 treatment, and in vivo cardiac arrest (CA)
   model is established in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction is used to detect the mRNA level and Western
   blot is used to examine the protein level of indicated genes. TUNEL
   staining and flow cytometry are applied to evaluate apoptosis.
   Dual-luciferase reporter assay is utilized to analyze the target gene of
   miR-26a. The expression of miR-26a is reduced in both in vitro and in
   vivo hypoxic model. MiR-26a directly targets 3'-UTR of glycogen synthase
   kinase 3 beta (GSK-3 beta), resulting in increased beta-catenin
   expression and decreased apoptosis of NSCs. Overexpression of miR-26a in
   transplanted NSCs improves the survival of NSCs and neurological
   function in CA rats. MiR-26a prevents NSCs from apoptosis by activating
   beta-catenin signaling pathway in CA-induced brain damage model.
   Modulating miR-26a expression could be a potential strategy to attenuate
   brain damage induced by CA.},

Abstract = {During the present study, we explored the protective effects of
   autophagy on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (ERS) induced apoptosis
   belonging to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in rat models with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Fifty-six 12-week-old male
   Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into the COPD group
   (rats exposed to cigarette smoke (CS)), the 3-methyladenine (3-MA)
   intervention group (COPD rats were administrated with 10 mg/kg autophagy
   inhibitors), the chloroquine (CQ)-intervention group (COPD rats were
   administrated 40mg/kg CQ), and the control group (rats breathed in
   normal saline). The forced expiratory volume in 0.3 s/forced vital
   capacity (FEV0.3/FVC\%), inspiratory resistance (RI), and dynamic lung
   compliance (Cdyn) were measured and recorded. The expressions of
   PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous
   protein (CHOP) were detected by immunohistochemistry. The cell apoptotic
   rates of AECs were analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
   (TdT) mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. The
   expression levels of light chain 3 (LC3-II), p62, Beclin-1, ATG5, ATG7,
   Caspase-12, and Caspase-3 were detected by Western blotting. Results
   showed that the COPD group exhibited a lower FEV0.3/FVC\% and Cdyn, and
   a higher RI than the control group. Compared with the control group, the
   integrated optical density (IOD) values of PERK and CHOP, the apoptotic
   rate of AECs, and expressions of LC3-II, Beclin-1, ATG5, ATG7,
   Caspase-3, and Caspase-12 expressions were significantly higher, whereas
   p62 expression was significantly lower in the COPD group. Based on the
   results obtained during the present study, it became clear that the
   inhibition of autophagy could attenuate the ERS-induced apoptosis of
   AECs in rats with COPD.},

   ovarian cancer-specific transcript 2 (LncRNA-HOST2) on cell
   proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of human hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC) cell line SMMC-7721. HCC tissues and adjacent normal
   tissues from 162 HCC patients were collected. The HCC cell lines were
   assigned into the control group (regular culture), negative control (NC)
   group (transfected with siRNA) and experimental group (transfected with
   Lnc-HOST2 siRNA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to
   detect the expression of LncRNA-HOST2. Cell proliferation was detected
   by CCK-8 and colony-forming assays, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry and
   cell migration by Scratch test. Transwell assay was used to evaluate
   cell migration and invasion abilities. LncRNA-HOST2 expression in the
   HCC tissues increased 2-10 times than that in the adjacent normal
   tissues. Compared with the HL-7702 cell line, LncRNA-HOST2 expression in
   HepG2, SMMC-7721 and Huh7 cell lines was all up-regulated, but the
   SMMC-7721 cell had the highest Lnc-HOST2 expression. The LncRNA-HOST2
   expression in the experimental group was down-regulated as compared with
   the control and NC groups. In comparison with the control and NC groups,
   cloned cells reduced, cell apoptosis increased, clone-forming ability
   weakened and inhibitory rate of colony formation increased in the
   experimental group. The cells migrating and penetrating into the
   transwell chamber were fewer in the experimental group than those in the
   control and NC groups. The experimental group exhibited slow wound
   healing and decreased cell migration area after 48 h. These findings
   indicate that LncRNA-HOST2 can promote cell proliferation, migration and
   invasion and inhibit cell apoptosis in human HCC cell line SMMC-7721.},

Abstract = {Purposes: Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 525 (LINC00525), a long
   noncoding RNA, has been implicated in the carcinogenesis and progression
   of many human cancer types. However, the detailed roles of LINC00525 in
   chordoma and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here,
   we aimed to determine whether LINC00525 could modulate the oncogenicity
   of chordoma cells and to elucidate in detail the molecular events
   underlying these tumor-promoting activities.
   Methods: Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reactions
   were performed to assess LINC00525 expression in chordoma. The effects
   of LINC00525 silencing on chordoma cell proliferation, apoptosis,
   migration, and invasiveness in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were
   respectively tested using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, migration and
   invasion assays, and xenograft experiments.
   Results: High LINC00525 expression levels were detected in chordoma
   tissues. The proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of
   chordoma cells in vitro and their tumor growth in vivo were suppressed
   by the LINC00525 knockdown, whereas apoptosis was induced by it.
   Mechanistically, LINC00525 acted as a molecular sponge of
   microRNA-505-3p (miR505-3p) and upregulated the expression of high
   mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which is directly targeted by miR-505-3p.
   Rescue assays indicated that increasing the output of miR505-3p-HMGB1
   axis attenuated the effects of LINC00525 depletion on chordoma cells.
   Conclusion: LINC00525, a pro-oncogenic long noncoding RNA, promotes
   chordoma progression by regulating the miR-505-3p-HMGB1 axis. The
   LINC00525-miR-505-3p- HMGB1 be a novel therapeutic in chordoma.},

Abstract = {In patients harboring the IR1152 mutant insulin receptor, hepatic
   glucose production was normally suppressed by insulin. Hepatocytes
   without the insulin receptor gene and expressing IR1152 (Hep(MUT)) also
   showed normal insulin suppression of glucose production and full insulin
   response of glycogen synthase. In contrast, expression of the IR1152
   mutant in skeletal muscle maximally increased glucose uptake and
   storage, preventing further insulin stimulation. IRS-1 phosphorylation
   was normally stimulated by insulin in both intact Hep(MUT) and L6
   skeletal muscle cells expressing the IR1152 mutant (L6(MUT)). At
   variance, IRS-2 phosphorylation exhibited high basal levels with no
   further insulin-dependent increase in L6(MUT) but almost normal
   phosphorylation, both basal and insulin-stimulated, in the Hep(MUT)
   cells. In vitro, IR1152 mutant preparations from both the L6(MUT) and
   the Hep(MUT) cells exhibited increased basal and no insulin-stimulated
   phosphorylation of IRS-2 immobilized from either muscle or liver cells.
   IR1152 internalization in liver and muscle cells closely paralleled the
   ability of this mutant to phosphorylate IRS-2 in vivo in these cells.
   Block of receptor internalization (wild-type and mutant) in the liver
   and muscle cells also inhibited IRS-2, but not IRS-1, phosphorylation.
   Thus, the mechanisms controlling insulin receptor internalization differ
   in liver and skeletal muscle cells and may enable IR1152 to control
   glucose metabolism selectively in liver. In both cell types, receptor
   internalization seems necessary for IRS-2 but not IRS-1 phosphorylation.},

Abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most developing cancer worldwide
   and Lynch syndrome (LS) accounts for 3-4\% of CRC. Genetic alteration in
   any of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene is the major cause of LS that
   disrupt the normal upstream and downstream MMR events. Germline mutation
   of MLH1 in heterozygous state have an increased risk for CRC. Defective
   MMR pathway mostly results in microsatellite instability (MSI) that
   occurs in high percentage of CRC associated tumors. Here, we reported a
   patient with LS like metastatic CRC (mCRC) associated with other related
   cancers. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the proband was performed to
   identify potential causative gene. Genetic screening validated by Sanger
   sequencing identified a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 12 of
   MLH1 (c.1151T>A, p.V384D). The clinical significance of identified
   variant was elucidated on the basis of clinicopathological data,
   computational predictions and various in vitro functional analysis. In
   silico predictions classified the variant to be deleterious and
   evolutionary conserved. In vitro functional studies revealed a
   significant decrease in protein expression because of stability defect
   leading to loss of MMR activity. Mutant residue found in MutL transducer
   domain of MLH1 that localized in the nucleus but translocation was not
   found to be significantly disturbed. In conclusion, our study give
   insight into reliability of combinatorial prediction approach of in
   silico and in vitro expression analysis. Hence, we highlighted the
   pathogenic correlation of MLH1 variant with LS associated CRC as well as
   help in earlier diagnosis and surveillance for improved management and
   genetic counselling.},

   present study was undertaken to address the reduced risk, by vitamin D
   supplementation, of falls and hip fractures in patients with vascular
   Parkinsonism (VP) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Patients and methods: In the open-label-study, 94 elderly patients with
   VP and 92 age-matched patients with PD were followed for 2 years. All
   patients received 1200 IU ergocalciferol daily. The number of falls per
   person and incidence of hip fractures were compared between the two
   groups.
   Results: At baseline, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels were in
   the deficient range (<25 nmol/L) in all patients, and vitamin D
   treatment enhanced serum 25-OHD and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels in
   both groups. Improved muscle strength of lower extremities was observed
   in both groups. There was significant difference between the two groups
   in the number of falls per subject during the 2 years (1.9 +/- 0.5 in
   the PD group and 0.8 +/- 0.4 in the VP group, P < 0.001). Hip fractures
   occurred in seven of 88 in the PD group and one in 90 of the VP group
   during the 2-year study period (P = 0.035).
   Conclusion: It is suggested that vitamin D decreases falls and hip
   fractures in VP by increasing muscle strength but not in PD.},

Abstract = {Objective To study the tocolytic action of nifedipine combined with
   sildenafil citrate (SC) and if the combination is superior to nifedipine
   alone in inhibiting threatened preterm labour (PTL). Design Prospective
   randomised study. Setting An Egyptian university hospital. Population
   Women with threatened PTL who received either nifedipine with SC or
   nifedipine alone. Methods Patients were randomly allocated to receive
   either (1) nifedipine 20 mg orally (stat dose), followed by 10 mg orally
   every 6-8 hours at the same time as vaginal administration of SC (25 mg
   at 8-hourly intervals) or (2) nifedipine alone. Medications were
   continued for 48-72 hours. Main outcome measures The percentage of women
   who remained undelivered during hospitalisation. Results From January
   2015 to November 2016, 239 women were randomised. The baseline
   characteristics of participants were similar. Nifedipine combined with
   SC was associated with more women remaining undelivered (81.8 versus
   68.6\%; P = 0.018) during hospitalisation. Regarding secondary outcomes,
   the addition of SC was also associated with fewer deliveries within 7
   days of admission (9.1 versus 20.3\%; P = 0.014), prolonged latency (29
   versus 7 days; P = 0.002), fewer admissions to neonatal intensive care
   units (31.4 versus 44.1\%; P = 0.043), fewer very preterm deliveries
   (from 28 to <32 weeks, 20.7 versus 38.1\%; P = 0.043), and increased
   neonatal birthweight (1900 versus 1500 g; P = 0.018). Conclusions
   Vaginal SC combined with nifedipine is an effective option for tocolytic
   therapy during threatened PTL. Tweetable abstract Vaginal SC enhances
   the tocolytic effect of nifedipine.},

   of saffron to induce cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in lung cancer
   cells (A549). We also examined the caspase-dependent pathways activation
   of saffron-induced apoptosis against the A549 cells. A549 cells were

   morphological changes, cell viability, and apoptosis were determined by
   the normal invertmicroscope, MTT assay, Annexin V and propidium iodide,
   and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Activated caspases were
   detected by treatment of saffron in lung cancer cells using
   fluorescein-labeled inhibitors of polycaspases. The proliferation of the
   A549 cells were decreased after treatment with saffron in a dose-and
   time-dependent manner. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased with
   saffron concentrations. Saffron induced morphological changes, decreased
   percentage of viable cells, and induced apoptosis. Saffron could induce
   apoptosis in the A549 cells and activate caspase pathways. The levels of
   caspases involved in saffron-induced apoptosis in the A549 cells
   indicating caspase-dependent pathway were induced by saffron. The
   anticancer activity of the aqueous extract of saffron could be
   attributed partly to its inhibition of the cell proliferation and
   induction of apoptosis in cancer cells through caspase-dependent
   pathways activation.},

Abstract = {Rationale: Age and coronary artery disease may negatively affect the
   function of human cardiac stem cells (hCSCs) and their potential
   therapeutic efficacy for autologous cell transplantation in the failing
   heart.
   Objective: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2, and angiotensin II
   (Ang II), as well as their receptors, IGF-1R, IGF-2R, and AT1R, were
   characterized in c-kit(+) hCSCs to establish whether these systems would
   allow us to separate hCSC classes with different growth reserve in the
   aging and diseased myocardium.
   Methods and Results: C-kit(+) hCSCs were collected from myocardial
   samples obtained from 24 patients, 48 to 86 years of age, undergoing
   elective cardiac surgery for coronary artery disease. The expression of
   IGF-1R in hCSCs recognized a young cell phenotype defined by long
   telomeres, high telomerase activity, enhanced cell proliferation, and
   attenuated apoptosis. In addition to IGF-1, IGF-1R(+) hCSCs secreted
   IGF-2 that promoted myocyte differentiation. Conversely, the presence of
   IGF-2R and AT1R, in the absence of IGF-1R, identified senescent hCSCs
   with impaired growth reserve and increased susceptibility to apoptosis.
   The ability of IGF-1R(+) hCSCs to regenerate infarcted myocardium was
   then compared with that of unselected c-kit(+) hCSCs. IGF-1R(+) hCSCs
   improved cardiomyogenesis and vasculogenesis. Pretreatment of IGF-1R(+)
   hCSCs with IGF-2 resulted in the formation of more mature myocytes and
   superior recovery of ventricular structure.
   Conclusions: hCSCs expressing only IGF-1R synthesize both IGF-1 and
   IGF-2, which are potent modulators of stem cell replication, commitment
   to the myocyte lineage, and myocyte differentiation, which points to
   this hCSC subset as the ideal candidate cell for the management of human
   heart failure. (Circ Res. 2011;108:1467-1481.)},

Abstract = {Background
   Brief cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an emerging treatment for
   schizophrenia in community settings; however, further trials are needed,
   especially in non-Western countries.
   Aims
   To test the effects of brief CBT for Chinese patients with schizophrenia
   in the community (trial registration: ChiCTR-TRC-13003709).
   Method
   A total of 220 patients with schizophrenia from four districts of
   Beijing were randomly assigned to either brief CBT plus treatment as
   usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Patients were assessed at baseline,
   post-treatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups by raters masked to
   group allocation.
   Results
   At the post-treatment assessment and the 12-month follow-up, patients
   who received brief CBT showed greater improvement in overall symptoms,
   general psychopathology, insight and social functioning. In total,
   37.3\% of those in the brief CBT plus TAU group experienced a clinically
   significant response, compared with only 19.1\% of those in the TAU
   alone group (P=0.003).
   Conclusions
   Brief CBT has a positive effect on Chinese patients with schizophrenia
   in the community.},

   storage performance 278.1 mA h g(-1) (corresponding to Al0.27TiO2) at a
   current density of 0.05 A g(-1), but also exhibit an excellent rate
   capability (141.3 mA h g (1) at a current density of 2.0 A g (1)) with

Abstract = {Nrf2-mediated coordinated induction of a battery of defensive genes is a
   critical mechanism in cellular protection and survival. INrf2 (Keap1),
   an inhibitor of Nrf2, functions as an adaptor for Cul3 center dot
   Rbx1-mediated degradation of Nrf2. A majority of the INrf2/Cul3 center
   dot Rbx1 complex is localized in the cytosol that degrades cytosolic
   Nrf2. However, 10-15\% of INrf2 is also localized inside the nucleus.
   INrf2 does not contain a defined nuclear import signal, and the
   mechanism of nuclear import and its function inside the nucleus remain
   obscure. Present studies demonstrate that the DGR region of INrf2 is
   required for nuclear import of INrf2. Studies also demonstrate that Cul3
   and Rbx1 are also imported inside the nucleus in complex with INrf2.
   Interestingly, Nrf2 and prothymosin-alpha both bind to the DGR region of
   INrf2. However, it is prothymosin-alpha and not Nrf2 that mediates
   nuclear import of INrf2/Cul3 center dot Rbx1 complex. Antioxidant
   treatment increases nuclear import of INrf2/Cul3 center dot Rbx1
   complex. The INrf2/Cul3 center dot Rbx1 complex inside the nucleus
   exchanges prothymosin-alpha with Nrf2, resulting in degradation of Nrf2.
   These results led to the conclusion that prothymosin-alpha-mediated
   nuclear import of INrf2/Cul3 center dot Rbx1 complex leads to
   ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2 inside the nucleus presumably to
   regulate nuclear level of Nrf2 and rapidly switch off the activation of
   Nrf2 downstream gene expression.},

Abstract = {Background: This paper documents a retrospective pilot study of a novel
   approach for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
   with amino acid precursors of serotonin and dopamine in conjunction with
   urinary monoamine assays subjected to organic cation transporter (OCT)
   functional status determination. The goal of this research was to
   document the findings and related considerations of a retrospective
   chart review study designed to identify issues and areas of concern that
   will define parameters for a prospective controlled study.
   Methods: This study included 85 patients, aged 4-18 years, who were
   treated with a novel amino acid precursor protocol. Their clinical
   course during the first 8-10 weeks of treatment was analyzed
   retrospectively. The study team consisted of PhD clinical psychologists,
   individuals compiling clinical data from records, and a statistician.
   The patients had been treated with a predefined protocol for
   administering amino acid precursors of serotonin and dopamine, along
   with OCT assay interpretation as indicated.
   Results: In total, 67\% of participants achieved significant improvement
   with only amino acid precursors of serotonin and dopamine. In patients
   who achieved no significant relief of symptoms with only amino acid
   precursors, OCT assay interpretation was utilized. In this subgroup,
   30.3\% achieved significant relief following two or three urine assays
   and dosage changes as recommended by the assay results. The total
   percentage of patients showing significant improvement was 77\%.
   Conclusion: The efficacy of this novel protocol appears superior to some
   ADHD prescription drugs, and therefore indicates a need for further
   studies to verify this observation. The findings of this study justify
   initiation of further prospective controlled studies in order to
   evaluate more formally the observed benefits of this novel approach in
   the treatment of ADHD.},

Abstract = {Ethanol increases the vulnerability of mitochondria to induction of the
   mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Cyclophilin-D activity
   enhances the potential for the permeability transition pore (PTP) to
   open. In the present study, we demonstrate that ethanol and its
   metabolism sensitize the PTP to opening, in part by increasing the
   acetylation and activity of cyclophilin-D. This effect of ethanol is
   mediated by inhibiting the activity of sirtuin-3, an NAD(+) dependent
   deacetylase that is localized to the mitochondrial matrix. The
   ethanol-enhanced acetylation of cyclophilin-D also increases the
   interaction of cyclophilin-D with the adenine nucleotide translocator-1
   (ANT-1) and is dependent on ethanol metabolism. Moreover, activation of
   AMPK, a known positive modulator of sirtuin activity, prevented the
   ethanol-induced suppression of sirtuin-3 activity and the attendant
   increase of cyclophilin-D acetylation, activity and association with
   ANT-1. Additionally, AMPK reactivation of sirtuin-3 prevented the
   sensitization to the MPT and the enhancement of cell killing by TNF in
   cells exposed to ethanol.},

Title = {First-line tandem high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell
   transplantation versus single high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem
   cell transplantation in multiple myeloma, a systematic review of
   controlled studies},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {10},
Abstract = {Background
   Several clinical studies have compared single with tandem (also called
   double) autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) as first-line
   treatment in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), one of the
   leading indications for ASCT worldwide.
   Objectives
   The present Cochrane Review compares tandem autologous stem cell
   transplantation (TASCT) with single autologous stem cell transplantation
   (SASCT) as first-line treatment in patients with symptomatic MM with
   respect to overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), quality of
   life (QoL) and treatment-or transplantation-related mortality.
   Search methods
   We systematically identified controlled trials published between January
   1995 and May 2011 in two bibliographic databases (MEDLINE and CENTRAL)
   and in clinical trial registries.
   Selection criteria
   One researcher screened references for controlled trials to determine
   eligibility for the systematic review (SR) according to pre-specified
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, reflecting characteristics of disease
   and the interventions. We required a minimal set of details to be
   reported for observational studies for the studies to be included.
   Data collection and analysis
   We critically evaluated eligible trials with respect to quality of
   design and actual performance. One researcher extracted individual trial
   results, which were checked by another researcher. We recapitulated the
   results of the individual trials in a standardised way for the SR in
   order to allow a systematic assessment of potential sources of bias.
   Main results
   Overall, we identified 14 controlled studies. One registered randomised
   controlled trial (RCT) is still recruiting patients at the time of this
   review and no clinical results have been published. Two registered RCTs
   have remained unpublished despite their termination. Publications on one
   RCT had been retracted. We excluded five observational studies since
   neither patients nor treatment regimens were sufficiently characterised
   to allow an assessment of potential confounding by indication. We
   conducted a SR of study designs, definition of endpoints, treatment
   regimens and baseline characteristics of patients in the five included
   RCTs (two full-text publications, three conference presentations)
   enrolling1506 patients in total. Because we identified substantial
   clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we refrained from conducting
   a formal meta-analysis.
   While we included only previously untreated, symptomatic patients with
   MM the treatment regimens differed notably with respect to acute
   toxicity, between trials and also between study arms. Compared to state
   of the art treatment standards, the treatment regimens applied in all
   trials have to be considered as below standard from a contemporary
   perspective in at least one component.
   Three trials were likely to have the potential of being highly biased
   while two RCTs had a moderate potential for bias. The observed treatment
   effects in the set of included trials may have been influenced by a
   steep decrease in compliance with the second ASCT and the concomitant
   selection of patients. In addition, OS data were confounded by the
   treatment subsequent to first-line therapy.
   OS was statistically significantly improved in one trial only. While EFS
   was prolonged in four of the five trials, the median prolongation ranged
   between three to 12 months, with an uncertain direction of bias in the
   individual trials. QoL was not reported in any study. Results concerning
   treatment-or transplantation-related mortality could not be adequately
   assessed due to substantial differences in definitions between trials
   and low reporting quality.
   Authors' conclusions
   We did not consider any study to be sufficiently informative for
   contemporary treatment decisions concerning the question single versus
   tandem ASCT in view of inherent biases. In addition, none of the trials
   integrated the so-called ``novel agents{''} which are now considered
   standard treatment for MM. To improve the quality of future studies,
   sample size calculations should consider the potentially steep decrease
   in compliance with the second ASCT. Reporting of results of treatment-or
   transplantation-related mortality should clearly specify the type and
   number of events (the numerator) in a well-defined population (the
   denominator).},

Title = {Urological results and patient satisfaction in adolescents after surgery
   for proximal hypospadias in childhood},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY},

Abstract = {Background
   Proximal hypospadias repair is associated with a considerable
   complication risk. Long-term follow-up is required to present realistic
   expectations in pre-operative counseling.
   Objective
   To investigate adolescents after childhood surgery for proximal
   hypospadias in a prospective cohort study describing the urological
   outcome, complication rates and patient satisfaction with penile
   appearance.
   Study design
   39 adolescents >= 14 years with penoscrotal to perineal hypospadias and
   primary urethroplasty (tubularized incised plate (TIP), preputial flap
   as Onlay or tubularized (Duckett)) from 1996 to 2005 at a single center
   were evaluated. The clinical assessment, at Md 16.5 years (14-25),
   included voiding history, genital examination including the Hypospadias
   Objective Scoring Evaluation (HOSE), uroflowmetry plus chart data from
   previous urinary flows and evaluation of patient satisfaction using the
   Penile Perception Score (PPS).
   Results Twenty-nine patients with penoscrotal and 10 with
   scrotal/perineal hypospadias underwent surgery with TIP (N = 14), Onlay
   (N = 14) and Duckett (N = 11). Uroflows improved significantly compared
   with prepubertal maximal flows. Impaired flow rate (<10 mL/s) was found
   in 14\% (5/36). Fifty-one percent (20/39) required reoperations, 29\%
   (4/14) of TIP, 50\% (7/14) of Onlay and 82\% (9/11) of Duckett (p =
   0.0062). Median penile length in adolescence was 8.7 cm (4.0-11.0).
   Forty-four percent (12/27) of patients were dissatisfied with penile
   length. Patients were `satisfied' or `very satisfied' with meatal
   position and shape despite HOSE for meatal position being 11\% (4/38)
   distal, 76\% (29/38) proximal glanular and 13\% (5/38) coronal. TIP
   patients had more curvature at puberty than Duckett (p = 0.0062).
   Patients that had a decurvature procedure had shorter penile length (p Z
   0.019).
   Discussion A high complication rate is previously described,
   predominantly within the first years. Our study shows 50\% of
   reoperations were performed after >3 years, illustrating the need for
   long-term follow-up. Patient satisfaction with a deviant meatal position
   is rarely reported {[}1,2]. Our results support a conservative approach
   to an asymptomatic retracted meatus. Limitations of this descriptive
   study are the non-comparable groups and the retrospective data for
   correlation, impeding evaluation of prognostic outcome-factors. The
   shorter penile length found in patients after plication, and increased
   curvature after TIP, is therefore merely descriptive. However, the
   findings are in line with earlier publications suggesting limited use of
   TIP, and plication (recommending ventral lengthening instead) to avoid
   penile shortening and curvature in these cases {[}3-5].
   Conclusions The urological long-term outcome after proximal hypospadias
   repair is good, although late reoperations are common. In adolescence,
   patients were dissatisfied with the short penile length but satisfied
   with meatal position, indicating that in proximal hypospadias,
   preserving penile length and correcting curvature are prioritized over a
   distal meatus.},

Abstract = {The following article from Artificial Organs, Selective
   Cerebro-Myocardial Perfusion Under Mild Hypothermia During Primary
   Repair for Aortic Coarctation With Ventricular Septal Defect by Huiwen
   Chen, Haifa Hong, Zhongqun Zhu and Jinfen Liu, published online on 2

   retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editor-in-Chief,
   Paul S. Malchesky, the International Center for Artificial Organs and
   Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc. The retraction has been
   agreed due to simultaneous publication of a substantially similar
   article, Continuous Cerebral and Myocardial Perfusion During One-Stage
   Repair for Aortic Coarctation With Ventricular Septal Defect, by Huiwen
   Chen, Haifa Hong, Zhongqun Zhu and Jinfen Liu, in Pediatric Cardiology 7
   November 2012 {[}Epub ahead of print]. Controversy still exists on the
   use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and selective
   antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) on postoperative recovery. Selective
   cerebro-myocardial perfusion (SCMP) has been described in neonatal and
   infant arch surgery. We therefore report outcomes of patients undergoing
   SCMP under mild hypothermia compared with DHCA and SACP. One hundred ten
   consecutive patients undergoing anatomic reconstruction of coarctation
   of the aorta (CoA) with ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure between
   January 1999 and July 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients
   repaired under continuous cerebral and myocardial perfusion technique
   with mild hypothermia (32 degrees C) (group A, n=60) were compared with
   those repaired under DHCA (18 degrees C) and SACP (group B, n=50). In
   group A, single arterial cannula perfusion technique was used in 45
   (75\%) patients, and dual arterial cannula perfusion technique was used
   in 15 (25\%) patients. Preoperative data were similar in both groups.
   There were no hospital mortalities in group A compared with two (4\%) in
   group B. Compared with group B, group A had shorter myocardial ischemic
   time and cardiopulmonary time, fewer delayed sternal closures, shorter
   time to extubation, lower postoperative lactate levels, and fewer
   patients with low cardiac output requiring extracorporeal membrane
   oxygenation or multiorgan failure. During the postoperative course,
   there were no clinical or electrical neurologic events in either group.
   The mean length of follow-up for group A was 5.2 +/- 3.2 years, and for
   group B, it was 7.5 +/- 3.1 years (P=0.048). There was one late death in
   group B. There was no late death in group A. The actuarial survival for
   the two groups was similar (100\% for group A vs. 96\% for group B,
   P=0.264). The freedom from all types of cardiac reintervention was
   96.7\% in group A and 89.6\% in group B (P=0.688). All patients were
   free from neurologic symptoms. Our perfusion strategy using continuous
   SCMP with mild hypothermia for CoA with VSD repair is feasible, is safe,
   was associated with improved postoperative recovery, and should be
   considered as one of the choices.},

Title = {THE STRESSING MISTAKES AND SPECTACULAR SUCCESSES IN THE STUDIES OF THE
   PLANT STRESS HORMONE RECEPTORS},
Journal = {POSTEPY BIOLOGII KOMORKI},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {713-720},
Abstract = {The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) coordinates plant responses to
   stressors such as drought, extreme temperature and high salinity, as
   well regulates non-stress responses including seed formation and
   maturation, seed and bud dormancy, root growth, leaf senescence, and
   transition between vegetative and reproductive growth. ABA, similarly
   like the others plant hormones, functions through a complex network of
   signaling pathway, where ABA signal perception by ABA receptors is the
   primary event that triggers downstream signaling cascades to induce the
   final physiological responses. Since 2006, several proteins have been
   identified as possible ABA receptors. These are the nuclear
   flowering-time protein FCA, the plastid-associated Mg-protoporphyrin IX
   chelatase H subunit (CHLH/GUN5), a membrane-bound GCR2, and two novel
   G-protein coupled receptors GTG1 and GTG2. However, the results obtained
   in these studies are contested or questioned by several researchers, and
   in one case lately retracted. The situation improved with the
   publication of the recent studies indicating that receptors for this
   hormone are a group of small soluble proteins referred to as Pyrabactin
   Resistance 1 (PYR1), or PYR-like (PYL), encoded in Arabidopsis thaliana
   by fourteen genes. Proteins of this family were found to bind ABA and
   inhibit the activity of specific protein phosphatase enzymes, the type
   2C plant PP2Cs, which were previously implicated in the ABA responses.
   In the absence of ABA, the PP2Cs act as constitutive negative regulators
   of a family of protein kinases SnRK2s whose autophosphorylation is
   required for kinase activity towards downstream targets. When abscisic
   acid enters a plant cell, PYR1/PYL receptor forms a binary complex with
   hormone and then immediately binds to, and inhibits the PP2C. The
   inhibition of the negatively acting PP2Cs leads to the successful
   activation of SnRK2.2, SnRK2.3 and SnRK2.6, which phosphorylate the
   basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors called ABFs/AREBs
   inducing the expression of ABA-responsive genes. By determining the
   crystal structures of members of the receptor family, with and without
   bound abscisic acid and protein phosphatase, high-definition structural
   images of the receptor complex are now available. In the hormone-free
   form, the PYR1/PYL protein presents an open and accessible cavity with
   two flexible surface loops that guard the ABA-binding pocket. Binding of
   ABA to the receptor-protein initiates an allosteric transition of the
   gating loops that sequester ABA in the pocked. The protein phosphatase
   PP2C binds to the hydrophobic site on the gating loops, which interact
   closely with the active site of the phosphatase, blocking its ability to
   bind and dephosphorylate its substrate. A conserved tryptophan residue
   of the phosphatase inserts its side chain to the gating loops. In this
   respect, PP2C acts as a potent co-receptor to enhance the affinity of
   the hormone for its receptor.},

Abstract = {INrf2-Nrf2 proteins are sensors of chemical/radiation stress. Nrf2, in
   response to stresses, is released from INrf2. Nrf2 is translocated into
   the nucleus where it binds to the antioxidant response element and
   coordinately activates the expression of a battery of genes that protect
   cells against oxidative and electrophilic stress. An autoregulatory loop
   between INrf2 and Nrf2 regulates their cellular abundance. Nrf2
   activates INrf2 gene expression, and INrf2 serves as an adapter for
   degradation of Nrf2. In this report, we demonstrate that mutation of
   tyrosine 141 in bric-a-bric, tramtrack, broad complex domain to alanine
   rendered INrf2 unstable and nonfunctional. INrf2Y141A mutant degraded
   rapidly as compared with wild type INrf2, although it could dimerize and
   bind Nrf2. De novo synthesized INrf2 protein was phosphorylated at
   tyrosine 141. Tyrosine 141-phosphorylated INrf2 was highly stable.
   Treatment with hydrogen peroxide, which is an oxidizing agent, led to
   dephosphorylation of INrf2Y141, resulting in rapid degradation of INrf2.
   This resulted in stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of ARE-mediated
   gene expression. These results demonstrate that stress-induced
   dephosphorylation of tyrosine 141 is a novel mechanism in Nrf2
   activation and cellular protection.},

Abstract = {A retraction notice is an essential scientific historical document
   because it should outline the reason(s) why a scientific manuscript was
   retracted, culpability (if any) and any other factors that have given
   reason for the authors, editors, or publisher, to remove a piece of the
   literature from science's history books. Unlike an expression of concern
   (EoC), erratum or corrigendum, a retraction will usually result in a
   rudimentary vestige of the work. Thus, any retraction notice that does
   not fully indicate a set of elements related to the reason and
   background for the retraction serves as a poor historical document.
   Moreover, poorly or incompletely worded retraction notices in fact do
   not serve their intended purpose, i.e., to hold all parties accountable,
   and to inform the scientific and wider public of the problem and reason
   for the paper's demise. This paper takes a look at the definitions and
   the policies of clauses for retractions, EoCs, errata and corrigenda in
   place by 15 leading science, technology and medicine (STM) publishers
   and four publishing-related bodies that we believe have the greatest
   influence on the current fields of science, technology and medicine. The
   primary purpose was to assess whether there is a consistency among these
   entities and publishers. Using an arbitrary 5-scale classification
   system, and evaluating the different categories of policies separately,
   we discovered that in almost all cases (88.9 \%), the wording used to
   define these four categories of polices differs from that of the
   Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), which is generally considered to
   be the guiding set of definitions in science publishing. In addition, as
   much as 61 \% deviation in policies (wording and meaning), relative to
   COPE guidelines, was discovered. When considering the average pooled
   deviation across all categories of policies, we discovered that there
   was either no deviation or a small deviation, only in the wording, in
   the definition of policies when compared to the COPE guidelines in 1 out
   of 3 ethical bodies, and in 40 \% (6 out of 15) STM publishers. Moderate
   deviation from the COPE guidelines was detected in 26.7 \% of STM
   publishers and one ethical body but a large deviation in one ethical
   body and 20 \% of STM publishers was observed. Two STM publishers (13.3
   \%) did not report any information about these policies. Even though in
   practice, editors and publishers may deviate from these written
   definitions when dealing with case-by-case issues, we believe that it is
   essential, to serve as a consistent guide for authors and editors, that
   the wording be standardized across these entities. COPE and these
   entities also have the responsibility of making it clear that these
   definitions are merely suggestions and that their application may be
   subjected to subjective interpretation and application.},

Abstract = {The main pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is the structural
   alteration in the neurovascular unit, coinciding with neurovascular
   matrix degradation. Resveratrol has been,reported to be one of the most
   potent chemopreventive agents that can inhibit cellular processes
   associated with ischemic stroke. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has
   been considered as a potential drug target for the treatment of cerebral
   ischiemia. To explore this, we tried to investigate the interaction of
   resveratrol with MMPs through molecular docking studies. At 30 minutes
   before and 2 hours after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced by
   occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, 40 mg/kg resveratrol was
   intraperitoneally administered. After resveratrol administration,
   neurological function and brain edema were significantly alleviated,
   cerebral infarct volume was significantly reduced, and nitrite and
   malondialdehyde levels in the cortical and striatal regions were
   significantly decreased. The molecular docking study of resveratrol and
   MMPs revealed that resveratrol occupied the active site of MMP-2 and
   MMP-9. The binding energy of the complexes was 37.848672 kJ/mol and
   36.6345 kJ/mol for MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively. In case of MMP-2, Leu
   164, Ala 165 and Thr 227 were engaged in H-Bonding with resveratrol and
   in case of MMP-9, H-bonding was found with Glu 402, Ala 417 and Arg 424
   residues. These findings collectively reveal that resveratrol exhibits
   neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia through inhibiting MMP-2
   and MMP-9 activity.},

Abstract = {The study evaluated the ability of long intergenic noncoding RNA
   LINC00312 (LINC00312) to influence the proliferation, invasion, and
   migration of thyroid cancer (TC) cells by regulating miRNA-197-3p. TC
   tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 211 TC patients.
   K1 (papillary TC), SW579 (squamous TC), and 8505C (anaplastic TC) cell
   lines were assigned into a blank, negative control (NC), LINC00312
   overexpression, miR-197-3p inhibitors, and LINC00312 overexpression +
   miR-197-3p mimics group. The expression of LINC00312, miR-197-3p, and
   p120 were measured using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and
   Western blotting. Cell proliferation was assessed via CCK8 assay, cell
   invasion through the scratch test, and cell migration via Transwell
   assay. In comparison with adjacent normal tissues, the expression of
   LINC00312 is down-regulated and the expression of miR-197-3p is
   up-regulated in TC tissues. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay
   confirmed that P120 is a target of miR-197-3p. The expression of
   LINC00312 and p120 was higher in the LINC00312 overexpression group than
   in the blank and NV groups. However, the expression of miR-197-3p was
   lower in the LINC00312 overexpression group than in the blank and NC
   groups. The miR-197-3p inhibitors group had a higher expression of
   miR-197-3p, but a lower expression of p120 than the blank and NC groups.
   The LINC00312 overexpression and miR-197-3p inhibitor groups had reduced
   cell proliferation, invasion and migration than the blank and NC groups.
   These results indicate that a LINC00312 overexpression inhibits the
   proliferation, invasion, and migration of TC cells and that this can be
   achieved by down-regulating miR-197-3p.},

Abstract = {Background/Aims: The present study aimed to detect the expression of
   miR-449a and investigate the effect of miR-449a on cell injury in
   cardiomyocytes subjected to hypoxia/ reoxygenation (H/R) and its
   underlying mechanisms. Methods: The expression of miR-449a was
   determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in both
   neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and H9C2 cells. For gain-of-function
   and loss-of-function studies, H9C2 cells were transfected with either
   miR-449a mimics or miR-449a inhibitor. The target gene of miR-449a was
   confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by
   both flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide and
   transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling
   (TUNEL). Necrosis was confirmed by the detection of lactate
   dehydrogenase release. The cell viability was measured using the
   methylthiotetrazole method. The protein levels of Notch-1, Notch-1
   intracellular domain, hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes-1), and
   apoptosis-related genes were measured by Western blot analysis. Results:
   MiR-449a was significantly upregulated in both neonatal rat ventricular
   myocytes and H9C2 cells subjected to H/R. However, H/R-induced cell
   apoptosis and necrosis were markedly reduced by miR-449a inhibition. By
   targeting Notch-1, miR-449a regulated the Notch-1/ Hes-1 signaling
   pathway. The blockade of the Notch signaling pathway partly abolished
   the protective effect of miR-449a suppression against H/R injury,
   whereas the overexpression of Notch-1 intracellular domain partly
   reversed the effect of miR-449a overexpression on H/R-induced cell
   injury. Conclusions: The present study suggested that miR-449a
   inhibition protected H9C2 cells against H/R-induced cell injury by
   targeting the Notch-1 signaling pathway, providing a novel insight into
   the molecular basis of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury and a
   potential therapeutic target. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

Abstract = {The amino acid sequences of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the type II
   DNA topoisomerases are divergent and species specific as compared with
   the highly conserved N-terminal and central domains. A set of C-terminal
   deletion mutants of Leishmania donovani topoisomerase II was
   constructed. Removal of more than 178 amino acids out of 1236 amino acid
   residues from the C-terminus inactivates the enzyme, whereas removal of
   118 amino acids or less has no apparent effect on the ability of the
   parasite enzyme to complement a temperature-sensitive mutation of the
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae topoisomerase II gene. Deletion analysis
   revealed a potent nuclear localization signal ( NLS) within the amino
   acid residues 998 - 1058. Immunomicroscopy results suggest that the
   removal of an NLS in the CTD is likely to contribute to the
   physiological dysfunction of these proteins. Modeling of the LdTOP2
   based on the crystal structure of the yeast type II DNA topoisomerase
   showed that the parasite protein assumes a structure similar to its
   yeast counterpart harboring all the conserved residues in a structurally
   similar position. However, a marked difference in electrostatic
   potential was found in a span of 60 amino acid residues ( 998 - 1058),
   which also do not have any homology with topoisomerase II sequences.
   Such significant differences can be exploited by the structure-based
   design of selective inhibitors using the structure of the Leishmania
   enzyme as a template.},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) to individual
   patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD; defined as
   estimated glomerular filtration rate of <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) who
   receive a group II gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) is not well
   understood or summarized in the literature. Objective To assess the
   pooled risk of NSF in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD receiving a group
   II GBCA. Data Sources A health sciences informationist searched the Ovid
   (MEDLINE and MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process \& Other
   Non-Indexed Citation, and Daily and Versions), Embase, Cochrane Central
   Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Open Grey databases
   from inception to January 29, 2019, yielding 2700 citations. Study
   Selection Citations were screened for inclusion in a multistep process.
   Agreement for final cohort inclusion was determined by 2 blinded
   screeners using Cohen kappa. Inclusion criteria consisted of stage 4 or
   5 CKD with or without dialysis, administration of an unconfounded
   American College of Radiology classification group II GBCA (gadobenate
   dimeglumine, gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, or gadoteridol), and
   incident NSF as an outcome. Conference abstracts, retracted manuscripts,
   narrative reviews, editorials, case reports, and manuscripts not
   reporting total group II GBCA administrations were excluded. Data
   Extraction and Synthesis Data extraction was performed for all studies
   by a single investigator, including publication details, study design
   and time frame, patient characteristics, group II GBCA(s) administered,
   total exposures for patients with stage 4 or stage 5 CKD, total cases of
   unconfounded NSF, reason for GBCA administration, follow-up duration,
   loss to follow-up, basis for NSF screening, and diagnosis. Main Outcomes
   and Measures Pooled incidence of NSF and the associated upper bound of a
   2-sided 95\% CI (risk estimate) for the pooled data and each of the 4
   group II GBCAs. Results Sixteen unique studies with 4931 patients were
   included (kappa = 0.68) in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The
   pooled incidence of NSF was 0 of 4931 (0\%; upper bound of 95\% CI,
   0.07\%). The upper bound varied owing to different sample sizes for
   gadobenate dimeglumine (0 of 3167; upper bound of 95\% CI, 0.12\%),
   gadoterate meglumine (0 of 1204; upper bound of 95\% CI, 0.31\%),
   gadobutrol (0 of 330; upper bound of 95\% CI, 1.11\%), and gadoteridol
   (0 of 230; upper bound of 95\% CI, 1.59\%). Conclusions and Relevance
   This study's findings suggest that the risk of NSF from group II GBCA
   administration in stage 4 or 5 CKD is likely less than 0.07\%. The
   potential diagnostic harms of withholding group II GBCA for indicated
   examinations may outweigh the risk of NSF in this population.},

Abstract = {Blood-derived monocytes are found at sites of inflammation as well as in
   solid tumors and atherosclerotic arteries. They are an abundant source
   of inflammatory eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) and
   thromboxane A(2), which are formed via arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism
   by cyclooxygenase-1/2 (COX-1/2). In vitro studies of inflammatory
   mediator production are conducted invariably in room air, which does not
   reflect the oxygen tensions found in monocyte-containing lesions, which
   are frequently hypoxic. In this work we examined the effects of hypoxia
   at levels reported in these lesions, on monocyte COX-2 expression, the
   related events that lead to eicosanoid synthesis, and relationships with
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha synthesis. In fresh human monocytes
   exposed to hypoxia (1\% O-2), there was an increase in COX-2 protein
   compared with cells in normoxia, and this was attributable to increased
   transcription and mRNA stability. However, the synthesis of PGE(2) and
   thromboxane A(2) was reduced in hypoxia and did not reflect the
   increased level of COX-2. Monocytes prelabeled with {[}H-3] AA followed
   by lipopolysaccharide stimulation in the presence of hypoxia showed a
   reduced release of AA compared with cells in normoxia. In addition,
   hypoxia resulted in decreased phosphorylation of the p44/42
   mitogen-activated protein kinase and of cytosolic phospholipase A(2).
   Hypoxia also increased TNF-alpha synthesis, which appeared to play a
   role in COX-2 expression, and the observed increase TNF-alpha synthesis
   appeared to result from reduced PGE(2) synthesis. Overall, the results
   suggest the existence of an autocrine loop of regulation between
   monocyte eicosanoid and TNF-alpha production, which is dysregulated in
   hypoxia and establishes hypoxia as being an important environmental
   determinant of inflammatory mediator production.},

Abstract = {Shikonin has been testified to wield the anti-tumor action in multiple
   cancers. But, the clout of Shikonin for gastric cancer (GC) is still
   inconclusive. The contemplation of this research undertook to disclose
   the impacts of Shikonin on GC progress meanwhile to uncover the
   conceivable mechanism. NCI-N87 cells were disposed by Shikonin at
   diverse concentration points. The trials of CCK-8, colony formation,
   flow cytometry and Transwell assays were executed for detecting the
   functions of Shikonin in NCI-N87 cells. The impacts of miR-195 on
   Shikonin-regulated PI3K/AKT pathway were estimated via western blot. The
   in vivo trial was detected by xenografts model assay. We found that
   Shikonin suppressed cell survival and triggered apoptosis in NCI-N87
   cells. Additionally, Shikonin restrained cell migration, invasion and
   down-regulated MMP2, RhoA, ROCK1 and Vimentin expression in NCI-N87
   cells. Furthermore, Shikonin notably inhibited PI3K/AKT signal pathway,
   but the restraining functions were repealed by miR-195 inhibition in
   NCI-N87 cells. The in vivo trial results revealed that Shikonin
   determinately impeded tumor formation. In conclusion, these results
   demonstrated that Shikonin prohibited NCI-N87 cells proliferation,
   migration, invasion, and accelerated apoptosis by inactivation of
   PI3K/AKT pathway. The findings maybe provide a fresh opinion for healing

Abstract = {Background: Vitamin D might be beneficial in diabetic patients with
   coronary artery disease (CAD) through its favorable effects on metabolic
   profiles and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress.
   Objective: This study was performed to examine the effects of 60 of
   vitamin D supplementation on metabolic status in diabetic patients with
   CAD.
   Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
   trial was conducted in 60 vitamin D-deficient diabetic patients with CAD
   aged 40-85 y. Subjects were randomly assigned into 2 groups to take
   either 50,000-IU vitamin D supplements (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30)
   every 2 wk for+/-mo. Fasting blood samples were obtained at the
   beginning of the study and after the 6-mo intervention to quantify
   glycemic indicators, lipid concentrations, and biomarkers of
   inflammation and oxidative stress.
   Results: Compared with placebo, vitamin D supplementation resulted in
   significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose (214.9+/-7.1 compared
   with + 19.3+/-7.1 mg/dL; P = 0.001), serum insulin (22.7+/-1.1 compared
   with + 1.8+/-1.1 mIU/mL; P = 0.006), homeostasis model assessment of
   insulin resistance (20.76 0.3 comparedwith + 0.56 0.3; P = 0.01), and b
   cell function (29.164.2 comparedwith + 5.764.2; P = 0.01) and a
   significant increase in serumvitamin D (+ 6.860.9 compared with +
   0.1+/-0.9 ng/mL; P < 0.001) and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity
   Check Index (+ 0.008+/-0.004 compared with 20.007+/-0.004; P = 0.01). In
   addition, changes in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP;
   21.0+/-0.5 compared with + 0.66 0.5 mg/mL; P = 0.02), plasma nitric
   oxide (NO; + 7.06 2.0 comparedwith24.66 2.0 mmol/L; P < 0.001), total
   reduced glutathione (GSH; + 104+/-16.4 compared with + 24.8+/-16.4

   compared with + 0.2+/-0.1 mmol/L; P < 0.001) in the supplemented group
   were significantly different fromthe changes in these indicators in the
   placebo group.
   Conclusions: Overall, 6mo of vitamin D supplementation among vitamin
   D-deficient diabetic patients with CAD had beneficial effects on
   glycemic control and serum hs-CRP, NO, GSH, and malondialdehyde
   concentrations. This trial was registered on the Iranian website (www.

Abstract = {Purpose: A retrospective study based on a conventional medical practice
   was performed to evaluate the outcome of alendronate treatment for four
   years in Japanese men with osteoporosis or osteopenia and clinical risk
   factors for fractures.
   Methods: Twenty-nine Japanese men with osteoporosis or osteopenia and
   clinical risk factors for fractures (mean age at baseline 61.0 years)
   who had been treated with alendronate for over four years in our
   outpatient clinic were studied. Lumbar spine or total hip bone mineral
   density (BMD) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and
   urinary levels of cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I
   collagen (NTX) and serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase
   were monitored during the four-year treatment period.
   Results: Urinary NTX and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels
   decreased (-44.4\% at three months and -61.2\% at four years,
   respectively) and lumbar spine and total hip BMD increased (+13.9\% and
   +9.2\% at four years, respectively), compared with baseline values. No
   serious adverse events were observed, including osteonecrosis of the
   jaw, femoral diaphysis atypical fractures, or atrial fibrillation.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the outcome of
   alendronate treatment for four years in Japanese men with an increased
   risk for fractures. Alendronate suppressed bone turnover and increased
   lumbar spine and total hip BMD from baseline over the course of the
   four-year treatment period without causing any severe adverse events in
   Japanese men with osteoporosis or osteopenia and clinical risk factors
   for fractures.},

Abstract = {Di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), as the
   novel iron chelator, has been reported to inhibit the tumorigenesis and
   progression of various cancer cells. However, whether Dp44mT has
   anticancer effects in colon cancer cells is still unknown. Here, we
   investigated the antitumor action of Dp44mT in colon cancer and its
   underlying mechanisms, and the connections between Dp44mT and N-myc
   downstream-regulated genes 1(Ndrg1). We used cell viability, migration
   and invasion assay, flow cytometry, western blot and qRT-PCR to examine
   the anticancer effects of Dp44mT and Ndrg1. We found that Dp44mT
   suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis of
   colon cancer cells and over-expression of Ndrg1 also suppressed cell
   viability, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis of colon cancer
   cells. Dp44mT attenuated the TGF-beta 1-induced EMT in colon cancer
   cells, and Dp44mT could up-regulate Ndrg1 expression level.
   Overexpression of Ndrg1 attenuates the TGF-beta 1-induced EMT, Dp44mT
   and Ndrg1 suppressed EMT through activation of Wnt/beta catenin
   signaling pathway. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that
   Dp44mT/Ndrg1 have effective anticancer capability in colon cancer cells
   and that may represent a promising treatment strategy for human colon
   cancer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the present study, hsa-miR-424-5p mimic plasmid and hsa-mir-424-5p
   inhibitor plasmid were designed and injected into rats respectively, and
   miRNA control plasmid was also constructed. Models of Type 1 diabetes
   (T1D) were built. After successful modeling, the expression of
   hsa-miR-424-5p in lymphocytes was analyzed by RT-PCR. The expression of
   protein PD-1, T-bet, CXCR3, STING in Th1 lymphocytes and content of
   IGF-1 in islet tissue were analyzed by flow analysis. The protein levels
   of SHP2, Rheb, mTORC1, Rictor and Raptor in islet tissue were analyzed
   by Western blot. The results showed that hsa-miR-424-5p mimic group had
   the highest expression of hsa-miR-424-5p in lymphocytes. The expression
   of PD-1 was in hsa-miR-424-5p inhibitor > miRNA control > hsa-miR-424-5p
   mimic, while the expression of T-bet, CXCR3 and STING was in
   hsa-miR-424-5p mimic > miRNA control > hsa-miR-424-5p inhibitor. The
   expression of IGF-1 protein in hsa-miR-424-5p inhibitor group was the
   highest (32.08\%) and hardly expressed in hsa-miR-424-5p mimic group
   (2.36\%). The expression of SHP2, Rheb, mTORC1, Rictor and Raptor of
   insulin histoproteins were in hsa-miR-424-5p mimic group > miRNA control
   of > hsa-miR-424-5p inhibitor group, with statistical differences. It
   indicates that hsa-miR-424-5p binding PD-1 signaling molecules can
   stimulate the immune effect through the mTORC signaling pathway and
   participates in the pathogenesis of T1D.},

Abstract = {Monodisperse CuB23 nanoparticles were successfully grown on graphene by
   the co-reduction of graphene oxide and Cu(NH3)(4)(2+) using KBH4 and
   with the assistance of solution plasma. Graphene is a powerful
   dispersion agent and a distinct support for CuB23 nanoparticles.
   Unexpectedly, we found that the prepared CuB23/graphene catalyst imparts
   exceedingly high activity to the Heck-type coupling of unactivated alkyl
   halides with alkenes and the liquid phase hydrogenation of levulinic
   acid to.-valerolactone. Additionally, the as-prepared CuB23/graphene
   also exhibited excellent recyclability during the hydrogenation of
   levulinic acid. The excellent catalytic performance might be caused by
   the combined effect of the good dispersion of CuB23 nanoparticles and
   the interaction between graphene and CuB23 nanoparticles. This not only
   facilitates electron transfer and mass transport but also improves
   thermal stability during the catalytic reaction process.},

Abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability
   around the world. Angiogenesis is supposed to protect brain
   microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) from oxidative and ischemic
   stress. Previous studies indicated that interaction between
   metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and
   miR-145 was involved in myocardial ischemia reperfusion, suggesting
   MALAT1 and miR-145 were also mediated with the progress of angiogenesis
   and cell migration in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced BMECs.
   The present study aimed to investigate the functional roles of MALAT1 in
   regulating miR-145 and its downstream pro-angiogenesis factors, vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) during
   the progress of angiogenesis in OGD-induced BMECs. An in vitro OGD model
   was employed in mouse BMECs to mimic brain hypoxic and ischemic
   conditions; MTT was used to determine cell viability. qRT-PCR was used
   to determine the expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-MALAT1 and
   miR-145 under OGD conditions; in vitro tube formation assay was used to
   investigate angiogenic effect of MALAT1 and miR-145. The relationship
   between lncRNA-MALAT1/miR-145 and miR-145/VEGF-A/ANGPT2 was evaluated by
   qRT-PCR and Western blot, and direct binding was assessed using dual
   luciferase assay. Results showed that the levels of lncRNA-MALAT1 and
   miR-145 were up-regulated in OGD-induced BMECs. miR-145 functioned as an
   anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic factor in OGD treated BMECs via
   down-regulating VEGF-A and ANGPT2 directly. While lncRNA-MALAT1 enhanced
   the expressions of VEGF-A and ANGPT2 by targetting miR-145 to promote
   angiogenesis and proliferation of BMECs under OGD conditions. Our
   present study revealed the inhibitory functions of miR-145 on
   angiogenesis through direct targetting on VEGF-A and ANGPT2 for the
   first time and proved the protective role of lncRNA-MALAT1 for BMECs
   under OGD conditions through the direct regulation of miR-145.},

Abstract = {We planned to dig the carcinostasis activity of physcion
   8-O-beta-glucopyranoside (PG) in ovarian cancer cells and explored
   whether long non-coding RNA NORAD was the potential cause of the
   carcinostasis impact of PG. The impacts of PG on the tumour cell
   behaviours (including cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion)
   of SKOV3 cells were grabbed. The levels of NORAD in cancer tissues and
   cell lines were determined; afterwards, the impacts of abnormal
   expression of NORAD on the tumour cell behaviours of SKOV3 cells were
   assessed. Moreover, we explored whether NORAD modulated the level of
   STAT3 by competitively sponging miR-608, thus mediating the
   antineoplastic effects of PG on ovarian cancer cells. PG suppressed cell
   viability, enhanced apoptosis and lessened migration and invasion of
   SKOV3 cells. NORAD was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cells.
   Silencing of NORAD lessened cell viability, migration and invasion, but
   induced apoptosis of SKOV3 cells, whereas overexpression of NORAD had
   opposite effects. Moreover, PG decreased the expression of NORAD.
   Overexpression of NORAD reversed the effects of PG treatment on the cell
   biological performances of SKOV3 cells, which were further reversed
   after overexpression of miR-608 simultaneously. Furthermore, STAT3 was
   tested as a target gene of miR-608, and the impact of NORAD in
   PG-treated SKOV3 cells were through the miR-608-mediated STAT3. Our
   findings reveal that NORAD/miR-608/STAT3 axis is pivotal in mediating
   the antineoplastic impacts of PG on ovarian cancer cells, which may
   offer a novel explanation in the therapy of ovarian cancer.},

Abstract = {Unfavorable metabolic profiles and oxidative stress in pregnancy are
   associated with several complications. This study was conducted to
   determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum
   concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),
   metabolic profiles, and biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy
   pregnant women. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
   clinical trial was conducted in 48 pregnant women aged 18-40 y old at 25
   wk of gestation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either
   400 IU/d cholecalciferol supplements (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 9
   wk. Fasting blood samples were taken at study baseline and after 9 wk of
   intervention to quantify serum concentrations of hs-CRP, lipid
   concentrations, insulin, and biomarkers of oxidative stress. After 9 wk
   of intervention, the increases in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium
   concentrations were greater in the vitamin D group (+3.7 mu g/L and
   +0.20 mg/dL, respectively) than in the placebo group (-1.2 mu g/L and
   -0.12 mg/dL, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Vitamin D
   supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in serum hs-CRP
   (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -1.41 vs. +1.50 mu g/mL; P-interaction =
   0.01) and insulin concentrations (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -1.0 vs.
   +2.6 mu lU/mL; P-interaction = 0.04) and a significant increase in the
   Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index score (vitamin D vs.
   placebo groups: +0.02 vs. -0.02; P-interaction = 0.006), plasma total
   antioxidant capacity (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: +152 vs. -20 mmol/L;
   P-interaction = 0.002), and total glutathione concentrations (vitamin D
   vs. placebo groups: +205 vs. -32 mu mol/L; P-interaction = 0.02)
   compared with placebo. Intake of vitamin D supplements led to a
   significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (vitamin D vs. placebo
   groups: -0.65 vs. -0.12 mmol/L; P-interaction = 0.01), systolic blood
   pressure (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -0.2 vs. +5.5 mm Hg;
   P-interaction = 0.01), and diastolic blood pressure (vitamin D vs.
   placebo groups: -0.4 vs. +3.1 mm Hg; P-interaction = 0.01) compared with
   placebo. In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation for 9 wk among
   pregnant women has beneficial effects on metabolic status.},

Title = {Sex Differences in Academic Productivity Across Academic Ranks and
   Specialties in Academic Medicine A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE Despite equal numbers of men and women entering medical
   school, women are underrepresented in the upper echelons of academic
   medicine and receive less compensation and research funding.
   Citation-related publication productivity metrics, such as the h-index,
   are increasingly used for hiring, salary, grants, retention, promotion,
   and tenure decisions. Exploring sex differences in these metrics across
   academic medicine provides deeper insight into why differences are
   observed in career outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically examine the available literature on sex
   differences in h-index of academic faculty physicians across all medical
   specialties and all levels of academic rank.
   DATA SOURCES Medical literature with the term h-index found in PubMed
   and published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, was used.
   STUDY SELECTION A PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and
   Outcomes), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-analyses), and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in
   Epidemiology) selection protocol was used to find observational studies
   that published h-indexes for faculty physicians that were stratified by
   sex. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, retracted, or
   unavailable online. Ultimately, 14 of 786 studies (1.78\%) met the
   inclusion criteria.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data from 9 studies across 16 specialties
   were examined using weighted random-effects meta-analyses. Five studies
   were excluded because of overlapping specialties with another study or
   because they were missing appropriate statistics for the meta-analysis.
   Four of these studies were included in qualitative synthesis to bring
   the total to 13 studies.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was the h-index.
   RESULTS The meta-analysis included 10 665 North American unique academic
   physicians across 9 different studies from the years 2009 to 2018. Of
   the 10 665 physicians, 2655 (24.89\%) were women. Summary effect sizes
   for mean h-indexes of men and women and mean h-index difference between
   men and women were determined for all faculty physicians and at each
   academic rank. Overall, female faculty had lower h-indexes than male
   faculty (mean difference, -4.09; 95\% CI, -5.44 to -2.73; P < .001).
   When adjusting for academic rank, female faculty still had lower
   h-indexes than male faculty at the ranks of assistant professor (mean
   difference, -1.3; 95\% CI, -1.90 to -0.72; P < .001), associate
   professor (mean difference, -2.09; 95\% CI, -3.40 to -0.78; P = .002),
   and professor (mean difference, -3.41; 95\% CI, -6.24 to -0.58; P =
   .02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-analysis,
   women had lower h-indexes than men across most specialties and at all
   academic ranks, but it is unclear why these differences exist. These
   findings suggest that future investigation should be conducted regarding
   the causes of lower h-indexes in women and that interventions should be
   developed to provide a more equitable environment for all physicians
   regardless of sex.},

Abstract = {O-Doped BN nanosheets with a thickness of 1.033 nm were prepared via the
   direct reaction of CuB23 with NOCl at room temperature in ionic liquids.
   It had a large high specific surface area of 858 m(2) g(-1), and showed
   a high electrical conductivity of 34.3 S m(-1) and a good specific
   capacity of 187 F g(-1). Meanwhile, the obtained sample demonstrated
   excellent performance as the electrode material for capacitive
   deionization (CDI) to remove Cd2+ from water in a wide range of
   concentrations from 0.05 to 600 ppm with a maximum adsorption capacity
   of 2281 mg g(-1). It is attributed to its unique structural
   characteristics and the ability of its NO-groups to coordinate Cd2+
   which promotes the electrosorption. More importantly, it exhibited
   outstanding capability for the total, rapid, and simultaneous removal of
   multiple metal ions (Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Ca2+,
   Fe2+, Fe3+ and Na+) by CDI within 20 min. These results suggest
   promising applications of our BNO nanosheets for water purification and

Abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in
   post-menopausal women. Estrogen synthesis is catalyzed by aromatase,
   which is encoded by CYP19. We previously showed that aromatase
   expression and activity are increased in the breast tissue of overweight
   and obese women in the presence of characteristic inflammatory foci
   {[}crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B)]. In preclinical studies,
   proinflammatory prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) is a determinant of aromatase
   expression. We provide evidence that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-derived
   PGE(2) stimulates the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-> PKA signal transduction
   pathway that activates CYP19 transcription, resulting in increased
   aromatase expression and elevated progesterone receptor levels in breast
   tissues from overweight and obese women. We further demonstrate that a
   measure of in-breast inflammation (CLS-B index) is a better correlate of
   these biologic end points than body mass index. The obesity ->
   inflammation -> aromatase axis is likely to contribute to the increased
   risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and the worse prognosis
   of obese patients with breast cancer.
   SIGNIFICANCE: We show that obesity-associated inflammatory foci in the
   human breast are associated with elevated COX-2 levels and activation of
   the PGE(2)-> cAMP -> PKA signal transduction pathway resulting in
   increased aromatase expression. These findings help to explain the link
   among obesity, low-grade chronic inflammation, and breast cancer with
   important clinical implications. Cancer Discov; 2(4); 356-65. (c) 2012

Abstract = {Importance: Recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction and hypoparathyroidism
   are well-recognized, important complications of thyroid surgery. The
   duration of convalescence after noncomplicated thyroid operation may
   depend on several factors, of which pain and fatigue are the most
   important. Nausea and vomiting occur mainly on the day of operation.
   Glucocorticoids are well known for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory,
   immune-modulating and antiemetic effects. However, there is little
   information in the literature on the use of steroids in thyroid surgery,
   and the information that is available is conflicting.
   Objective: To investigate whether preoperative dexamethasone could
   improve surgical outcome in patients undergoing thyroid surgery.
   Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. A 30-day
   follow-up for morbidity was performed in all cases.
   Setting: All patients were hospitalized in a public hospital.
   Participants: From June 2008 through August 2011, 328 patients were
   randomized to receive either intravenous dexamethasone, 8 mg,
   administered 90 minutes before skin incision, or saline solution
   (placebo).
   Interventions: Intravenous dexamethasone, 8 mg.
   Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end points were temporary or
   permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Transient and definitive
   hypoparathy-roidism, pain and fatigue scores, nausea, and the number of
   vomiting episodes were also registered. Preoperatively and at several
   times during the first 24 postoperative hours, we measured C-reactive
   protein, interleukin 6, and interleukin 1 beta levels.
   Results: In the dexamethasone group, the rate of temporary recurrent
   laryngeal nerve palsy (4.9\%) was significantly lower compared with the
   placebo group (8.4\%) (P=.04). Also, postoperative transient biochemical
   hypoparathyroidism occurred more frequently in the placebo group
   (37.0\%) than in the dexamethasone group (12.8\%). Dexamethasone use
   significantly reduced postoperative levels of C-reactive protein (P=.01)
   and interleukin 6 and interleukin 1 beta (P=.02), fatigue (P=.01), and
   overall pain during the first 24 postoperative hours (P=.04), as well as
   the total analgesic (ketorolac tromethamine) requirement (P=.04).
   Dexamethasone use also reduced nausea and vomiting on the day of
   operation (P=.045).
   Conclusions and Relevance: Preoperative administration of dexamethasone,
   8 mg, reduced postoperative temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy
   and hypoparathyroidism rates and reduced pain, fatigue, nausea, and
   vomiting after thyroid surgery. However, these data require further
   analysis in randomized prospective studies.},

Abstract = {A facile, reliable, and robust synthetic method for the preparation of
   monodisperse Ni3Fe single-crystalline nanospheres with 182.3 m(2) g(-1)
   specific surface area is reported. The results of an investigation of
   the shape/size distribution, structural characteristics, and composition
   of these Ni3Fe nanospheres are presented, and a possible mechanism for
   the formation of the nanospheres at high temperatures in a
   cetylamine-palmitic acid solution in the presence of tri-iso-butyl
   thallium and borane trimethylamine complexes is proposed. During the
   decomposition of hydrazine, when supported on carbon (Ni3Fe/C), the
   monodisperse Ni3Fe nanospheres exerted 100\% H-2 selectivity, and showed
   exceedingly high activity at room temperature. The decomposition
   reaction is first-order in Ni3Fe concentration, but zero-order in N2H4
   concentration; the activation energy was 48.1 +/- 2.0 kJ mol(-1).
   Furthermore, the Ni3Fe/C was a stable catalyst for N2H4 hydrolytic
   dehydrogenation; it provided 15 840 total turnovers in 30 h. An Ni3Fe
   nanosphere-based catalyst such as this that is efficient under mild
   reaction conditions represents a promising step toward the practical
   development of N2H4 as a feasible hydrogen storage medium for fuel cell
   applications.},

Abstract = {Background: Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD2) is an oxygen
   sensor that is able to induce hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha)
   degradation under normoxic condition. The present paper designed to
   reveal the function of PHD2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells
   proliferation, migration and invasion.
   Methods: qRT-PCR and Western blot were carried out to see the expression
   of PHD2 in HCC tissues and cell lines. PHD2 expression in Huh7 and
   HepG3B cells was overexpressed or suppressed by transfection and then
   the changes of cell proliferation, migration and invasion were detected
   by CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and Western blot.
   Results: PHD2 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines (Huh7,
   Hep3B, SK-HEP-1, HCCLM3 and MHCC97) as relative to para-cancerous
   non-tumour tissues and a normal hepatocyte line MIHA. PHD2
   overexpression promoted Huh7 and Hep3B cells viability, migration and
   invasion. Meanwhile, CyclinD1, c-Myc, MMP-2, MMP-9 and Vimentin were
   up-regulated, while p53 was down-regulated by PHD2 overexpression. PHD2
   silence led to a contrary impact. Further, PHD2 overexpression
   up-regulated Ras and Raf expression and induced phosphorylation of MEK,
   ERK, JAK1 and STAT3.
   Conclusion: PHD2 exhibited pro-tumour functions in HCC cells. PHD2
   promoted HCC possibly through Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3 pathways.
   HIGHLIGHTS
   1. PHD2 is highly expressed in HCC tissue and cell lines;
   2. PHD2 promotes the proliferation of Huh7 and HepG3B cells;
   3. PHD2 enhances Huh7 and HepG3B cells migration and invasion;
   4. PHD2 activates Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK1/STAT3 signalling.},

Abstract = {ORF57 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus has a
   counterpart in all herpesvirus of mammals and birds and regulates gene
   expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. ORF57 was
   capable of self-interaction and bound a rapidly migrating form of
   heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a multifunctional
   cellular protein involved in gene expression. In virus infected cell
   extracts, ORF57 was present in a complex with hnRNP K that had protein
   kinase CK2 activity, and was phosphorylated by CK2. Different regions of
   ORF57 bound both catalytic alpha/alpha' and regulatory beta subunits of
   CK2. CK2 modification enhanced the ORF57-hnRNP K interaction, and may
   regulate the presence and activities of components in the complex. We
   suggest that ORF57 and hnRNP K interaction may modulate ORF57-mediated
   regulation of viral gene expression. Herpesviral ORF57 (Rhadinovirus)
   and ICP27 (Simplexvirus) proteins both interact with hnRNP K and CK2
   implying that adaptation of the ancestral hnRNP K and CK2 to associate
   with viral regulatory ancestor protein likely pre-dates divergence of
   these Herpesviridae genera that occurred 200 million years ago.},

Abstract = {Background: To our knowledge, there is no study that has examined the
   effects of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic status in gestational
   diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   Objective: This study was designed to assess the effects of vitamin D
   supplementation on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive
   protein, and biomarkers of oxidative stress in pregnant women with GDM.
   Design: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
   was conducted in 54 women with GDM. Subjects were randomly assigned to
   receive either vitamin D supplements or placebo. Individuals in the
   vitamin D group (n = 27) received capsules containing 50,000 IU vitamin
   D-3 2 times during the study (at baseline and at day 21 of the
   intervention) and those in the placebo group (n = 27) received 2
   placebos at the same times. Fasting blood samples were collected at
   baseline and after 6 wk of the intervention to quantify relevant
   variables.
   Results: Cholecalciferol supplementation resulted in increased serum
   25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations compared with placebo (+18.5 +/- 20.4
   compared with +0.5 +/- 6.1 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Furthermore, intake of
   vitamin D supplements led to a significant decrease in concentrations of
   fasting plasma glucose (-17.1 +/- 14.8 compared with -0.9 +/- 16.6
   mg/dL; P < 0.001) and serum insulin (-3.08 +/- 6.62 compared with +1.34
   +/- 6.51 mu IU/mL; P = 0.01) and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin
   resistance (-1.28 +/- 1.41 compared with +0.34 +/- 1.79; P < 0.001) and
   a significant increase in the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check
   Index (+0.03 +/- 0.03 compared with -0.001 +/- 0.02; P = 0.003) compared
   with placebo. A significant reduction in concentrations of total (-11.0
   +/- 23.5 compared with +9.5 +/- 36.5 mg/dL; P = 0.01) and low-density.
   lipoprotein (LDL) (-10.8 +/- 22.4 compared with +10.4 +/- 28.0 mg/dL; P
   = 0.003) cholesterol was also seen after vitamin D supplementation.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with GDM had
   beneficial effects on glycemia and total and LDL-cholesterol
   concentrations but did not affect inflammation and oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {Colon cancer, also known as colorectal carcinoma (CRC), remains to be
   one of the most mainsprings of cancer-produced deaths entire world. We
   planned to grab the role and possible biological cause of a long
   noncoding RNA, namely, small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15), in
   CRC. The mRNA level of SNHG15 in CRC tissues and cells was detected,
   followed by investigating the impacts of the depression of SNHG15 on CRC
   cell proliferation (viability and colony-forming), apoptosis, migration,
   and invasion. Moreover, the association between SNHG15 and miR-141 and
   the correlation between miR-141 and SIRT1 were also explored. Besides,
   the influences of dysregulated SNHG15 on the Wnt/beta-catenin
   signal-related proteins were determined. SNHG15 was highly expressed in
   CRC tissues and cells. Depression of SNHG15 depressed proliferation,
   enhanced apoptosis, and repressed the migration and invasion of CRC
   cells. In addition, SNHG15 presented a downside tendency on regulating
   miR-141, and the miR-141 inhibitor dramatically changeover the impacts
   of SNHG15 depression on tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, SIRT1 was
   verified as a functional target of miR-141 in CRC cells. Besides, the
   suppression of SNHG15 remarkably controlled activating the
   Wnt/beta-catenin signals, which was reversed after inhibiting miR-141 at
   the same time. The investigated results in this research revealed that
   the increased expression of SNHG15 may enhance the process of CRC by
   acting as a ceRNA in regulating SIRT1 expression by sponging miR-141.
   Thus we propose that Wnt/beta-catenin signals may be a down-river
   regulator in mediating the impacts of SNHG15 in CRC and
   SNHG15-miR-141-SIRT1 axis may pave a new sight in explaining the
   biological processes of CRC.},

Abstract = {Background Because of the high density of fat, high-fat diets are
   perceived as likely to lead to increased bodyweight, hence health-care
   providers are reluctant to recommend them to overweight or obese
   individuals. We assessed the long-term effects of ad libitum, high-fat,
   high-vegetable-fat Mediterranean diets on bodyweight and waist
   circumference in older people at risk of cardiovascular disease, most of
   whom were overweight or obese.
   Methods PREDIMED was a 5 year parallel-group, multicentre, randomised,
   controlled clinical trial done in primary care centres affiliated to 11
   hospitals in Spain. 7447 asymptomatic men (aged 55-80 years) and women
   (aged 60-80 years) who had type 2 diabetes or three or more
   cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned (1: 1: 1) with a
   computer-generated number sequence to one of three interventions:
   Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil (n=2543);
   Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=2454); or a control diet
   (advice to reduce dietary fat; n=2450). Energy restriction was not
   advised, nor was physical activity promoted. In this analysis of the
   trial, we measured bodyweight and waist circumference at baseline and
   yearly for 5 years in the intention-to-treat population. The PREDIMED
   trial is registered with ISRCTN.com, number ISRCTN35739639.
   Findings After a median 4.8 years (IQR 2.8-5.8) of follow-up,
   participants in all three groups had marginally reduced bodyweight and
   increased waist circumference. The adjusted difference in 5 year changes
   in bodyweight in the Mediterranean diet with olive oil group was -0.43
   kg (95\% CI -0.86 to -0.01; p=0.044) and in the nut group was -0.08 kg
   (-0.50 to 0.35; p=0.730), compared with the control group. The adjusted
   difference in 5 year changes in waist circumference was -0.55 cm (-1.16
   to -0.06; p=0.048) in the Mediterranean diet with olive oil group and
   -0.94 cm (-1.60 to -0.27; p=0.006) in the nut group, compared with the
   control group.
   Interpretation A long-term intervention with an unrestricted-calorie,
   high-vegetable-fat Mediterranean diet was associated with decreases in
   bodyweight and less gain in central adiposity compared with a control
   diet. These results lend support to advice not restricting intake of
   healthy fats for bodyweight maintenance.},

Abstract = {We developed a co-reduction method to synthesize octahedral, truncated
   octahedral, and cubic Rh2Ni nanocrystals. The shape/size distribution,
   structural characteristics, and composition of the Rh2Ni nanocrystals
   are investigated, and their possible formation mechanism at high
   temperatures in margaric acid/1-aminoheptadecane solution in the
   presence of tetraethylgermanium and borane trimethylamine complexes is
   proposed. A preliminary probing of the structure-activity dependence of
   the surface ``clean{''} Rh2Ni nanocrystals supported on carbon towards
   hydrazine (N2H4) in aqueous solution dehydrogenation revealed that the
   higher the percentage of \{111\} facets, the higher is the activity and
   H-2 selectivity of the nanocrystals. This result was attributed to the
   \{111\} facets not only introducing more basic sites, but also weakening
   the interaction between the produced adspecies (including H-2 and NHx)
   and surface metal atoms in comparison with those of \{100\} facets.
   Furthermore, the as-prepared Rh2Ni nanooctahedra exhibited 100\% H-2
   selectivity and high activity at room temperature for H-2 generation via
   N2H4 decomposition. The activation energy of the Rh2Ni nanooctahedra was
   41.6 +/- 1.2 kJ mol(-1). The Rh2Ni nanooctahedra were stable catalysts
   for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of N2H4, providing 27 723 total
   turnovers in 30 h. Our work provides a new perspective concerning the
   possibility of constructing hydrogen-producing systems based on N2H4 and
   surface ``clean{''} Rh2Ni nanocrystal catalysts with defined shapes
   supported on carbon that possess a competitive performance in comparison
   with NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrogen-producing systems for fuel cell
   applications.},

Abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative
   disease resulted from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic
   neurons in the pars compacta region of substantia nigra. The goal of
   this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of long
   noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HAGLROS on the apoptosis and autophagy in PD. The
   MPTP-induced PD mouse model and MPP+-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cell model were
   established, and the expression levels of HAGLROS and miR-100 were
   determined. Subsequently, the effects of suppression of HAGLROS on
   apoptosis and autophagy in MPTP-induced PD mouse model and in
   MPP+-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells were investigated. In addition, the
   association between HAGLROS and miR-100 as well as HAGLROS and
   activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase-B/mammalian
   target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway in MPP+-intoxicated SH-SY5Y
   cells was explored. HAGLROS was increasingly expressed in MPTP-induced
   PD mouse model and MPP+-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells and suppression of
   HAGLRO decreased apoptosis and autophagy in both in vivo and in vitro PD
   models. Further in vitro studies showed that HAGLRO negatively regulated
   miR-100 expression, and HAGLROS regulated apoptosis and autophagy of
   MPP+- intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells through sponging miR-100. Moreover,
   ATG10 was identified as a target of miR-100. Besides, suppression of
   HAGLROS alleviated MPP+-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cell injury by activating
   PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Our findings reveal that upregulation of HAGLROS
   may contribute to the development of PD via inhibiting apoptosis and
   autophagy, which may be achieved by regulating miR-100/ATG10 axis and
   PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation.},

Abstract = {Background/Aims: Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) are critical regulators
   in various diseases including human cancer and could function as
   competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate microRNAs (miRNAs).
   Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the
   expression of Inc-SNHG1 and miR-302/372/373/520 in pituitary tumor
   tissues and cell lines. Cell proliferation was investigated using MTT
   and cell count assays. The mechanisms by which Inc-SNHG1 affects
   pituitary tumor progression were investigated using Western blot assays,
   transwell migration assays, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,
   luciferase reporter assays, tumor xenografts, and flow cytometry.
   Results: We found that Inc-SNHG1 was overexpressed in invasive pituitary
   tumor tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression of Inc-SNHG1 promoted
   cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as the
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), by affecting the cell cycle and
   cell apoptosis in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Further study
   indicated that overexpression of Inc-SNHG1 markedly inhibited the
   expression of miR-302/372/373/520 (miRNA-pool) which is down-regulated
   in invasive pituitary tumor cells. Moreover, overexpression of Inc-SNHG1
   significantly promoted the expression of TGFBR2 and RAB11A, the direct
   targets of miR-302/372/373/520. Finally, Inc-SNHG1 activates the
   TGFBR2/SMAD3 and RAB11A/Wnt/beta-catenin pathways in pituitary tumor
   cells via sponging miR-302/372/373/520. Conclusions: Our data suggest
   that Inc-SNHG1 promotes the progression of pituitary tumors and is a
   potential therapeutic target for invasive pituitary tumor. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a nuclear transcription factor that in
   response to chemical and radiation stress regulates coordinated
   induction of a battery of cytoprotective gene expressions leading to
   cellular protection. In this study, we investigated the role of Src
   kinases in the regulation of Nrf2 and downstream signaling.
   siRNA-mediated inhibition of Fyn, Src, Yes, and Fgr, but not Lyn, in
   mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells, led to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and
   up-regulation of Nrf2 downstream gene expression. Mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts with combined deficiency of Fyn/Src/Yes/Fgr supported
   results from siRNA. In addition, steady-state overexpression of Fyn,
   Src, and Yes phosphorylated Nrf2Tyr568 that triggered nuclear export and
   degradation of Nrf2 and down-regulation of Nrf2 downstream gene
   expression. Exposure of cells to antioxidant, oxidant, or UV radiation
   increased nuclear import of Fyn, Src, and Yes kinases, which
   phosphorylated Nrf2Tyr568 resulting in nuclear export and degradation of
   Nrf2. Further analysis revealed that stress-activated GSK3 beta acted
   upstream to the Src kinases and phosphorylated the Src kinases, leading
   to their nuclear localization and Nrf2 phosphorylation. The
   overexpression of Src kinases in Hepa-1 cells led to decreased Nrf2,
   increased apoptosis, and decreased cell survival. Mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts deficient in Src kinases showed nuclear accumulation of
   Nrf2, induction of Nrf2 and downstream gene expression, reduced
   apoptosis, and increased cell survival. The studies together demonstrate
   that Src kinases play a critical role in nuclear export and degradation
   of Nrf2, thereby providing a negative feedback mechanism to switch off
   Nrf2 activation and restore normal cellular homeostasis.},

Abstract = {Overexpression of the PED/PEA-15 protein in muscle and adipose cells
   increases glucose transport and impairs further insulin induction. Like
   glucose transport, protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha: and -beta are also
   constitutively activated and are not further stimulatable by insulin in
   L6 skeletal muscle cells overexpressing PED (L6(PED)). PKC-xi features
   no basal change but completely loses insulin sensitivity in L6(PED). In
   these cells, blockage of PKC-alpha and -beta additively returns
   2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake to the levels of cells expressing only
   endogenous PED (L6(WT)). Blockage of PKC-alpha and -beta also restores
   insulin activation of PKC-xi in L6(PED) cells, with that of PKC-alpha
   sixfold more effective than PKC-beta. Similar effects on 2-DG uptake and
   PKC-xi were also achieved by 50-fold overexpression of PKC-alpha in
   L6(PED). In L6(WT) fivefoId overexpression of PKC-alpha or -beta
   increases basal 2-DG uptake and impairs further insulin induction with
   no effect on insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate
   phosphorylation. In these cells, overexpression of PKC-alpha blocks
   insulin induction of PKC-xi activity. PKC-beta is 10-fold less effective
   than PKC-alpha in inhibiting PKC-xi stimulation. Expression of the
   dominant-negative K-281-->W PKC-xi mutant simultaneously inhibits
   insulin activation of PKC-xi and 2-DG uptake in the L6(WT) cells. Me
   conclude that; activation of classic PKCs, mainly PRC-alpha, inhibits
   PKC-xi and may mediate the action of PED on glucose uptake in L6
   skeletal muscle cells.},

Abstract = {Amino acid precursors of dopamine and serotonin have been administered
   for decades to treat a variety of clinical conditions including
   depression, anxiety, insomnia, obesity, and a host of other illnesses.
   Dietary administration of these amino acids is designed to increase
   dopamine and serotonin levels within the body, particularly the brain.
   Convincing evidence exists that these precursors normally elevate
   dopamine and serotonin levels within critical brain tissues and other
   organs. However, their effects on urinary excretion of neurotransmitters
   are described in few studies and the results appear equivocal. The
   purpose of this study was to define, as precisely as possible, the
   influence of both 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and tyrosine on urinary
   excretion of serotonin and dopamine in a large human population
   consuming both 5-HTP and tyrosine. Curiously, only 5-HTP exhibited a
   marginal stimulatory influence on urinary serotonin excretion when 5-HTP
   doses were compared to urinary serotonin excretion; however, a robust
   relationship was observed when alterations in 5-HTP dose were compared
   to alterations in urinary serotonin excretion in individual patients.
   The data indicate three statistically discernible components to 5-HTP
   responses, including inverse, direct, and no relationships between
   urinary serotonin excretion and 5-HTP doses. The response to tyrosine
   was more consistent but primarily yielded an unexpected reduction in
   urinary dopamine excretion. These data indicate that the urinary
   excretion pattern of neurotransmitters after consumption of their
   precursors is far more complex than previously appreciated. These data
   on urinary neurotransmitter excretion might be relevant to understanding
   the effects of the precursors in other organs.},

   cancer and its potential regulatory mechanism. We measured the level of
   OGFRP1 in endometrial cancer tissues and evaluated the influences of
   OGFRP1 dysregulation on the tumour cell biological processes of
   endometrial cancer cells. Further, the regulatory relationships between
   OGFRP1 and miR-124-3p, between miR-124-3p and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) were,
   respectively, investigated. The interaction between OGFRP1 dysregulation
   and activation of PI3K/AKT/ GSK-3 beta pathway was revealed by Western
   blotting. OGFRP1 was up-regulated in endometrial cancer tissues and
   cells. OGFRP1 suppression inhibited the malignant behaviour (inhibited
   cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis, and suppressed cell migration
   and invasion) of the Ishikawa cells via negatively regulating
   miR-124-3p. SIRT1 was a target gene of miR-124-3p, and miR-124-3p
   regulated tumour growth and metastasis by the down-stream signal of
   SIRT1. Moreover, suppression of OGFRP1 restrained the activation of
   PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta signals in the Ishikawa cells via miR-124-3p/SIRT1
   axis. Our experiments revealed that upregulation of OGFRP1 may enhance
   the progression of endometrial cancer by regulating miR-124-3p/SIRT1
   axis and by activating PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathway. OGFRP1 may be of
   significance in illustrating the biology of endometrial cancer.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 885 (LINC00885) has been
   well studied in breast cancer; however, its contribution in cervical
   cancer remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the
   detailed functions of LINC00885 in cervical cancer and elucidate the
   underlying molecular regulation mechanism.
   Methods: The expression status of LINC00885 in cervical cancer was
   determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction and by searching The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The detailed
   functions of LINC00885 in cervical cancer cells were confirmed using
   Cell Counting Kit 8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, Transwell cell
   migration and invasion assays, and tumor xenograft assay. Mechanistic
   experiments included bioinformatics prediction, RNA immunoprecipitation,
   luciferase reporter assay, and rescue experiments.
   Results: LINC00885 was clearly overexpressed in cervical cancer, which
   was linked with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Functionally, LINC00885
   deficiency suppressed cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and
   invasion but stimulated cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, loss of
   LINC00885 restricted the growth of cervical cancer cells in vivo.
   Mechanistically, LINC00885 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA
   for microRNA-432-5p (miR-432-5p) in cervical cancer. Furthermore,
   metastasis-associated colon cancer 1 (MACC1) was confirmed as the direct
   target of miR-432-5p, and LINC00885 could enhance MACC1 expression by
   sequestering miR-432-5p. Rescue experiments revealed that silencing of
   miR-432-5p or upregulation of MACC1 expression could effectively
   counteract the restrained aggressive properties of cervical cancer cells
   induced by LINC00885 deficiency.
   Conclusion: LINC00885 upregulated MACC1 expression in cervical cancer
   cells by sponging miR-432-5p, thereby promoting cancer progression. The
   LINC00885/miR-432-5p/MACC1 pathway may help in the identification of
   potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cervical
   cancer.},

Abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a grievous neurology-related disorder that
   causes many devastating symptoms. This research planned to dig the
   function and latent mechanisms of long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) ANRIL on
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-disposed injury in PC-12 cells. The PC-12 cells
   were disposed with H2O2 for 24 h to construct the SCI model. H2O2
   -disposed PC-12 cells was assessed by detecting cell viability,
   migration, invasion, apoptosis and autophagy. The level of ANRIL in H2O2
   -disposed PC-12 cells was analysed, afterwards, the impacts of ANRIL
   silencing on H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cell injury was determined. The
   regulatory association between ANRIL and miR-499a, between miR-499a and
   PDCD4, as well as PDCD4 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signals were
   investigated. H2O2 produced PC-12 cell injury and promoted the level of
   ANRIL. Silencing of ANRIL inhibited H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cell injury
   through promoting cell viability, migration, invasion and inhibiting
   apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, miR-499a was upregulated after
   silencing of ANRIL, and inhibition of miR-499a reversed the effects of
   silencing of ANRIL on H2O2 -disposed PC-12 cell injury. Also, PDCD4 was
   a target of miR-499a. Furthermore, ANRIL silencing alleviated the H2O2
   -disposed injury in PC-12 cells possible by activating
   PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signals, which was mediated by miR-499a/PDCD4 axis.
   Our results indicate that high level of ANRIL may sharpen the degree of
   SCI via targeting miR-499a/PDCD4 axis to regulate the briskness of
   PI31K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signals.},

Abstract = {Background: Vitamin D may decrease depression symptoms through its
   beneficial effects on neurotransmitters, metabolic profiles, biomarkers
   of inflammation, and oxidative stress.
   Objective: This study was designed to assess whether vitamin D
   supplementation can reduce symptoms of depression, metabolic profiles,
   serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and biomarkers of
   oxidative stress in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
   trial was performed in 40 patients between 18 and 65 y of age with a
   diagnosis of MDD based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical
   Manual of Mental Disorders. Patients were randomly assigned to receive
   either a single capsule of 50 kill vitamin D/wk (n = 20) or placebo (n =
   20) for 8 wk. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and
   postintervention to quantify relevant variables. The primary {[}Beck
   Depression Inventory (BDI), which examines depressive symptoms] and
   secondary (glucose homeostasis variables, lipid profiles, hs-CRP, and
   biomarkers of oxidative stress) outcomes were assessed.
   Results: Baseline concentrations of mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were
   significantly different between the 2 groups (9.2 +/- 6.0 and 13.6 +/-
   7.9 mu g/L in the placebo and control groups, respectively, P = 0.02).
   After 8 wk of intervention, changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   concentrations were significantly greater in the vitamin D group (+20.4
   mu g/L) than in the placebo group (-0.9 mu g/L, P < 0.001). A trend
   toward a greater decrease in the BDI was observed in the vitamin D group
   than in the placebo group (-8.0 and -3.3, respectively, P= 0.06).
   Changes in serum insulin (-3.6 compared with +2.9 mu lU/mL, P= 0.02),
   estimated homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (-1.0
   compared with +0.6, P= 0.01), estimated homeostasis model assessment of
   beta cell function (-13.9 compared with +10.3, P = 0.03), plasma total
   antioxidant capacity (+63.1 compared with -23.4 mmol/L, P= 0.04), and
   glutathione (+170 compared with -213 mu mol/L, P = 0.04) in the vitamin
   D group were significantly different from those in the placebo group.
   Conclusion: Overall, vitamin D supplementation of patients with MDD for
   8 wk had beneficial effects on the BDI, indicators of glucose
   homeostasis, and oxidative stress. This trial was registered at

Abstract = {Background: Combined omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin D supplementation
   may improve multiple sclerosis (MS) by correcting metabolic
   abnormalities and attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty
   acid and vitamin D cosupplementation on the disability score and
   metabolic status of patients with MS.
   Methods: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with
   Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and inflammation as
   primary outcomes and oxidative stress biomarkers and metabolic profile
   as secondary outcomes. Patients, aged 18-55 y, were matched for disease
   EDSS scores, gender, medications, BMI, and age (n = 53) and randomly
   received a combined 2 x 1000 mg/d omega-3 fatty acid and 50,000
   IU/biweekly cholecalciferol supplement or placebo for 12 wk. The
   placebos were matched in colour, shape, size, packaging, smell, and
   taste with supplements. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline
   and end of intervention to measure different outcomes. Multiple linear
   regression models were used to assess treatment effects on outcomes
   adjusting for confounding variables.
   Results: Patients taking omega-3 fatty acid plus vitamin D supplements
   showed a significant improvement in EDSS (ss -0.18; 95\% CI: -0.33,
   -0.04; P = 0.01), compared with placebo. Serum high-sensitivity
   C-reactive protein (ss -1.70 mg/L; 95\% CI: -2.49, -0.90 mg/L; P <
   0.001), plasma total antioxidant capacity (ss + 55.4 mmol/L; 95\% CI:
   9.2, 101.6 mmol/L; P = 0.02), total glutathione (ss + 51.14 mu mol/L;
   95\% CI: 14.42, 87.87 mu mol/L; P = 0.007), and malondialdehyde
   concentrations (ss -0.86 mu mol/L; 95\% CI: -1.10, -0.63 mu mol/L; P <
   0.001) were significantly improved in the supplemented group compared
   with the placebo group. In addition, omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin D
   cosupplementation resulted in a significant reduction in serum insulin,
   insulin resistance, and total/HDL-cholesterol, and a significant
   increase in insulin sensitivity and serum HDL-cholesterol
   concentrations.
   Conclusion: Overall, taking omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin D supplements
   for 12 wk by patients with MS had beneficial effects on EDSS and
   metabolic status. This trial was registered at the Iranian website

Title = {Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) versus other fluid therapies: effects on
   kidney function},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2013},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Background
   Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) are synthetic colloids commonly used for
   fluid resuscitation to replace intravascular volume, yet they have been
   increasingly associated with adverse effects on kidney function. This is
   an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2010.
   Objectives
   To examine the effects of HES on kidney function compared to other fluid
   resuscitation therapies in different patient populations.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane
   Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, MetaRegister and reference lists of articles.
   The most recent search was completed on November 19, 2012.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which HES was
   compared to an alternate fluid therapy for the prevention or treatment
   of effective intravascular volume depletion. Primary outcomes were renal
   replacement therapy (RRT), author-defined kidney failure and acute
   kidney injury (AKI) as defined by the RIFLE criteria.
   Data collection and analysis
   Screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessments for each
   retrieved article were carried out by two authors using standardised
   forms. All outcomes were analysed using relative risk (RR) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (95\% CI). Authors were contacted when published
   data were incomplete. Preplanned sensitivity and subgroup analyses were
   performed after data were analysed with a random-effects model.
   Main results
   This review included 42 studies (11,399 patients) including 19 studies
   from the original review (2010), as well as 23 new studies. Fifteen
   studies were excluded from the original review (nine retracted from
   publication due to concerns about integrity of data and six lacking
   individual patient creatinine data for the calculation of RIFLE
   criteria). Overall, there was a significant increase in the need for RRT
   in the HES treated individuals compared to individuals treated with
   other fluid therapies (RR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.16 to 1.49; 19 studies, 9857
   patients) and the number with author-defined kidney failure (RR 1.59,
   95\% CI 1.26 to 2.00; 15 studies, 1361 patients). The RR of AKI based on
   RIFLE-F (failure) criteria also showed an increased risk of AKI in
   individuals treated with HES products (RR 1.14, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.30; 15
   studies, 8402 participants). The risk of meeting urine output and
   creatinine based RIFLE-R (risk) criteria for AKI was in contrast in
   favour of HES therapies (RR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.91 to 0.99; 20 studies, 8769
   patients). However, when RIFLE-R urine output based outcomes were
   excluded as per study protocol, the direction of AKI risk again favoured
   the other fluid type, with a non-significant RR of AKI in HES treated
   patients (RR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.97 to 1.14; 8445 patients). A more robust
   effect was seen for the RIFLE-I (injury) outcome, with a RR of AKI of
   1.22 (95\% CI 1.08 to 1.37; 8338 patients). No differences between
   subgroups for the RRT and RIFLE-F based outcomes were seen between
   sepsis versus non-sepsis patients, high molecular weight (MW) and degree
   of substitution (DS) versus low MW and DS (>= 200 kDa and > 0.4 DS
   versus 130 kDa and 0.4 DS) HES solutions, or high versus low dose
   treatments (i.e. >= 2 L versus < 2 L). There were differences identified
   between sepsis versus non-sepsis subgroups for the RIFLE-R and RIFLE-I
   based outcomes only, which may reflect the differing renal response to
   fluid resuscitation in pre-renal versus sepsis-associated AKI. Overall,
   methodological quality of the studies was good.
   Authors' conclusions
   The current evidence suggests that all HES products increase the risk in
   AKI and RRT in all patient populations and a safe volume of any HES
   solution has yet to be determined. In most clinical situations it is
   likely that these risks outweigh any benefits, and alternate volume
   replacement therapies should be used in place of HES products.},

Title = {Circumcision devices versus standard surgical techniques in adolescent
   and adult male circumcisions},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Background
   Medical circumcisions are among the most common surgical procedures
   performed in males. The usual indications are phimosis (inability to
   completely retract the foreskin and expose the glans due to a congenital
   or acquired constriction of the prepuce), paraphimosis (when the
   foreskin is not pulled back over the glans after retraction resulting in
   a tight constricting band which causes swelling of the distal penis and
   acute discomfort), balanoposthitis (erythema and edema of the prepuce
   and glans) and balanitis (inflammation is confined to the glans; the
   foreskin is usually non-retractile). Circumcision devices have been
   developed to shorten the operative time, simplify techniques, and
   improve safety and cosmetic outcomes. The devices generally aim to crush
   the foreskin while simultaneously creating hemostasis, the foreskin is
   then excised or allowed to slough off. Their use is supposedly safer and
   easier to replicate than the standard dissection techniques. There are
   at least 20 devices for male circumcision on the market, yet their
   effectiveness has not been reviewed to date.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of device-based circumcisions compared with
   standard surgical techniques in adolescent and adult males (10 years old
   and above).
   Search methods
   We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions to the language
   of publication or publication status. We searched the Cochrane Library,
   MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, trials registries, grey
   literature sources and conference proceedings up to 16 April 2020.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials of device-based circumcisions
   (crush or ligature circumcision devices) compared to standard surgical
   dissection-based circumcision conducted by health professionals in a
   medical setting.
   Data collection and analysis
   At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and
   extracted data from the included studies. We classified adverse events
   into serious, moderate or mild. We reported study results as risk ratios
   (RR) or mean differences (MD) using 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and a
   random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the overall
   certainty of the evidence for each outcome.
   Main results
   Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials were conducted in
   China, South Africa, Kenya and Zambia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and
   Zimbabwe.
   Primary outcomes
   Serious adverse events: there were no serious adverse events in either
   treatment arm (11 trials, 3472 participants).
   Moderate adverse events: there may be a slight increase in moderate
   adverse events when devices are used compared to standard surgical
   techniques (RR 1.31, 95\% CI 0.55 to 3.10; I-2=68\%; 10 trials, 3370
   participants; low-certainty evidence); this corresponds to 8 more
   (ranging from 15 fewer to 84 more) moderate adverse events per 1000
   participants. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study
   limitations and imprecision.
   Secondary outcomes
   Mild adverse events: we are uncertain about the difference in mild
   adverse events between groups when devices are used compared to standard
   surgical techniques (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.44 to 2.72; I-2 = 91\%; 10
   trials, 3370 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded
   the certainty of the evidence for study limitations, imprecision and
   unexplained inconsistency.
   Operative time: operative time is probably about 17 minutes shorter when
   using a device rather than standard surgical techniques, which
   constitutes a clinically meaningful decrease in a procedure (MD -17.26
   minutes, 95\% CI -19.96 to -14.57; I-2 = 99\%; 14 trials, 4812
   participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty
   of the evidence for serious study limitations. The standard surgical
   technique generally takes about 24 minutes.
   There may be less postoperative pain during the first 24 hours when
   circumcision devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques
   (measured using a visual analog scale {[}VAS]; MD 1.30 cm lower, 95\% CI
   2.37 lower to 0.22 lower; I-2 = 99\%; 9 trials, 3022 participants;
   low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for
   study limitations and unexplained heterogeneity. There may be little or
   no difference in postoperative pain experienced during the first seven
   days when compared with standard surgical techniques (measured using a
   VAS; MD 0.11 cm higher, 95\% CI 0.89 lower to 1.11 higher; I-2 = 94\%; 4
   trials, 1430 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the
   certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained
   inconsistency. A higher score on the VAS indicates greater pain.
   Participants may slightly prefer circumcision devices compared to
   standard surgical techniques (RR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.37; I-2 = 97\%;
   15 trials, 4501 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the
   certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained
   inconsistency. We recorded satisfaction as a dichotomous outcome. Higher
   rates reflected greater satisfaction.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found that there were no serious adverse events reported when using a
   circumcision device compared to standard surgical techniques, but they
   may slightly increase moderate adverse effects, and it is unclear
   whether there is a difference in mild adverse effects. Use of
   circumcision devices probably reduces the time of the procedure by about
   17 minutes, a clinically meaningful time saving. For patients, use of
   the circumcision device may result in lower pain scores during the first
   24 hours and patients may be slightly more satisfied with it compared
   with standard surgical techniques. Clinicians, patients and policymakers
   can use these results in conjunction with their own contextual factors
   to inform the approach that best suits their healthcare settings.
   High-quality trials evaluating this intervention are needed to provide
   further certainty regarding the rates of adverse effects and
   postoperative pain of using devices compared to standard approaches.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors make a brief report on the strong ground
   motions observed in the midst of the heavily damaged zone during the 16
   April M-w 7.0 mainshock of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake. The
   observation was accidentally made by a dense seismic array that was
   deployed by the authors with the intention of observing aftershocks of
   the 14 April M-w 6.2 event, which later turned into the foreshock of the
   M-w 7.0 event. The observed ground motions are characterized by a
   large-amplitude pulse with an approximate period of 1 s that is
   predominant in the east-west (EW) components, which is comparable in
   shape to those observed during the 1994 Northridge and the 1995 Kobe
   earthquakes. In particular, the observed ground motions exceed the
   largest observed ground motions during the 1995 Kobe earthquake in terms
   of spectral accelerations in the 0.5-1.2 s period range. The importance
   of these records is that this was observed in the midst of a heavily
   damaged zone, where the ratio of totally collapsed wooden houses, due
   either to the foreshock or the mainshock, reportedly reached as high as
   50\% causing significant loss of life. Therefore, the records should be
   used in future research to reveal how the buildings were damaged, to
   develop appropriate measures, and to mitigate damages attributed to
   future large earthquakes.},

Title = {Interventions for treating persistent pain in survivors of torture},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Number = {8},
Abstract = {Background
   Persistent (chronic) pain is a frequent complaint in survivors of
   torture, particularly but not exclusively pain in the musculoskeletal
   system. Torture survivors may have no access to health care; where they
   do, they may not be recognised when they present, and the care available
   often falls short of their needs. There is a tendency in state and
   non-governmental organisations' services to focus on mental health, with
   poor understanding of persistent pain, while survivors may have many
   other legal, welfare, and social problems that take precedence over
   health care.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy of interventions for treating persistent pain and
   associated problems in survivors of torture.
   Search methods
   We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in any
   language in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, LILACS,
   and PsycINFO, from database inception to 1 February 2017. We also
   searched trials registers and grey literature databases.
   Selection criteria
   RCTs of interventions of any type (medical, physical, psychological)
   compared with any alternative intervention or no intervention, and with
   a pain outcome. Studies needed to have at least 10 participants in each
   arm for inclusion.
   Data collection and analysis
   We identified 3578 titles in total after deduplication; we selected 24
   full papers to assess for eligibility. We requested data from two
   completed trials without published results.
   We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We
   assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated standardised
   mean difference (SMD) and effect sizes with 95\% confidence intervals
   (CI). We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a `Summary of
   findings' table.
   Main results
   Three small published studies (88 participants) met the inclusion
   criteria, but one had been retracted from publication because of ethical
   problems concerned with confidentiality and financial irregularities.
   Since these did not affect the data, the study was retained in this
   review. Despite the search including any intervention, only two types
   were represented in the eligible studies: two trials used cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) with biofeedback versus waiting list on
   unspecified persistent pain (58 participants completed treatment), and
   one examined the effect of complex manual therapy versus self-treatment
   on low back pain (30 participants completed treatment). Excluded studies
   were largely either not RCTs or did not report pain as an outcome.
   There was no difference for the outcome of pain relief at the end of
   treatment between CBT and waiting list (two trials, 58 participants;
   SMD-0.05, 95\% CI-1.23 to 1.12) (very low quality evidence); one of
   these reported a three- month follow-up with no difference between
   intervention and comparison (28 participants; SMD-0.03, 95\% CI-0.28 to
   0.23) (very low quality evidence). The manual therapy trial also
   reported no difference between complex manual therapy and self-treatment
   (30 participants; SMD-0.48, 95\% CI 9.95 to 0.35) (very low quality
   evidence). Two studies reported dropouts, one with partial information
   on reasons; none of the studies reported adverse effects.
   There was no information from any study on the outcomes of use of
   analgesics or quality of life.
   Reduction in disability showed no difference at the end of treatment
   between CBT and waiting list (two trials, 57 participants; SMD-0.39,
   95\% CI-1.17 to 0.39) (very low quality evidence); one of these reported
   a three-month follow-up with no difference between intervention and
   comparison (28 participants; SMD 0, 95\% CI-0.74 to 0.74) (very low
   quality evidence). The manual therapy trial reported superiority of
   complex manual therapy over self-treatment for reducing disability (30
   participants; SMD-1.10, 95\% CI 1.88 to -0.33) (very low quality
   evidence).
   Reduction in distress showed no difference at the end of treatment
   between CBT and waiting list (two trials, 58 participants; SMD 0.07,
   95\% CI-0.46 to 0.60) (very low quality evidence); one of these reported
   a three-month follow-up with no difference between intervention and
   comparison (28 participants; SMD-0.24, 95\% CI-0.50 to 0.99) (very low
   quality evidence). The manual therapy trial reported superiority of
   complex manual therapy over self-treatment for reducing distress (30
   participants; SMD-1.26, 95\% CI 2.06 to-0.47) (very low quality
   evidence).
   The risk of bias was considered high given the small number of trials,
   small size of trials, and the likelihood that each was underpowered for
   the comparisons it reported. We primarily downgraded the quality of the
   evidence due to small numbers in trials, lack of intentionto-treat
   analyses, high unaccounted dropout, lack of detail on study methods, and
   CIs around effect sizes that included no effect, benefit, and harm.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any
   intervention for persistent pain in survivors of torture.},

Title = {Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating
   COVID-19},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2022},
Number = {9},
Abstract = {Background
   Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid (R)) aims to avoid severe COVID-19
   in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing
   hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few
   published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which
   indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid
   (R)) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without
   placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 and for
   preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses.
   To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living
   systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available
   to readers in-between publication of review updates.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO
   COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying
   completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and
   incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022.
   This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made
   publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.
   Selection criteria
   Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
   comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of
   care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of
   people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease
   severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2
   infection.
   We screened a El studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible
   if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered
   including appropriate ethics approval.
   Data collection and analysis
   We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of
   bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach
   for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19;
   2. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality,
   clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse
   events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in
   post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
   scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms,
   mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse
   events.
   We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people,
   socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs
   and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.
   Main results
   As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in
   outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID-19 comparing
   nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus
   placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous
   confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five
   days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to
   severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included
   medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4
   inducers.
   We identified eight ongoing studies.
   Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with
   asymptomatic or mild disease
   For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients
   nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of
   care plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio
   (RR) 0.04, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224
   participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people
   receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving
   nirmatreivir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence, and admission to
   hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95\% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1
   study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or
   deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or
   deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty
   evidence).
   Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse
   events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo
   (RR 0.24, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants;
   low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care
   probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events
   (RR 0.95, 95\% Cl 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants;
   moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related
   adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period
   compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95\% CI 1.44 to
   2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
   Nirmatreivir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases
   discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard
   of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224
   participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
   No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status,
   quality of life, and viral clearance.
   Subgroup analyses for equity
   Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1\% of the :
   modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants),
   of white ethnicity (71.5\%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1\% of
   study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient.
   The outcome `admission to hospital or death' was investigated for
   equity: age (< 65 years versus >= 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus
   Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between
   subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with
   nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in
   the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR=1). No
   subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country
   classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other
   outcomes.
   Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with
   moderate to severe disease
   No studies available.
   Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and
   PEP)
   No studies available.
   Authors' conclusions There is low-certainty evidence that
   nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and
   hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating
   unvaccinated COVID-19 participants without previous infection that were
   at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is
   low- to moderate-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe
   in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications
   highly dependent on CYP3A4.
   Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect
   size and direction were identified.
   No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized
   people with COVID-19 and to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   We will continually update our search and make search results available
   on OSF.},

Abstract = {inventions, like processes or products, have long been protected in many
   ways: secrecy, monopoly, trademarks, international conventions,
   regulations by public authorities. Nowadays, intellectual property
   rights (IPR) are regulated under the ``Trips{''} system (Trade-Related
   intellectual Property Rights) within the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
   WTO members have to protect innovative products or processes either by
   awarding a utility patent or through sui generis systems. For decades,
   plant breeders have developed ``plant variety protection
   certificates{''} which are awarded under an international UPOV
   convention implemented in 1968, revised in 1990. Since the 1980 decision
   of the US Supreme Court, living organisms or part thereof (including
   genes) became patentable subject matter. Thereafter, large numbers of
   patents have been delivered to life forms, some of which resulting in
   conflicting situations in terms of novelty, applicability, or
   infringment of biopatents. To illustrate some of the situations
   involved, four specific cases are analysed in this article, in order to
   evaluate the limits of biopatentability: i) Sequencing the human genome.
   The improvement of DNA sequencing techniques paved the way for
   characterizing the entire human genome. in the early stages of the
   project, results were published. In 1988, however, patents were
   requested for ``Est{''}, i.e. expressed sequence tags whose location or
   function were unknown. After a period of refusal, such patents were
   granted in the USA and later on in Europe, notwithstanding the
   opposition of a fraction of scientists who disputed their status of
   ``novelty{''}, considering it was like unduely patenting knowledge.
   After a period of unrest, President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair
   called for the publication of the whole genome sequence to the benefit
   of mankind. This was done, thus precluding further patentability of the
   human genome; ii) The saga of Monsanto suing the farmer Schmeiser. Percy
   Schmeiser successfully cropped canola in Saskatchewan (Western Canada)
   during half a century. Tests conducted in the 1998 crop revealed a high
   resistance to the glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup, due to the
   prevalence of genes patented by Monsanto and Monsanto Canada Inc. As
   Schmeiser never purchased Roundup-resistant canola seeds, nor obtained a
   licence to use them, Monsanto brought an action for patent infringement.
   Schmeiser denied any intentional introduction of patented genes on his
   land, and accused Monsanto of inadequate confinement of its patented
   material. The trial judge found the patent to be valid and allowed the
   action, granting \$CAN 19,832 compensation to Monsanto, together with
   \$CAN 153,000 of judiciary costs. The Federal Court of Appeal affirmed
   the decision and Schmeiser brought the appeal to the Supreme Court. The
   Court split five to four on the matter. The five majority justices
   confirmed that the farmer was guilty of infringement for ``using{''}
   patented canola without due authorization. Compensations were denied to
   Monsanto, however, because the company had elected accounting of profits
   as remedy. Considering that the appellant earned no profit from the
   invention, the Court ruled that the respondents were entitled to nothing
   on their claim of account. in view of this mixed result, it resolved
   that each party bear its own costs throughout. The four minority
   justices expressed views opposed to the majority ruling.
   They considered that plants, or their offspring, were unpatentable by
   law, so that a person skilled in the art Could not be expected to
   realize that patent protection of genes exends to standing crops. They
   therefore estimated that the lower Courts erred in considering gene
   patent infringement as applicable to plants and harvested grains.
   Furthermore, the complexity and nuances of ``innocent bystander{''}
   protection, in the context of agricultural biotechnology, should be
   expressly considered by Parliament, because it can only be inadequately
   accommodated by the law in use; iii) Revocation of the US patent granted
   to the yellow bean variety Enola. In 1999, the US Patent and Trademark
   Office (USPTO) patented a variety of common bean with yellow-coated
   seeds, under the name Enola. Originally, Enola parents had been bought
   on a market place in Mexico. After selection in Colorado State, Enola
   was patented. As yellow-seed beans are much appreciated by latinos, both
   in Mexico and in the United States, patenting Enola was challenged by
   Mexican bean growers, who argued the lack of novelty compared to yellow
   bean varieties previously cropped in their country. After a legal battle
   and further scientific evidence based on DNA comparison, it appeared
   that Enola could not be distinguished from hybrid yellow beans which
   preexisted in Mexico. In 2005, Enola patent was revocated for
   imprecision of the original request for patenting, and undue
   heterogeneity of parent and progeny seeds; iv) Revocation of the
   European patent granted to a process for the preparation of a fungicide
   from neem extracts. In 1994, the European Patent Office (EPO) patented a
   fungicide fraction extracted from neem, a tree originating from the
   Indian peninsula. Neem seed extracts had been used for many centuries in
   India, mainly as medicine, cosmetics, and control agents against fungi
   or insects. The patent, which had been granted jointly to Grace C
   degrees (New York) and to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), was
   challenged by a consortium of three ladies: a Belgian representative to
   the European parliament, together with an Indian NGO activist and an
   American NGO activist. In 2000, EPO revocated the patent for lack of
   inventivity, but the US government, together with Grace C degrees,
   called for appeal. Five years later, on march 8, 2005, the patent was
   made irrevocably void. The appeal body of EPO stated that patenting was
   denied to items previously known, including through local tradition. It
   should be noted that, during ten years, the neem marked had been in
   trouble as the result of the patent, thus inflicting indirect damage to
   the traditional users of neem extracts. It is concluded that
   patentability of living items should be clarified by including
   protection of intellectual property rights within the concept of
   ``bionomy{''}, which covers the highly complex components interacting in
   biosphere governance. The mere application of regular patent rules to
   biological items in a climate of ``con-imoditization{''}, resulted in
   undue patent delivery, which had either to be revocated (yellow-seed
   bean variety, fungicidal neem extracts), or to be retracted under
   political and ethical pressure (sequencing the human genome). Patent
   infrigment in open-field agriculture revealed very complex interactions,
   with split evaluation by judges in Court. Judiciarisation of this sector
   should receive due attention, in order to improve the coherence, both
   operational and legal, in protecting the mixed property rights involved.
   Time has come to solve the equation expressing relationships between
   these propert rights, when applied to genes, organisms, or crops within
   the complexity of open-field agricultural processes.},
