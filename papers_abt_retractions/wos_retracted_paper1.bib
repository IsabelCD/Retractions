Abstract = {Retraction is a mechanism for eliminating and correcting serious
   problems in the scientific literature and increasing awareness among
   members of the scientific community about unreliable literature. The
   objectives of this study were to identify the characteristics and
   reasons for retraction, analyze citations, and describe the scientific,
   altmetrics, and technological impacts of hematology retracted papers.
   Retracted papers were searched using the hematology category of the Web
   of Science database. The search yielded 101 retracted papers in WoS.
   Statistics methods such as frequency, mean, interquartile range (IQR),
   and Pearson's Correlation were used for data analysis. The findings
   showed the retracted papers were published in 28 different hematology
   journals. The majority of retracted documents were in Article type (n =
   81). The mean time interval of the retracted papers from the first
   publication to retraction was 50.83 months. The largest number of
   retracted papers belonged to the United States (n = 46). The most
   frequently reported reason for retraction was misconduct (n = 55). The
   findings of this study provide a landscape into the characteristics and
   citations of retracted papers before and after retraction in addition to
   the scientific, technological, and altmetrics impacts of hematology
   retracted papers in the scientific community.},

Title = {Review of retracted papers in the field of neurology},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 9},
Abstract = {Background and purpose: Despite the growing awareness of academic fraud,
   its prevalence in the field of neurology has not been fully assessed.
   This review aims to analyze the characteristics of the retracted papers
   in the field of neurology and the reasons for the retraction to better
   understand the trends in this area and to assist to avoid retraction
   incidents.Methods: A total of 79 papers were included, which pertained
   to 22 countries and 64 journals. The marking methods for retracting
   original papers included watermarks (89.04\%), retracted signs in the
   text (5.48\%) and no prompt (5.48\%). The median M (interquartile range
   {[}IQR]) of citations in retractions in neurology was 7 (41). Studies
   continued to be cited after retraction with an M (IQR) of 3 (16). The
   journal impact factor was between 0 and 157.335, with an M (IQR) of
   5.127 (3.668). 45.21\% and 31.51\% papers were mainly published in the
   first and second quartile journals, respectively. The M (IQR) time
   elapsed between publication and retraction was 32 (44) months. The
   reasons for retraction included two major categories, academic
   misconduct (79.75\%) and academic unintentional mistakes
   (20.25\%).Results and conclusions: The number of retractions in
   neurology has been on the rise over the past decade, with fabricated
   academic misconduct being the main cause of the retractions. Due to the
   long time lag between publication and retraction, a number of unreliable
   findings continue to be cited following retraction. In addition to the
   requisite standards of academic ethics, augmenting research training and
   fostering interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in enhancing
   research integrity.},

Title = {Retracted papers originating from paper mills: cross sectional study},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {379},
Month = {NOV 28},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES
   To describe retracted papers originating from paper mills, including
   their characteristics, visibility, and impact over time, and the
   journals in which they were published.
   DESIGN
   Cross sectional study.
   SETTING
   The Retraction Watch database was used for identification of retracted
   papers from paper mills, Web of Science was used for the total number of
   published papers, and data from Journal Citation Reports were collected
   to show characteristics of journals.
   PARTICIPANTS
   All paper mill papers retracted from 1 January 2004 to 26 June 2022 were
   included in the study. Papers bearing an expression of concern were
   excluded.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the sample and analyse
   the trend of retracted paper mill papers over time, and to analyse their
   impact and visibility by reference to the number of citations received.
   RESULTS
   1182 retracted paper mill papers were identified. The publication of the
   first paper mill paper was in 2004 and the first retraction was in 2016;
   by 2021, paper mill retractions accounted for 772 (21.8\%) of the 3544
   total retractions. Overall, retracted paper mill papers were mostly
   published in journals of the second highest Journal Citation Reports
   quartile for impact factor (n=529 (44.8\%)) and listed four to six
   authors (n=602 (50.9\%)). Of the 1182 papers, almost all listed authors
   of 1143 (96.8\%) paper mill retractions came from Chinese institutions
   and 909 (76.9\%) listed a hospital as a primary affiliation. 15 journals
   accounted for 812 (68.7\%) of 1182 paper mill retractions, with one
   journal accounting for 166 (14.0\%). Nearly all (n=1083, 93.8\%) paper
   mill retractions had received at least one citation since publication,
   with a median of 11 (interquartile range 5-22) citations received.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Papers retracted originating from paper mills are increasing in
   frequency, posing a problem for the research community. Retracted paper
   mill papers most commonly originated from China and were published in a
   small number of journals. Nevertheless, detected paper mill papers might
   be substantially different from those that are not detected. New
   mechanisms are needed to identify and avoid this relatively new type of
   misconduct.},

Abstract = {Retracted papers often circulate widely on social media, digital news,
   and other websites before their official retraction. The spread of
   potentially inaccurate or misleading results from retracted papers can
   harm the scientific community and the public. Here, we quantify the
   amount and type of attention 3,851 retracted papers received over time
   in different online platforms. Comparing with a set of nonretracted
   control papers from the same journals with similar publication year,
   number of coauthors, and author impact, we show that retracted papers
   receive more attention after publication not only on social media but
   also, on heavily curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge
   repositories, amplifying the negative impact on the public. At the same
   time, we find that posts on Twitter tend to express more criticism about
   retracted than about control papers, suggesting that
   criticism-expressing tweets could contain factual information about
   problematic papers. Most importantly, around the time they are
   retracted, papers generate discussions that are primarily about the
   retraction incident rather than about research findings, showing that by
   this point, papers have exhausted attention to their results and
   highlighting the limited effect of retractions. Our findings reveal the
   extent to which retracted papers are discussed on different online
   platforms and identify at scale audience criticism toward them. In this
   context, we show that retraction is not an effective tool to reduce
   online attention to problematic papers.},

Title = {An analysis of retracted papers in Computer Science},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {ContextThe retraction of research papers, for whatever reason, is a
   growing phenomenon. However, although retracted paper information is
   publicly available via publishers, it is somewhat distributed and
   inconsistent. ObjectiveThe aim is to assess: (i) the extent and nature
   of retracted research in Computer Science (CS) (ii) the post-retraction
   citation behaviour of retracted works and (iii) the potential impact
   upon systematic reviews and mapping studies. MethodWe analyse the
   Retraction Watch database and take citation information from the Web of
   Science and Google scholar. ResultsWe find that of the 33,955 entries in
   the Retraction watch database (16 May 2022), 2,816 are classified as CS,
   i.e., approximate to 8\%. For CS, 56\% of retracted papers provide
   little or no information as to the reasons. This contrasts with 26\% for
   other disciplines. There is also some disparity between different
   publishers, a tendency for multiple versions of a retracted paper to be
   available beyond the Version of Record (VoR), and for new citations long
   after a paper is officially retracted (median = 3; maximum = 18).
   Systematic reviews are also impacted with approximate to 30\% of the
   retracted papers having one or more citations from a review.
   ConclusionsUnfortunately, retraction seems to be a sufficiently common
   outcome for a scientific paper that we as a research community need to
   take it more seriously, e.g., standardising procedures and taxonomies
   across publishers and the provision of appropriate research tools.
   Finally, we recommend particular caution when undertaking secondary
   analyses and meta-analyses which are at risk of becoming contaminated by
   these problem primary studies.},

Abstract = {Science is constantly developing as new information is discovered.
   Papers discredited by the scientific community may be retracted. Such
   papers might have been cited before they were retracted (as well as
   afterwards), which potentially could spread a chain of unreliable
   information. To address this, Fu and Schneider (2020) introduced the
   keystone framework for auditing how and whether a paper fundamentally
   depends on another paper, and proposed that an alerting system be
   developed to flag papers that fundamentally depend on retracted papers.
   The need for expert labor is the main challenge of such alerting in such
   systems. This paper tests whether a flowchart process for non-experts
   could accurately assess dependencies between papers, reducing the need
   for expert assessment. We do this by developing such a process and
   testing it on citations to one highly cited retracted paper. In our case
   study, non-experts using our process can resolve the question of
   dependency in about half the cases. Two annotators had 92.9\% agreement
   on 85 papers annotated, with 100\% agreement after discussion. In future
   work we will assess the reliability of non-experts' decisions as
   compared to experts, and identify possibilities for automation.},

Title = {Why unethical papers should be retracted},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The purpose of retracting published papers is to maintain the integrity
   of academic research. Recent work in research ethics has devoted
   important attention to how to improve the system of paper retraction. In
   this context, the focus has primarily been on how to handle fraudulent
   or flawed research papers and how to encourage the retraction of papers
   based on honest mistakes. Less attention has been paid to whether papers
   that report unethical research-for example, research performed without
   appropriate concern for the moral rights and interests of the research
   participants-should be retracted. The aim of this paper is to examine to
   what extent retraction policies of academic journals and publishers
   address retractions of unethical research and to discuss critically
   various policy options and the reasons for accepting them. The paper
   starts by reviewing retraction policies of academic publishers. The
   results show that many journals do not have explicit policies for how to
   handle unethical research. Against this background, we then discuss four
   normative arguments for why unethical research should be retracted. In
   conclusion, we suggest a retraction policy in light of our empirical and
   normative investigations.},

Title = {An analysis of Malaysian retracted papers: Misconduct or mistakes?},

Abstract = {Retracted publications are a crucial, yet overlooked, issue in the
   scientific community. The purpose of this study was to analyze the
   prevalence, characteristics and reasons of Malaysian retracted papers.
   The Web of Science and Scopus databases were queried to identify
   Malaysian retracted publications. Available versions of original
   articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites.
   The publications were assessed for various characteristics, including
   reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics
   guidelines, and the authority calling for the retractions. From 2009 to
   June 2017, 125 Malaysian publications comprising (33 journal articles
   and 92 conference papers) were retracted. There was a spike in the
   prevalence of retracted articles in 2010 and 2012 with 42 articles
   (33.6\%) and 41 articles (32.8\%) respectively from the 125 retracted
   articles. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 1
   year. There is no significant relationship between a journal quartile
   and the mean number of months to retraction (P = 0.842). The reason for
   retraction for conference papers was specified as ``violation of
   publication principle{''}. Journal articles were retracted mainly for
   duplicate publication, plagiarism, compromised peer review process, and
   self-plagiarism. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and
   only 2 retracted articles have been accused of scientific mistakes. The
   study concludes that retractions were mostly due to the authors
   misconduct. Despite the increases, the proportion of published scholarly
   literature affected by retraction remains very small, indicating that
   retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially increasing and
   incipient, issue within Malaysian papers, which publishers as well as
   editors may have consistently and sufficiently addressed.},

Abstract = {Perpetuation of retracted publications is an ongoing and even increasing
   problem in the scientific community. In addition to the direct
   distortion of scientific credibility, the use of retracted findings for
   interpretation und discussion in subsequent publications poses the risk
   of drawing false and, for example in medical research, even harmful
   conclusions. One major contributor to this development is that many
   authors are not aware of the retraction status of a paper they cite.
   COPE guidelines state that the ``retracted status should be indicated as
   clearly as possible{''}, but this is definitely not true for many
   retracted publications. Likewise, databases do not consequently link
   retracted articles with the notice of retraction. Furthermore, many
   papers are deposit in the ``original{''}, i.e. pre-retraction version on
   personal or institutional websites or online repositories. Similarly,
   printed ``stock files{''} are obviously unaffected by a retraction.
   Clear identification of a retracted article using a watermark and in
   databases is a crucial step while incorporation of an electronic
   ``retraction check{''} in reference management software and during the
   online submission is necessary to detect and avoid citing retracted
   literature. Solving this problem needs the close attention of everybody
   involved in the publishing process: authors, reviewers, and publishers.},

Title = {Falsified papers in high-impact journals were slow to retract and
   indistinguishable from nonfraudulent papers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {464-470},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: The aim was to evaluate papers retracted due to falsification
   in high-impact journals.
   Study Design and Setting: We selected articles retracted due to
   allegations of falsification in January 1, 1980 to March 1, 2006 from
   journals with impact factor > 10 and > 30,000 annual citations. We
   evaluated characteristics of these papers and misconduct-involved
   authors and assessed whether they correlated with time to retraction. We
   also compared retracted articles vs. matched nonretracted articles in
   the same journals.
   Results: Fourteen eligible journals had 63 eligible retracted articles.
   Median time from publication to retraction was 28 months; it was 79
   months for articles where a senior researcher was implicated in the
   misconduct vs. 22 months when junior researchers were implicated
   (log-rank P < 0.001). For the 25 implicated authors, the median time
   from the first publication of a fraudulent paper to the first retraction
   was 34 months, again with a clear difference according to researcher
   rank (log-rank P = 0.001). Retracted articles didn't differ from matched
   nonretracted papers in citations received within 12 months, number of
   authors, country, funding, or field, but were twofold more likely to
   have multinational authorship (P = 0.049).
   Conclusions: Retractions due to falsification can take a long time,
   especially when senior researchers are implicated. Fraudulent articles
   are not obviously distinguishable from nonfraudulent ones. (c) 2008

Abstract = {As the number of retractions of the academic literature increase, there
   is also a bibliometric interest in appreciating the volume of citations
   that retracted papers received prior to, and following, a retraction. We
   assessed the pre-and post-citation counts of one paper each of five
   classes of retracted papers using the Web of Science Core Collection
   (WOS-CC). The papers (and their respective DOIs) were: (C1) Data or
   classification error (https:// doi. org/10.1371/journal. pone. 0204076);
   (C2) fraud (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-011-12080); C3) paper mill
   (https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2381482); C4) tortured phrase (https://

   were cited (September 7, 2022) 43, 45, 35, 3, and 16 times,
   respectively. Separately, noting the shortcomings of the WOS-CC citation
   classification system for citations, we propose a new four-tier
   classification system for citation sentiment or use (background;
   supportive; contradictory; manipulative) that accommodates both the
   functionality and sentiment of a citation to assess how a retracted
   paper (or indeed, any paper), is cited. We tested this new
   classification system using C5. We envision that these two new systems
   (five classes of retracted papers; four tiers of citation behavior) can
   further be implemented in citation databases to improve the informative
   value of these resources.},

Abstract = {Cancer research is occasionally described as being in a reproducibility
   crisis. The cancer literature has ample papers retracted due to
   misconduct, including the use of paper mills, invalid authorship, or
   fake data. The objective of this paper was to gain an appreciation of
   the balance of retractions and associated retraction notices of 23
   retracted Cancer Biotherapy and Radiopharmaceuticals papers associated
   with paper mills. By 23 March 2023, these retracted papers had already
   accumulated 287 citations according to Web of Science Core Collection,
   253 according to Scopus, and 365 according to Google Scholar, i.e.,
   metrically speaking, they were highly rewarded. All authors had an
   affiliation (71\% being a hospital) in China. Most (12/21; 57\%) of
   corresponding authors had emails with a @163.com suffix. Four of the
   retraction notices (i.e., 17\%) explicitly indicated paper mills as a
   reason for retraction although, in general, the retraction notices
   lacked details and background that could assist readers' understanding
   of the retractions.},

   retracted papers},
Journal = {LEARNED PUBLISHING},

Month = {2023 AUG 12},
Abstract = {Retracted articles by Indian scholars have received significant
   attention in recent times. However, no comprehensive study has been
   conducted to analyse the citations of retracted papers authored by
   Indian researchers. This study aimed to assess the citations to
   retracted works published between 2001 and 2020 pre- and
   post-retraction. The study found that there was an increase in
   retractions over time, with empirical data suggesting that the number of
   retractions has increased significantly, from 72 papers between 2001 and
   2010 to 365 papers between 2011 and 2020. Duplication (n = 128) and
   plagiarism (n = 119) were the primary reasons for retraction. Notably,
   90\% of the retracted articles continued to receive citations after
   retraction. Among the retracted papers, eight received more than 50
   post-retraction citations, 39 received 20 to 50 citations, 347 received
   one to 19 citations, and 43 were not cited at all post-retraction. There
   was an overall 8\% decrease in citations after retraction. Retractions
   were observed across journals of varying impact factor, with a higher
   number of retractions observed in journals with an impact factor of less
   than 5 (n = 286; 65\%). Furthermore, smaller research teams of two to
   five authors accounted for 72\% of the total retractions.},

Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {9},
Pages = {7351-7371},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study aims to analyze 343 retraction notices indexed in the Scopus
   database, published in 2001-2019, related to scientific articles
   (co-)written by at least one author affiliated with an Iranian
   institution. In order to determine reasons for retractions, we merged
   this database with the database from Retraction Watch. The data were
   analyzed using Excel 2016 and IBM-SPSS version 24.0, and visualized
   using VOSviewer software. Most of the retractions were due to fake peer
   review (95 retractions) and plagiarism (90). The average time between a
   publication and its retraction was 591 days. The maximum time-lag (about
   3000 days) occurred for papers retracted due to duplicate publications;
   the minimum time-lag (fewer than 100 days) was for papers retracted due
   to ``unspecified cause{''} (most of these were conference papers). As
   many as 48 (14\%) of the retracted papers were published in two medical
   journals: Tumor Biology (25 papers) and Diagnostic Pathology (23
   papers). From the institutional point of view, Islamic Azad University
   was the inglorious leader, contributing to over one-half (53.1\%) of
   retracted papers. Among the 343 retraction notices, 64 papers pertained
   to international collaborations with researchers from mainly Asian and
   European countries; Malaysia having the most retractions (22 papers).
   Since most retractions were due to fake peer review and plagiarism, the
   peer review system appears to be a weak point of the
   submission/publication process; if improved, the number of retractions
   would likely drop because of increased editorial control.},

Title = {When is lack of scientific integrity a reason for retracting a paper? A
   case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {144},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: The journal received a request to retract a paper reporting
   the results of a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. The
   present and immmediate past editors expand on the journal's decision not
   to retract this paper in spite of undisputable evidence of scientific
   misconduct on behalf of one of the investigators.
   Methods: The editors present an ethical reflection on the request to
   retract this randomized clinical trial with consideration of relevant
   guidelines from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and the
   International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) applied to
   the unique contextual issues of this case.
   Results: In this case, scientific misconduct by a blinded provider of a
   homeopathy intervention attempted to undermine the study blind. As part
   of the study, the integrity of the study blind was assessed. Neither
   participants nor homeopaths were able to identify whether the
   participant was assigned to homeopathic medicine or placebo. Central to
   the decision not to retract the paper was the fact that the rigorous
   scientific design provided evidence that the outcome of the study was
   not affected by the misconduct. The misconduct itself was thought to be
   insufficient reason to retract the paper.
   Conclusion: Retracting a paper of which the outcome is still valid was
   in itself considered unethical, as it takes away the opportunity to
   benefit from its results, rendering the whole study useless. In such
   cases, scientific misconduct is better handled through other
   professional channels.},

Title = {Research on retracted papers involving ethical issues in science and

Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {13},
Pages = {1621-1625},
Abstract = {The ethical governance of scientific and technical papers is an
   important part of the ethical governance system of science and
   technology. The scientific research involved in a paper should comply
   with the ethical norms of science and technology, conform to ethical
   review procedures, and satisfy informed consent and privacy protection.
   In this paper, we used the information of Retraction Watch Database to
   collect cases of retracted papers in international scientific and
   technical journals due to ethical issues, and manually reviewed the
   reasons for retraction to select those papers that were indeed retracted
   due to the violation of scientific and technical ethical norms. We
   analyzed the retracted papers in terms of their publication date,
   retraction time, subject area, and country, and explored the patterns
   and characteristics. For the subject areas to which the papers belonged,
   more than 90\% of the papers were in the field of biomedical research.
   Based on the reasons for retraction marked in the database and the
   specific descriptions in the retraction notices, we refined the
   classification of the reasons for retraction, including 17 aspects in
   three categories, such as violation of ethical review, informed consent,
   and ethical consensus norms, and then summarized the common problems
   involving ethics in scientific and technical papers, wishing to alert
   researchers and provide reference for the governance of scientific and
   technical ethics. At the same time, based on the analysis result in this
   paper, we conclude that since 2000, the number of papers retracted due
   to ethical issues began to appear and gradually increased, reflecting
   the increased ethical awareness of the scientific community and the
   increased concern of the ethical compliance of the scientific research
   activities involved in the papers. China ranks third in the world in the
   number of papers retracted due to ethical issues with a total of 92
   papers. Comparing the retraction rates of papers due to ethical issues
   in China and the United States between 2011 and 2020, we also found that
   the rate is higher in China. The ethical governance of science and
   technology involves many complex factors such as social culture,
   regulations and policies, and scientific research integrity, etc. From
   this paper, we found that the failure to obtain prior approval from the
   ethics committee for relevant research is the most important reason for
   paper retractions, so the entry point of work is to strengthen the
   standardized ethical review of scientific and technological activities.
   In addition, we suggest that China needs to strengthen ethical research,
   raise ethical awareness, and popularize ethics education in order to
   actively participate in international ethical governance. Finally,
   actions in scientific research activities that are contrary to the
   ethical norms of science and technology should be investigated and
   handled in accordance with the relevant regulations.},

Abstract = {Academics are expected to publish their research work. Hence, during the
   past few years, the scientific community has witnessed an
   ever-increasing growth and output in scientific papers. However, a large
   number of authors have violated ethical norms of research leading to
   retractions of their research works as well. The article focuses on the
   scientific fraud emanating from China and India in Health Sciences for a
   period of three years i.e. 2015 to 2018. The present data were extracted
   from a search filter term ``Research Articles OR Articles in Press{''}
   on the subject category of Health Sciences (HSC). A total of 318
   retracted papers were retrieved and the result of the study indicated
   that majority (268 items) of the retracted papers in Health Science
   originated from China, whereas just 50 retracted papers originated from
   India as on 21-02-2019. While analyzing the data, 26 redundant articles
   from China have been removed that received retraction notices. Further,
   the results of the study suggest that there are several factors
   associated with retraction of scientific papers, which include
   unreliable results, duplication of results, plagiarism, forged
   authorship, error in the text, error in data and so on.},

Abstract = {We present the first database-wide study on the citation contexts of
   retracted papers, which covers 7,813 retracted papers indexed in PubMed,
   169,434 citations collected from iCite, and 48,134 citation contexts
   identified from the XML version of the PubMed Central Open Access
   Subset. Compared with previous citation studies that focused on
   comparing citation counts using two time frames (i.e., preretraction and
   postretraction), our analyses show the longitudinal trends of citations
   to retracted papers in the past 60 years (1960-2020). Our temporal
   analyses show that retracted papers continued to be cited, but that old
   retracted papers stopped being cited as time progressed. Analysis of the
   text progression of pre- and postretraction citation contexts shows that
   retraction did not change the way the retracted papers were cited.
   Furthermore, among the 13,252 postretraction citation contexts, only 722
   (5.4\%) citation contexts acknowledged the retraction. In these 722
   citation contexts, the retracted papers were most commonly cited as
   related work or as an example of problematic science. Our findings
   deepen the understanding of why retraction does not stop citation and
   demonstrate that the vast majority of postretraction citations in

Title = {Women's representation as authors of retracted papers in the biomedical
   sciences},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Women are under-represented among authors of scientific papers. Although
   the number of retractions has been rising over the past few decades,
   gender differences among authors of retracted papers remain poorly
   understood. Therefore, this study investigated gender differences in
   authorship of retracted papers in biomedical sciences available on
   RetractionWatch. Among 35,635 biomedical articles retracted between 1970
   and 2022, including 20,849 first authors and 20,413 last authors, women
   accounted for 27.4\% {[}26.8 to 28.0] of first authors and 23.5\%
   {[}22.9 to 24.1] of last authors. The lowest representation of women was
   found for fraud (18.9\% {[}17.1 to 20.9] for first authors and 13.5\%
   {[}11.9 to 15.1] for last authors) and misconduct (19.5\% {[}17.3 to
   21.9] for first authors and 17.8\% {[}15.7 to 20.3] for last authors).
   Women's representation was the highest for issues related to editors and
   publishers (35.1\% {[}32.2 to 38.0] for first authors and 24.8\% {[}22.9
   to 26.8] for last authors) and errors (29.5\% {[}28.0 to 31.0] for first
   authors and 22.1\% {[}20.7 to 23.4] for last authors). Most retractions
   (60.9\%) had men as first and last authors. Gender equality could
   improve research integrity in biomedical sciences.},

Abstract = {Methodological mistakes, data errors, and scientific misconduct are
   considered prevalent problems in science that are often difficult to
   detect. In this study, we explore the potential of using data from
   Twitter for discovering problems with publications. In this case study,
   we analyzed tweet texts of three retracted publications about COVID-19
   (Coronavirus disease 2019)/SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2) and their retraction notices. We did not find early
   warning signs in tweet texts regarding one publication, but we did find
   tweets that casted doubt on the validity of the two other publications
   shortly after their publication date. An extension of our current work
   might lead to an early warning system that makes the scientific
   community aware of problems with certain publications. Other sources,
   such as blogs or post-publication peer-review sites, could be included
   in such an early warning system. The methodology proposed in this case
   study should be validated using larger publication sets that also
   include a control group, i.e., publications that were not retracted.},

   citation trends. All records of retracted articles from the first record
   in October 2004 to April 2022 were included. Sixty-seven retractions and
   870 citations pre- and post-retraction were analyzed. Results indicate a
   change of scenario that began in 2015, with recurrences of retracted
   articles allegedly produced by paper mills. The prevalence of
   retractions derived from professional misconduct in health research and
   the frequency of post-retraction citations in health sciences raise
   concerns in the chain of stakeholders, public health, and scientific

Title = {Learning from Retracted Papers Authored by the Highly Cited
   Iran-affiliated Researchers: Revisiting Research Policies and a Key
   Message to Clarivate Analytics},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Reasons underlying retractions of papers authored by the Iran-affiliated
   highly cited researchers (HCRs) have not been documented. Here, we
   report that 229 of the Iran-affiliated researchers were listed by the
   Clarivate Analytics as HCRs. We investigated the Retraction Watch
   Database and found that, in total, 51 papers authored by the
   Iran-affiliated HCRs were retracted from 2006 to 2019. Twenty-three of
   the 229 HCRs (10\%) had at least one paper retracted. One of the listed
   HCRs had 22 papers retracted; 14 of the 23 (60.8\%) had only one paper
   retracted. Among the 51 retracted papers, three had been authored by two
   female authors. Eight (16.8\%) retracted papers had international
   co-authorships. The shortest and longest times from publication to
   retraction were 20 and 2610 (mean +/- SD, 857 +/- 616) days,
   respectively. Of the 51 papers, 43 (84\%) had a single reason for
   retraction, whereas eight had multiple reasons. Among the 43 papers, 23
   (53\%) were retracted due to fake peer-review, eight (19\%) were
   duplications, six (14\%) had errors, four (9\%) had plagiarism, and two
   (5\%) were labelled as ``limited or no information.{''} Duplication of
   data, which is easily preventable, amounted to 27\%. Any publishing
   oversight committed by an HCR may not be tolerated because they
   represent the stakeholders of the scientific literature and stand as
   role-models for other peer researchers. Future policies supporting the
   Iranian academia should radically change by implementation of
   educational and awareness programs on publishing ethics to reduce the
   rate of retractions in Iran.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to describe and discuss some characteristics of
   the citing documents of Wakefield's paper, a retracted article due to
   fraudulent data and analysis on the relationship between vaccine and
   autism. All metadata of the 1,578 citing documents of Wakefield's paper
   were downloaded from Scopus, considering two periods before (1998-2004)
   and post retraction (2005-2020). The main results indicate that the 79\%
   of the citing documents are post retraction. In this period, we found
   the predominance of articles as well as other documents written in
   English but also in a wider-ranging of idioms. These documents are
   mostly associated with medicine and social sciences. These findings are
   a clear indication that this retracted paper is still popular and
   dispersed within a broader spectrum of fields in the global arena, from
   medicine and health sciences to social sciences. For future analysis, we
   intend to analyze the citing documents qualitatively, seeking to better
   understand the motivations for citing Wakefield's paper even after its
   retraction.},

Abstract = {Background: In 2019, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) authored by Dr.
   Ismail was retracted due to concerns about data integrity. Since there
   are no policies in place to investigate other publications of authors of
   retracted studies, we investigated Dr. Ismail's other trials.
   Methods: We searched for RCTs authored by Dr. Ismail. We made pairwise
   comparisons of values in baseline and outcome tables between trials. We
   assessed whether the distributions of baseline characteristics were
   compatible with properly conducted randomization, using Monte Carlo
   simulations and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We read the publications
   carefully for unusual features.
   Results: Dr. Ismail was author in eight published and one unpublished
   trial. In three of his first author studies we found multiple identical
   values in the baseline and/or outcome tables from different trials. At
   least some of the trials were unlikely to have followed a proper
   randomization process. There were a number of other unusual features in
   the papers we reviewed.
   Conclusions: It is probable that other trials published by Dr. Ismail
   contain questionable data. We call for a thorough investigation of the
   original trial data and related official documents. Our exercise
   suggests that the practice to assess research integrity should include
   all publications of authors with retracted fabricated articles. (C) 2021

Abstract = {The so-called altmetrics-short for alternative metrics-have gained their
   place in the scholarly publishing landscape, especially providing
   article-level complementary measures. But what do they point to? A
   hypothesis has found its way into the recent literature: they could be
   an early sign of impact, conveying in advance the information carried
   later by citations. Here the focus is on another possible relationship,
   namely, the one that may exist between alternative metrics and
   retractions. The research question is as follows: in comparison to
   non-retracted, contemporary publications, are the retracted articles
   likely to be more (or less) viewed and commented (but also << tweeted >>
   and << blogged >>) before the retraction takes place? The above
   relationship is tested on a set ofn = 209 papers retracted by PLoS ONE
   and a control group including 2n = 418 contemporary, non-retracted
   articles featured in the same journal. Significant and positive
   differences in means are found concerning the mentions in peer review
   sites and the number of views and downloads. On the whole, by
   considering five alternative metrics, about one-fourth of the
   retractions are predicted correctly.},

Abstract = {Though protection of human research subjects is universally recognized
   as a critical requirement for the ethical conduct of research, few
   studies have examined retractions of medical articles through apparent
   noncompliance with that requirement. From our survey of 99 retracted
   papers published from 1981 to 2011, we found that the basis for those
   decisions was poorly explained in retraction notices and that most of
   the articles continued to be cited. In retraction notices, the current
   manner of explaining failure to protect human subjects is misleading and
   confusing.},

Abstract = {The h-index, or Hirsch index, named after Jorge E. Hirsch, is one of the
   few author-based metrics currently available that offers a perspective
   of the productivity and citation impact of a scientist, researcher, or
   academic. There are four tools most commonly used to calculate the
   h-index, all of which depend on separate databases: Scopus, Web of
   Knowledge, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate. Using the h-index of the
   authors of this paper derived from these four sources, it is abundantly
   clear that scores vary widely and that it is unclear which of these
   sources is a reliable or accurate source of information, for any
   purpose. As the use and application of author-based metrics increases,
   including for official academic purposes, it is becoming increasingly
   important to know which source of the h-index is most accurate, and thus
   valid. Although this is not a review of the h-index, some perspectives
   are provided of the h-index-related literature to place this case study
   within a wider context of the weaknesses and criticisms of using the
   h-index as a metric to evaluate scientific outcome.},

Abstract = {The growth of the retraction databases reveals the disturbing trend in
   science and also the rising trend of citations of retracted papers is a
   serious concern. The objective of the study is to investigate the
   patterns of retractions through the team size and retracted citations.
   The publication records of 12,231 retracted papers indexed by Web of
   Science (WoS) are analyzed to investigate (i) the patterns of retraction
   associated with collaboration and team size; and (ii) the impact of
   retracted papers on the papers that are citing the retracted papers
   (retracted citations). The study demonstrates the collaboration patterns
   of retracted publications where 61.5\% of authors have only one and
   24.6\% have two retracted papers; however, 2\% of authors have more than
   retracted papers. Also, the temporal evolution of the team size reveals
   that teams smaller in size have more retractions. The impact of citing
   retracted papers reveals that 55.2\% of retracted papers have been cited
   at least once. 1/4th of the citations to the retracted papers are
   self-citations which themselves are retractions. On average 71.4\%
   citations are the non-retracted citations and 28.6\% citations are
   retracted citations which are mostly the self-citations. Last, the
   variation in average team size and average retracted citations in
   various research areas (having high retraction) is presented. Retracted
   publications in high-impact journals are highly cited.},

Abstract = {Retractions are rare in science, but there is growing concern about the
   impact retracted papers have. We present data on the retractions in the
   journal Science, between 1983 and 2017. Each year, approximately 2.6
   papers are retracted; that is about 0.34\% of the papers published in
   the journal. 30\% of the retracted papers are retracted within 1year of
   publication. Some papers are retracted almost 12years after publication.
   51\% of the retracted papers are retracted due to honest mistakes.
   Smaller research teams of 2-4 scientists are responsible for a
   disproportionately larger share of the retracted papers especially when
   it comes to retractions due to honest mistakes. In 60\% of thecases all
   authors sign the retraction notice.},

   citations},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},

Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {We investigate the citation frequency of retracted scientific papers in
   science. For the period of five years before and after retraction, we
   counted the citations to papers in a sample of over 3,000 retracted, and
   a matched sample of another 3,000 non-retracted papers. Retraction led
   to a decrease in average annual citation frequency from about 5 before,
   to 2 citations after retraction. In contrast, for non-retracted control
   papers the citation counts were 4, and 5, respectively. Put differently,
   we found only a limited effect of retraction: retraction decreased
   citation frequency only by about 60\%, as compared to non-retracted
   papers. Thus, retracted papers often live on. For effective
   self-correction the scientific enterprise needs to be more effective in
   removing retracted papers from the scientific record. We discuss recent
   proposals to do so.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {113-117},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background Papers retracted for fraud (data fabrication or data
   falsification) may represent a deliberate effort to deceive, a
   motivation fundamentally different from papers retracted for error. It
   is hypothesised that fraudulent authors target journals with a high
   impact factor (IF), have other fraudulent publications, diffuse
   responsibility across many co-authors, delay retracting fraudulent
   papers and publish from countries with a weak research infrastructure.
   Methods All 788 English language research papers retracted from the
   PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Data pertinent to
   each retracted paper were abstracted from the paper and the reasons for
   retraction were derived from the retraction notice and dichotomised as
   fraud or error. Data for each retracted article were entered in an Excel
   spreadsheet for analysis.
   Results Journal IF was higher for fraudulent papers (p<0.001). Roughly
   53\% of fraudulent papers were written by a first author who had written
   other retracted papers ('repeat offender'), whereas only 18\% of
   erroneous papers were written by a repeat offender (chi=88.40;
   p<0.0001). Fraudulent papers had more authors (p<0.001) and were
   retracted more slowly than erroneous papers (p<0.005). Surprisingly,
   there was significantly more fraud than error among retracted papers
   from the USA (chi(2)=8.71; p<0.05) compared with the rest of the world.
   Conclusions This study reports evidence consistent with the `deliberate
   fraud' hypothesis. The results suggest that papers retracted because of
   data fabrication or falsification represent a calculated effort to
   deceive. It is inferred that such behaviour is neither naive, feckless
   nor inadvertent.},

Volume = {37},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background Clinical papers so flawed that they are eventually retracted
   may put patients at risk. Patient risk could arise in a retracted
   primary study or in any secondary study that draws ideas or inspiration
   from a primary study.
   Methods To determine how many patients were put at risk, we evaluated
   788 retracted English-language papers published from 2000 to 2010,
   describing new research with humans or freshly derived human material.
   These primary papers-together with all secondary studies citing
   them-were evaluated using ISI Web of Knowledge. Excluded from study were
   468 basic science papers not studying fresh human material; 88 reviews
   presenting older data; 22 case reports; 7 papers retracted for journal
   error and 23 papers unavailable on Web of Knowledge. Overall, 180
   retracted primary papers (22.8\%) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects
   enrolled and patients treated in 180 primary studies and 851 secondary
   studies were combined.
   Results Retracted papers were cited over 5000 times, with 93\% of
   citations being research related, suggesting that ideas promulgated in
   retracted papers can influence subsequent research. Over 28 000 subjects
   were enrolled-and 9189 patients were treated-in 180 retracted primary
   studies. Over 400 000 subjects were enrolled-and 70 501 patients were
   treated-in 851 secondary studies which cited a retracted paper. Papers
   retracted for fraud (n=70) treated more patients per study (p<0.01) than
   papers retracted for error (n=110).
   Conclusions Many patients are put at risk by retracted studies. These
   are conservative estimates, as only patients enrolled in published
   clinical studies were tallied.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background Medical research so flawed as to be retracted may put
   patients at risk by influencing treatments.
   Objective To explore hypotheses that more patients are put at risk if a
   retracted paper appears in a journal with a high impact factor (IF) so
   that the paper is widely read; is written by a `repeat offender' author
   who has produced other retracted research; or is a clinical trial.
   Methods English language papers (n = 788) retracted from the PubMed
   database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Only those papers
   retracting research with humans or freshly derived human material were
   included; 180 retracted primary papers (22.8\%) met inclusion criteria.
   Subjects enrolled and patients treated were tallied, both in the
   retracted primary studies and in 851 secondary studies that cited a
   retracted primary paper.
   Results Retracted papers published in high-IF journals were cited more
   often (p = 0.0004) than those in low-IF journals, but there was no
   difference between high-and low-IF papers in subjects enrolled or
   patients treated. Retracted papers published by `repeat offender'
   authors did not enrol more subjects or treat more patients than papers
   by one-time offenders, nor was there a difference in number of
   citations. However, retracted clinical trials treated more patients (p =
   0.0002) and inspired secondary studies that put more patients at risk (p
   = 0.0019) than did other kinds of medical research.
   Conclusions If the goal is to minimise risk to patients, the appropriate
   focus is on clinical trials. Clinical trials form the foundation of
   evidence-based medicine; hence, the integrity of clinical trials must be
   protected.},

Abstract = {A faked peer review is a novel cause for retraction. We reviewed the
   characteristics of papers retracted due to a faked peer review. All
   papers retracted due to faked peer reviews were identified by searching
   the Retraction Watch website and by conducting a manual search. All
   identified papers were confirmed in published journals. The information
   of retracted papers was collected, which primarily included publisher,
   journal, journal impact factor, country, as well as publication and
   retraction year. Overall, 250 retracted papers were identified. They
   were published in 48 journals by six publishers. The top 5 journals
   included the Journal of Vibration and Control (24.8\%), Molecular
   Biology Reports (11.6\%), Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology
   (8.0\%), Tumour Biology (6.8\%) and European Journal of Medical Research
   (6.4\%). The publishers included SAGE (31\%), Springer (26\%), BioMed
   Central (18\%), Elsevier (13\%), Informa (11\%) and LWW (1\%). A
   minority (4\%) of retracted papers were published in Science Citation
   Index (SCI) journals with an impact factor of >5. A majority (74.8\%) of
   retracted papers were written by Chinese researchers. In terms of the
   publication year, the retracted papers were published since 2010, and
   the number of retracted papers peaked in 2014 (40.8\%). In terms of the
   retraction year, the retractions started in 2012, and the number of
   retractions peaked in 2015 (59.6\%). The number of papers retracted due
   to faked peer reviews differs largely among journals and countries. With
   the improvement of the peer review mechanism and increased education
   about publishing ethics, such academic misconduct may gradually
   disappear in future.},

Title = {Detecting academic fraud using Benford law: The case of Professor James
   Hunton},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {49},
Number = {8},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We investigate whether Benford's Law can be used to differentiate
   retracted academic papers that have employed fraudulent/manipulated data
   from other academic papers that have not been retracted. We use the case
   of Professor James Hunton who had 37 of his articles retracted because
   there were grave concerns that they contained mis-stated or fabricated
   datasets. We construct several Benford conformity measures, based on
   first significant digits contained in the articles, to determine whether
   Hunton's retracted papers differ significantly from a control group of
   non-retracted articles by competing authors. Our results clearly
   indicate that Hunton's retracted papers significantly deviate from
   Benford Law, relative to the control group of papers. In additional
   analysis we also find these results are generalisable to other authors
   with retracted papers. Our findings suggest that potentially both
   co-authors and journals could consider implementing a data analytical
   tool which employs Benford Law to highlight potential `red flag' papers,
   with a view to decreasing the risk of fraudulent activity and thereby
   enhancing the credibility of academic papers and journals.},

Title = {Retractions in the scientific literature: is the incidence of research
   fraud increasing?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {249-253},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background Scientific papers are retracted for many reasons including
   fraud (data fabrication or falsification) or error (plagiarism,
   scientific mistake, ethical problems). Growing attention to fraud in the
   lay press suggests that the incidence of fraud is increasing.
   Methods The reasons for retracting 742 English language research papers
   retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated.
   Reasons for retraction were initially dichotomised as fraud or error and
   then analysed to determine specific reasons for retraction.
   Results Error was more common than fraud (73.5\% of papers were
   retracted for error (or an undisclosed reason) vs 26.6\% retracted for
   fraud). Eight reasons for retraction were identified; the most common
   reason was scientific mistake in 234 papers (31.5\%), but 134 papers
   (18.1\%) were retracted for ambiguous reasons. Fabrication (including
   data plagiarism) was more common than text plagiarism. Total papers
   retracted per year have increased sharply over the decade (r=0.96; p <
   0.001), as have retractions specifically for fraud (r=0.89; p < 0.001).
   Journals now reach farther back in time to retract, both for fraud
   (r=0.87; p < 0.001) and for scientific mistakes (r=0.95; p < 0.001).
   Journals often fail to alert the naive reader; 31.8\% of retracted
   papers were not noted as retracted in any way.
   Conclusions Levels of misconduct appear to be higher than in the past.
   This may reflect either a real increase in the incidence of fraud or a
   greater effort on the part of journals to police the literature.
   However, research bias is rarely cited as a reason for retraction.},

   scientific community more comprehensively, this paper introduces the
   impact of retracted publications on technology, establishes the
   Multi-Dimensional Observation Framework of Retracted Publications from
   the five aspects, including Scientific impact, Scientists Impact,
   Technology Impact, Funding Impact and Altmetric Impact, and propose the
   use of multi-dimension bubble diagram and sanky diagram to show the
   multi-dimensional data. This paper takes all the retracted publications
   from the journal Cell as an example, using the observation framework to
   analyze them, and describes the impact of these papers from multiple
   dimensions. The results show that compared with the single dimension,
   the observation framework reveals the impact characteristics of
   retracted publications abundantly to some extent, and also expands the
   dimension of retracted publications' impact.},

Abstract = {To describe the impact of the retracted publications on the scientific
   community more comprehensively, this paper introduces the impact of
   retracted publications on technology. It establishes a multi-dimensional
   observation framework for retracted publications from four dimensions,
   including scientific impact, technological impact, funding impact and
   Altmetric impact, and proposes the use of a novel multidimensional
   bubble diagram to illustrate the multidimensional data. This study also
   proposes a two-dimensional classification of retraction reasons to help
   sort retracted papers, the results of which show the correlated features
   of those papers. This paper takes all the retracted publications from
   two top biomedical journals as a sample, uses the observation framework
   to analyze them and describes the impact of these papers from multiple
   dimensions. The results show that compared with one-dimensional
   analysis, this observation framework reveals the impact characteristics
   of retracted publications more comprehensively.},

Abstract = {In case of scientific misconduct, the papers can be retracted at the
   request of the journal's editors and/or authors. However, the retracted
   articles continue to be fully available through online resources,
   including journals websites. This paper argues that a classical
   retraction is insufficient to mitigate the adverse effect some retracted
   papers continue to have on critical issues, e.g. public health. The more
   strict approach, `Hard Retraction', is presented for consideration. Its
   implementation would lead to (1) complete deletion of the full text of
   the retracted paper, (2) substitution of the original abstract with a
   detailed retraction notice, (3) removal of the paper from the citation
   databases, (4) deposition of the retracted paper in the dedicated
   repository accessible for registered members. The benefits and risks of
   such an approach are discussed. Nevertheless, it should only be reserved
   for cases of fraud or grave errors with broad impacts.},

Title = {Retracted publications and their citation in dental literature: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Pages = {383-390},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objectives The present systematic review aimed to perform an in-depth
   analysis of the different features of retracted publications in the
   dental field.
   Material and methods This review has been recorded in the PROSPERO
   database (CRD42017075634). Two independent reviewers performed an
   electronic search (Pubmed, Retraction Watch) for retracted articles in
   dental literature up to December 31, 2018.
   Results 180 retracted papers were identified, the first published in
   2001. Retractions increased by 47\% in the last four-year period
   (2014-2018), when compared with 2009-2013 (94 and 64 retracted
   publications, respectively). Author misconduct was the most common
   reason for retraction (65.0\%), followed by honest scientific errors
   (12.2\%) and publisher-related issues (10.6\%). The majority of
   retracted research was conducted in Asia (55.6\%), with 49 papers
   written in India (27.2\%). 552 researchers (89\%) are listed as authors
   in only one retracted article, while 10 researchers (1.6\%) are present
   in five or more retracted publications. Retracted articles were cited
   530 times after retraction: the great majority of these citations
   (89.6\%) did not consider the existence of the retraction notice and
   treated data from retracted articles as reliable.
   Conclusions Retractions in dental literature have constantly increased
   in recent years, with the majority of them due to misconduct and fraud.
   The publication of unreliable research has many negative consequences.
   Studies derived from such material are designed on potentially incorrect
   bases, waste funds and resources, and most importantly, increase risk of
   incorrect treatment for patients. Citation of retracted papers
   represents a major issue for the scientific community.},

Title = {Risk factors of COVID-19 mortality: a systematic review of current

Journal = {EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {24},
Pages = {13089-13097},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the
   association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme
   (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were
   retracted due to significant methodological issues. Therefore, we aimed
   to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method
   and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We
   systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the
   results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in
   two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until
   June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19
   mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers.
   RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and
   clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of
   the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that
   both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with
   macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study
   showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide
   was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95\%
   confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that
   use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was
   associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91).
   CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two
   retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled
   trials and relevant cohort studies. we found out that
   (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of
   mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated
   with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.},

Abstract = {Let be a cardinal. The notion of -complete retract of a Boolean algebra
   has been studied by Dwinger. Specker lattice ordered groups were
   investigated by Conrad and Darnel. Assume that is a Specker lattice
   ordered group generated by a Boolean algebra (). The notion of -complete
   retract of can be defined analogously as in the case of Boolean
   algebras. In the present paper we deal with the relations between
   -complete retracts of and -complete retracts of ().},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background and Aims: Various aspects of retracted articles authored by
   Yoshitaka Fujii and their retraction notices have been examined. Yuhji
   Saitoh has coauthored many articles with Yoshitaka Fujii which were
   subsequently retracted. Japanese Society of Anesthesiology (JSA)
   recommends retraction of various articles by Yuhji Saitoh, but various
   attributes of those and their retraction notices have not been examined.
   Methods: A list of retracted articles was retrieved from PubMed,
   Retraction Watch Database and relevant journals. Their retraction
   notices were obtained from the journal's webpage. Predefined
   characteristics of the retracted articles and their retraction notices
   were evaluated against those proposed by Committee on Publication Ethics
   (COPE). Results: Fifteen such articles were retracted. Two of them were
   not identified as retracted in the journal webpage. Half of the papers
   mentioned by JSA are yet to be retracted. Among those retracted, only
   13.3\% retraction notices were in line with the guidelines published by
   the COPE. Two retracted articles are yet to be flagged as retracted in
   PubMed. The median (interquartile range) time required for retraction
   from the date of declaration of being eligible for retraction is 14 (3)
   months. Data were analysed with Microsoft Excel (TM) (2007). Conclusion:
   Even after more than 1 year of recommendation, many articles containing
   evidence of scientific misconduct are yet to be retracted. Among those
   retracted, the relevant authority failed to follow the prevalent and
   well-regarded standards of ethics in scholarly publication.},

Abstract = {Background: Retracted articles represent research withdrawn from the
   existing body of literature after publication. Research articles may be
   retracted for several reasons ranging from honest errors to intentional
   misconduct. They should not be used as reliable sources, and it is
   unclear why they are cited occasionally by other articles. This study
   hypothesized that several mechanisms may contribute to citing retracted
   literature and aimed to analyze the characteristics of articles citing
   retracted literature in anesthesiology and critical care.
   Methods: Using the Retraction Watch database, we retrieved retracted
   articles on anesthesiology and intensive care medicine up to August 16,
   2021, and identified the papers citing these retracted articles. A
   survey designed to investigate the reasons for citing these articles was
   sent to the corresponding authors of the citing papers.
   Results: We identified 478 retracted articles, 220 (46\%) of which were
   cited at least once. We contacted 1297 corresponding authors of the
   papers that cited these articles, 417 (30\%) of whom responded to our
   survey and were included in the final analysis. The median number of
   authors in the analyzed articles was five, and the median elapsed time
   from retraction to citation was 3 yr. Most of the corresponding authors
   (372, 89\%) were unaware of the retracted status of the cited article,
   mainly because of inadequate notification of the retraction status in
   journals and/or databases and the use of stored copies.
   Conclusions: The corresponding authors were generally unaware of the
   retraction of the cited article, usually because of inadequate
   identification of the retracted status in journals and/or web databases
   and the use of stored copies. Awareness of this phenomenon and rigorous
   control of the cited references before submitting a paper are of
   fundamental importance in research.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces the notion of a strong retract of an algebra and

   subuniverses of a unary algebra which are carriers of its strong
   retracts. This characterization enables us to describe the poset of
   strong retracts of a unary algebra under inclusion. Since this poset is
   not necessarily a lattice, we give a necessary and sufficient condition
   for the poset to be a lattice, as well as the full description of the
   poset.},

Abstract = {It is a well-known phenomenon in the study of graph retractions that
   most results about absolute retracts in the class of bipartite
   (irreflexive) graphs have analogues about absolute retracts in the class
   of reflexive graphs, and vice versa. In this paper we make some
   observations that make the connection explicit. We develop four natural
   transformations between reflexive graphs and bipartite graphs which
   preserve the property of being an absolute retract, and allow us to
   derive results about absolute reflexive retracts from similar results
   about absolute bipartite retracts and conversely. Then we introduce
   generic notions that specialize to the appropriate concepts in both
   cases. This paves the way to a unified view of both theories, leading to
   absolute retracts of general (i.e., partially reflexive) graphs.},

Title = {How do academia and society react to erroneous or deceitful claims? The
   case of retracted articles' recognition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Researchers give credit to peer-reviewed, and thus, credible
   publications through citations. Despite a rigorous reviewing process,
   certain articles undergo retraction due to disclosure of their ethical
   or scientific deficiencies. It is, therefore, important to understand
   how society and academia react to the erroneous or deceitful claims and
   purge the science of their unreliable results. Applying a matched-pairs
   research design, this study examined a sample of medicine-related
   retracted and non-retracted articles matched by their content
   similarity. The regression analysis revealed similarities in
   obsolescence trends of the retracted and non-retracted groups. The
   Generalized Estimating Equations showed that citations are affected by
   the retraction status, life after retraction, life cycle and the
   journals' previous reputation, with the two formers being the strongest
   in positively predicting the citations. The retracted papers obtain
   fewer citations either before or after retraction, implying academia's
   watchful reaction to the low-quality papers even before official
   announcement of their fallibility. They exhibit an equal or higher
   social recognition level regarding Tweets and Blog Mentions, while a
   lower status regarding Mendeley Readership. This could signify social
   users' sensibility regarding scientific quality since they probably
   publicise the retraction and warn against the retracted items in their
   tweets or blogs, while avoiding recording them in their Mendeley
   profiles. Further scrutiny is required to gain insight into the
   sensibility, if any, about scientific quality. The study's originality
   relies on matching the retracted and non-retracted papers with their
   topics and neutralising variations in their citation potentials. It is
   also the first study comparing the groups' social impacts.},

Abstract = {Let k be an infinite field. The notion of retract k-rationality was
   introduced by Saltman in the study of Noether's problem and other
   rationality problems. We will investigate the retract rationality of a
   field in this paper. Theorem 1: Let k subset of K subset of L be fields.
   If K is retract k-rational and L is retract K-rational, then L is
   retract k-rational. Theorem 2: For any finite group G containing an
   abelian normal subgroup H such that G/H is a cyclic group, for any
   complex representation G -> GL(V), the fixed field C(V)(G) is retract
   C-rational. Theorem 3: If G is a finite group, then all the Sylow
   subgroups of G are cyclic if and only if C-alpha(M)(G) is retract
   C-rational for all G-lattices M, for all short exact sequences alpha : 0
   -> C-x -> M-alpha -> M -> 0. Because the unramified Brauer group of a
   retract C-rational field is trivial. Theorems 2 and 3 generalize
   previous results of Bogomolov and Barge respectively (see Theorems 5.9
   and 6.1). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study examines the nature of citations to articles that were
   retracted in 2014. Out of 987 retracted articles found in ScienceDirect,
   an Elsevier full text database, we selected all articles that received
   more than 10 citations between January 2015 and March 2016. Since the
   retraction year was known for only about 83\% of the retracted articles,
   we chose to concentrate on recent citations, that for certain appeared
   after the cited paper was retracted. Overall, we analyzed 238 citing
   documents and identified the context of each citation as positive,
   negative or neutral. Our results show that the vast majority of
   citations to retracted articles are positive despite of the clear
   retraction notice on the publisher's platform and regardless of the
   reason for retraction. Positive citations can be also seen to articles
   that were retracted due to ethical misconduct, data fabrication and
   false reports. In light of these results, we listed some recommendations
   for publishers that could potentially minimize the referral to retracted
   studies as valid.},

Title = {Why Has the Number of Scientific Retractions Increased?},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Background: The number of retracted scientific publications has risen
   sharply, but it is unclear whether this reflects an increase in
   publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which
   flawed articles are withdrawn.
   Methods and Findings: We examined the interval between publication and
   retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed.
   Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of
   retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles
   published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among
   1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82
   months (p<0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers
   more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring
   retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that
   time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful
   scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor
   (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals,
   but only similar to 1\% of the variance in time-to-retraction was
   explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for
   plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication
   in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited
   in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple
   retractions was greater in 1972-1992 than in the current era (p<0.001).
   From 1972-1992, 46.0\% of retracted papers were written by authors with
   a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1\% of retracted papers were
   written by single-retraction authors (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect
   changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers
   to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and
   proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower
   barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for
   ``new{''} offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the
   time-to-retraction of flawed work.},

Abstract = {``Paper mills{''} are unethical outsourcing agencies proficient in
   fabricating fraudulent manuscripts submitted to scholarly journals. In
   earlier years, the activity of such companies involved plagiarism, but
   their processes have gained complexity, involving the fabrication of
   images and fake results. The objective of this study is to examine the
   main features of retracted paper mills' articles registered in the
   Retraction Watch database, from inception to the present, analyzing the
   number of articles per year, their number of citations, and their
   authorship network. Eligibility criteria for inclusion: retracted
   articles in any language due to paper mill activity. Retraction letters,
   notes, and notices, for exclusion. We collected the associated citations
   and the journals' impact factors of the retracted papers from Web of
   Science (Clarivate) and performed a data network analysis using
   VOSviewer software. This scoping review complies with PRISMA 2020
   statement and main extensions. After a thorough analysis of the data, we
   identified 325 retracted articles due to suspected operations published
   in 31 journals (with a mean impact factor of 3.1). These retractions
   have produced 3708 citations. Nearly all retracted papers have come from
   China. Journal's impact factor lower than 7, life sciences journals,
   cancer, and molecular biology topics were common among retracted
   studies. The rapid increase of retractions is highly challenging. Paper
   mills damage scientific research integrity, exacerbating fraud,
   plagiarism, fake images, and simulated results. Rheumatologists should
   be fully aware of this growing phenomenon.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Background: With greater use of social media platforms for promotions of
   research articles, retracted articles tend to receive approximately the
   same attention. We systematically analyzed retracted articles from
   retractionwatch.com to look at the Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS)
   garnered over a period of time in order to highlight the role of social
   media and other platforms in advertising retracted articles and its
   effect on the spread of misinformation. Methods: Retractionwatch.com was
   searched for coronavirus disease 2019 related retracted papers on
   November 6th, 2021. Articles were excluded based on lack of digital
   object identifier (DOI), if they were preprint articles, absent AAS, and
   incomplete AAS of pre retraction, post retraction, or both scores.
   Results: A total of 196 articles were found on the Retraction Watch
   website of which 189 were retracted papers and 7 were expression of
   concern (EOC). We then identified 175 articles after excluding those
   that did not have a DOI and 30 preprint articles were also excluded
   giving 145 articles. Further exclusion of articles with absent AAS and
   incomplete AAS resulted in a total of 22 articles. Conclusion: Retracted
   articles receive significant online attention. Twitter and Mendeley were
   the most popular medium for publicizing retracted articles, therefore
   more focus should be given by journals and their Twitter accounts to
   discredit all their retracted articles. Preprints should be reconsidered
   as a whole by journals due to the huge risk they carry in disseminating
   false information.},

Abstract = {If G is a group, a virtual retract of G is a subgroup, which is a
   retract of a finite index subgroup. Most of the paper focuses on two
   group properties: property (LR), that all finitely generated subgroups
   are virtual retracts; and property (VRC), that all cyclic subgroups are
   virtual retracts. We study the permanence of these properties under
   commensurability, amalgams over retracts, graph products, and wreath
   products. In particular, we show that (VRC) is stable under passing to
   finite index overgroups, while (LR) is not.
   The question whether all finitely generated virtually free groups
   satisfy (LR) motivates the remaining part of the paper, studying virtual
   free factors of such groups. We give a simple criterion characterizing
   when a finitely generated subgroup of a virtually free group is a free
   factor of a finite index subgroup. We apply this criterion to settle a
   conjecture of Brunner and Burns.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine how many papers have been
   retracted or withdrawn, and for what reason, in journals relating to
   plastic surgery.
   PubMed and SCOPUS were used, with the search terms (retracted OR
   withdrawn) AND (article OR publication OR paper) AND \{(plastic surgery)
   OR (cosmetic surgery) OR (maxillofacial surgery) OR (craniofacial
   surgery)\}. The papers were analyzed and classified according to the
   reason for retraction or withdrawal, journal name, publication year, and
   author. In the PubMed and SCOPUS, 227 and 114 titles were found,
   respectively, from which 34 duplicate titles were removed. An additional
   261 titles which did not include ``retracted'' or ``withdrawn'' were
   removed, leaving 46 papers and 6 mined papers were added. The 52 full
   texts (42 ``retracted'' and 10 ``withdrawn'') were analyzed.
   The most frequent reason for retraction or withdrawal was duplication
   (17, 32.7\%) followed by the author's request (9, 17.3\%), plagiarism
   (7, 13.5\%), and lack of permission (5, 9.6\%). Retraction was most
   common in Plast Reconstr Surg (6, 12\%) followed by Aesthetic Plast Surg
   (4, 7.9\%), Ann Plast Surg (2, 3.9\%), J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg (2,
   3.9\%), and Surg Res (2, 3.9\%). Most authors retracted a paper just
   once; however, 6 authors retracted a paper twice or more. The first
   retraction was found in 1991, and the number of retractions showed a
   tendency to increase over time. However, the duplication rate did not
   change over time (R-2 = 0.178, P = 0.117).
   Journal reviewers, as well as production editors, should check for
   duplication, plagiarism, or permission-related problems.},

Abstract = {Topological properties of the domain of attraction for dynamical systems
   are investigated. The main purpose of this paper is to prove that a
   compact, asymptotically stable attractor of a dynamical system defined
   on a locally compact metric space is a deformation retract of its domain
   of attraction, in a weak sense that is made precise. Under additional
   local assumptions, the attractor can be shown to be a retract, a
   deformation retract, or a strong deformation retract. The well known
   result that the domain of attraction of an asymptotically stable
   equilibrium is contractible follows as a corollary. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   Brown (R.F. Brown, Retraction methods in Nielsen fixed point theory,
   Pacific J. Math., 115(1984), 277-297) we introduce the notion of
   generalized retract of an operator. Some generic examples of such
   retracts are given. Using the techniques related to this generalized
   retract, we present some fixed point theorems for nonself operators on
   partial ordered sets, metric spaces, generalized metric spaces and
   Banach spaces. The conjecture of the generalized retracts reads as
   follows: Let f be a nonself operator defined on a subset with nonemply
   boundary. Each boundary condition (Leray-Schauder, Rothe, inwardness,
   outwardness,...) on f implies the existence of a generalized retract of
   f.},

Abstract = {Objective: To identify the characteristics of retracted publications in
   rehabilitation and sport sciences journals.
   Data Sources: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Retraction Watch databases
   were searched from inception to August 2019.
   Study Selection: Retracted publications published in rehabilitation or
   sport sciences journals, indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded
   (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were included.
   Data Extraction: One author extracted the data. Two other authors
   checked the data.
   Data Synthesis: A total of 37 and 52 retracted publications and their
   retraction notices were identified for rehabilitation and sport
   sciences, respectively. The majority of retracted publications (68\% of
   all retracted papers in rehabilitation and 54\% of all retracted papers
   in sport sciences) were published in the past decade. Retracted
   publications in rehabilitation and sport sciences were published in 21
   and 22 different journals and originated from 18 and 21 different
   countries, respectively. The full-text of the retracted publications was
   available with a retraction watermark or note for 59\% of cases in
   rehabilitation and 58\% in sport sciences. The reasons for the
   retractions were more often attributed to misconduct (79\% and 61\%)
   than to honest error (21\% and 39\%) in rehabilitation and sport
   sciences, respectively. However, a reason was not stated for 15\% of the
   publications. The median time interval between publication and
   retraction was 622 days in rehabilitation and 607 days in sport sciences
   publications.
   Conclusions: The total number of retracted publications in
   rehabilitation and sport sciences journals was small. The retracted
   publications have been published in a variety of rehabilitation and
   sport sciences journals and came from different countries across the
   world. Several retracted publications and retraction notices failed to
   adhere to The Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines in the handling
   of full-text (retain with a watermark or note) or stating the underlying
   reasons for the retraction. (C) 2020 by the American Congress of

Title = {Retractions in orthopaedic research A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW},
Journal = {BONE \& JOINT RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {263-268},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives
   Despite the fact that research fraud and misconduct are under scrutiny
   in the field of orthopaedic research, little systematic work has been
   done to uncover and characterise the underlying reasons for academic
   retractions in this field. The purpose of this study was to determine
   the rate of retractions and identify the reasons for retracted
   publications in the orthopaedic literature.
   Methods
   Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane
   Library (1995 to current) using MeSH keyword headings and the
   `retracted' filter. We also searched an independent website that reports
   and archives retracted scientific publications
   (www.retractionwatch.com). Two reviewers independently extracted data
   including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and
   country of origin.
   Results
   One hundred and ten retracted studies were included for data extraction.
   The retracted studies were published in journals with impact factors
   ranging from 0.000 (discontinued journals) to 13.262. In the 20-year
   search window, only 25 papers were retracted in the first ten years,
   with the remaining 85 papers retracted in the most recent decade. The
   most common reasons for retraction were fraudulent data (29), plagiarism
   (25) and duplicate publication (20). Retracted articles have been cited
   up to 165 times (median 6; interquartile range 2 to 19).
   Conclusion
   The rate of retractions in the orthopaedic literature is increasing,
   with the majority of retractions attributed to academic misconduct and
   fraud. Orthopaedic retractions originate from numerous journals and
   countries, indicating that misconduct issues are widespread. The results
   of this study highlight the need to address academic integrity when
   training the next generation of orthopaedic investigators.},

Abstract = {IntroductionInappropriate citation of retracted literature is a common
   problem in the general medical literature. In 2020, more than 2300
   articles were retracted, a dramatic increase from 38 in 2000. By
   exploring a contemporary series of retractions by one research group, we
   aimed to evaluate if citations of retracted articles is occurring in the
   area of regional anesthesiology. MethodsUsing the Scopus database, we
   examined the full text of all the articles citing research articles
   coauthored by an anesthesiologist who had multiple articles retracted in
   2022. After excluding the research articles citing non-retracted
   articles authored by the above mentioned anesthesiologist, we included
   in our analysis all the articles containing a retracted citation and
   published after the retraction notice. ResultsThe search was performed
   on October 30, 2022, retrieving a total of 121 articles citing the
   researcher's work. Among the retrieved articles, 53 correctly cited
   non-retracted research and 37 were published before the retraction
   notice. Among the 31 remaining articles, 42 retracted research papers
   were cited. Twenty-five of the retracted articles were cited in the
   Discussion section of the manuscripts, 15 in the Introduction section, 1
   in the Methods section (description of a technique), and one was cited
   in a review. No manuscript used the flawed data to calculate the sample
   size. DiscussionIn this contemporary example from the regional
   anesthesia literature, we identified that citation of retracted work
   remains a common phenomenon.},

Title = {Exploring perception of retraction based on mentioned status in
   post-retraction citations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The way retracted papers have been mentioned in post-retraction
   citations reflects the perception of the citing authors. The
   characteristics of post-retraction citations are therefore worth
   studying to provide insights into the prevention of the citation chain
   of retracted papers. In this study, full-text analysis is used to
   compare the distinctions of citation location and citation
   sentiment-attitudes and dispositions toward the cited work-between the
   conditions of correctly mentioning the retracted status (called CM) and
   not mentioning the retracted status (called NM). Statistical test is
   carried out to explore the effect of CM on post-retraction citations in
   the field of psychology. It is shown that the citation sentiment of CM
   is equally distributed as negative, neutral, and positive, while for NM,
   it is mainly distributed as the latter two. CM papers tend to cite
   retracted papers in Methodology, whereas NM papers cite more in
   Theoretical Background and Conclusion. The perception efficiency of
   retractions in psychology is low, where the average unaware duration
   (UD, the period between when the retraction note has been published and
   when the first citation directly pointed out its retracted status) lasts
   for 2.88 years. Also, UD is negatively correlated with the quantity of
   CM and the growth rate of NM, the proportionate change of NM before and
   after the first CM paper appears (P < 0.01). After being aware of
   retractions, the average rate of change (ARC, the total change divided
   by its taken time) of NM declines significantly (Z =-2.823, P < 0.01)
   whereas CM sees a raise in most disciplines, which contributes to the
   reduction of possible interdisciplinary impact.},

Abstract = {This paper mainly addresses design of retracting mechanism based on
   amphibious vehicle's low speed and strong resistance in water. Through
   analyzing problems faced in the design of amphibious vehicle, one kind
   of retracting mechanism based on double-wishbone independent suspension
   is proposed. The equations of key-points at suspension guiding mechanism
   are obtained, and the relationship between the length of hydraulic stick
   retracted and the height of wheel lifted are also calculated. Finally, a
   specific 3D model is built, and wheel alignment is determined, therefore
   a real mechanism is assembled to illustrate the retracting mechanism.},

Abstract = {We analysed how long it has taken for papers authored by Scott Reuben,
   Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii to be retracted: investigations into
   these three anaesthetists have shown much of their research to be
   unethical or fraudulent. To date, 94\% of their combined papers
   requiring retraction have been retracted; however, only 85\% of the
   retraction notices were compliant with guidelines produced by the
   Committee on Publication Ethics. We contacted the Editors-in-Chief
   and/or publishers of all the journals containing articles that had been
   identified as requiring retraction but had not yet been retracted. In
   response to our enquiries, 16 articles have since been retracted; we
   have documented the journals' responses regarding the remaining papers
   and await further retractions in the future. There is room for
   improvement in the way that unethical or fraudulent papers are handled
   by journals and publishers, beyond the identification of the authors'
   misconduct.},

Title = {Misinformation in the medical literature: What role do error and fraud
   play?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {37},
Number = {8},
Pages = {498-503},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Media attention to retracted research suggests that a substantial number
   of papers are corrupted by misinformation. In reality, every paper
   contains misinformation; at issue is whether the balance of correct
   versus incorrect information is acceptable. This paper postulates that
   analysis of retracted research papers can provide insight into medical
   misinformation, although retracted papers are not a random sample of
   incorrect papers. Error is the most common reason for retraction and
   error may be the principal cause of misinformation as well. Still,
   one-quarter of retracted papers are fraudulent, and misinformation may
   also arise through fraud. This paper hypothesises that error and fraud
   are the main sources of misinformation and that error is more common
   than fraud. Retraction removes misinformation from the literature; bias
   is non-retracted misinformation. Bias arises when scientific impropriety
   results in false research findings. Impropriety can involve experimental
   design, data collection, data analysis, or data presentation. Yet
   impropriety also arises through earnest error or statistical naivete;
   not all bias is fraud. Several measures are proposed to minimise
   misinformation in the medical literature, including: greater detail in
   the clinical trial registry, with rigorous definition of inclusion and
   exclusion criteria and primary endpoints; clear statistical criteria for
   every aspect of clinical trials, especially sample size; responsibility
   for data integrity that accrues to all named authors; increased
   transparency as to how the costs of research were paid; and greater
   clarity as to the reasons for retraction. Misinformation can arise
   without malicious intent; authors of incorrect papers are owed a
   presumption of incompetence, not malice.},

Abstract = {A silicone retractor that can be attached to suction pipes was developed
   in order to enhance the usability {[}1]. The measurement of the
   retracting force is desired in order to avoid damage to brain tissue due
   to an unexpected large force. This paper presents a force-sensing
   embedded silicone retractor that can be attached to suction pipes. The
   developed silicone retractor can provide three functions at the same
   time: suction, retracting, and retracting force measurement. The
   force-sensing system is based on a visualization mechanism that displays
   the force as a colored pole motion. The surgeon can then roughly
   estimate the retracting force. With a fiberscope, the retracting force
   can be measured with a resolution of 0.05-0.3 N. The retractor is made
   of silicone and has the advantages of disposability, low cost, and easy
   sterilization/disinfection. The system was validated through finite
   element method analysis and experiments.},

   for retraction. China (438), the United States (130), and India (51)
   have the largest share of retractions. These retracted publications were
   cited 5,659 times in other research publications, of which 1,559
   citations occurred after the retraction, which should raise concern.
   These retracted papers were also shared in online platforms, mainly on
   Twitter and by members of the general public. We recommend that the
   early detection of retracted papers may help to reduce the rate of
   citation and sharing of these publications, and minimize their negative

   Stanley-Reisner rings. Extending this result further, we give partial
   evidence for a conjecture saying that monomial quotients of standard
   graded polynomial rings over k descend along graded algebra retracts.

Abstract = {In {[}1], Bousfield studied a lattice (Bousfield lattice) on the stable
   homotopy category of spectra, and in {[}5], Hovey and Palmieri made the
   retract conjecture about that lattice. In this paper we generalize the
   Bousfield lattice and the retract conjecture to ones on a monoid. We
   also determine the structure of typical examples of generalized
   Bousfield lattices which satisfy the generalized retract conjecture. In
   particular we give explicitly the structure of the Bousfield lattice of
   the stable homotopy category of harmonic spectra.},

Title = {Silently withdrawn or retracted preprints related to Covid-19 are a
   scholarly threat and a potential public health risk: theoretical
   arguments and suggested recommendations},
Journal = {ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {751-757},
Abstract = {Purpose - Thousands of preprints related to Covid-19 have effused into
   the academic literature. Even though these are not peer-reviewed
   documents and have not been vetted by medical or other experts, several
   have been cited, while others have been widely promoted by the media.
   While many preprints eventually find their way into the published
   literature, usually through integrated publishing streams, there is a
   small body of preprints that have been opaquely withdrawn/retracted,
   without suitable reasons, leaving only a vestigial or skeletal record
   online. Others have, quite literally, vanished. This paper aims to
   examine some of those cases.
   Design/methodology/approach - For peer-reviewed literature, a retracted
   academic paper is usually watermarked with ``RETRACTED{''} across each
   page of the document, as recommended by ethical bodies such as the
   Committee on Publication Ethics, which represents thousands of journals
   and publishers. Curiously, even though pro-preprint groups claim that
   preprints are an integral part of the publication process and a
   scholarly instrument, there are no strict, detailed or established
   ethical guidelines for preprints on most preprint servers. This paper
   identifies select withdrawn/retracted preprints and emphasizes that the
   opaque removal of preprints from the scholarly record may constitute
   unscholarly, possibly even predatory or unethical, behavior.
   Findings - Strict ethical guidelines are urgently needed for preprints,
   and preprint authors, in the case of misconduct, should face the same
   procedure and consequences as standard peer-reviewed academic
   literature.
   Originality/value - Journals and publishers that have silently retracted
   or withdrawn preprints should reinstate them, as for regular retracted
   literature, except for highly exceptional cases.},

Abstract = {Scientific articles are retracted infrequently, yet have the potential
   to influence the scientific literature for years. The only randomised
   controlled trial to explore the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was retracted
   in 2008 due to falsified data. The objective of this research was to
   determine the frequency and nature of citations of this retracted paper.
   Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to determine the number of
   times the retracted article was cited. Citations were classified as
   either ``retraction acknowledged{''} or ``retraction not
   acknowledged{''}. The search was conducted on 6 August 2013 and updated
   on 25 March 2014. Results: The search resulted in 76 citations, of which
   24 occurred prior to the retraction of the article. Of the 52 citations
   occurring after the retraction, only two acknowledged the retraction. Of
   the citations not acknowledging the retraction, 20 referred to specific
   data and 30 cited the reference in passing. This retracted article
   continues to be cited by authors, suggesting that information about the
   retraction was unsuccessfully communicated to the scientific community.
   Continual citation of retracted literature has the potential to bias a
   field of research and potentially misinform end-users.},

Abstract = {Background As the volume of scientific publications increases, the rate
   of retraction of published papers is also likely to increase. In the
   present study, we report the characteristics of retracted papers from
   clinical neurosurgery and allied clinical and basic science specialties.
   Methods Retracted papers were identified using two separate search
   strategies on PubMed. Attributes of the retracted papers were collected
   from PubMed and the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for
   retraction were analyzed. The factors that correlated with time to
   retraction were identified. Detailed citation analysis for the retracted
   papers was performed. The retraction rates for neurosurgery journals
   were computed. Results A total of 191 retractions were identified; 55\%
   pertained to clinical neurosurgery. The most common reasons for
   retraction were plagiarism, duplication, and compromised peer review.
   The countries associated with the highest number of retractions were
   China, USA, and Japan. The full text of the retraction notice was not
   available for 11\% of the papers. A median of 50\% of all citations
   received by the papers occurredafterretraction. The factors that
   correlated with a longer time to retraction included basic science
   category, the number of collaborating departments, and the H-index of
   the journal. The overall rate of retractions in neurosurgery journals
   was 0.037\%. Conclusions The retraction notice needs to be freely
   available on all search engines. Plagiarism checks and reference checks
   prior to publication of papers (to ensure no retracted papers have been
   cited) must be mandatory. Mandatory data deposition would help overcome
   issues with data and results.},

Title = {Reasons for and time to retraction of genetics articles published

Volume = {56},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Introduction Between 0.02\% and 0.04\% of articles are retracted. We aim
   to: (a) describe the reasons for retraction of genetics articles and the
   time elapsed between the publication of an article and that of the
   retraction notice because of research misconduct (ie, fabrication,
   falsification, plagiarism); and (b) compare all these variables between
   retracted medical genetics (MG) and non-medical genetics (NMG) articles.
   Methods All retracted genetics articles published between 1970 and 2018
   were retrieved from the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for
   retraction were fabrication/falsification, plagiarism, duplication,
   unreliability, and authorship issues. Articles subject to investigation
   by company/institution, journal, US Office for Research Integrity or
   third party were also retrieved.
   Results 1582 retracted genetics articles (MG, n=690; NMG, n=892) were
   identified . Research misconduct and duplication were involved in 33\%
   and 24\% of retracted papers, respectively; 37\% were subject to
   investigation. Only 0.8\% of articles involved both
   fabrication/falsification and plagiarism. In this century the incidence
   of both plagiarism and duplication increased statistically significantly
   in genetics retracted articles; conversely, fabrication/falsification
   was significantly reduced. Time to retraction due to scientific
   misconduct was statistically significantly shorter in the period
   2006-2018 compared with 1970-2000. Fabrication/falsification was
   statistically significantly more common in NMG (28\%) than in MG (19\%)
   articles. MG articles were significantly more frequently investigated
   (45\%) than NMG articles (31\%). Time to retraction of articles due to
   fabrication/falsification was significantly shorter for MG (mean 4.7
   years) than for NMG (mean 6.4 years) articles; no differences for
   plagiarism (mean 2.3 years) were found. The USA (mainly NMG articles)
   and China (mainly MG articles) accounted for the largest number of
   retracted articles.
   Conclusion Genetics is a discipline with a high article retraction rate
   (estimated retraction rate 0.15\%). Fabrication/falsification and
   plagiarism were almost mutually exclusive reasons for article
   retraction. Retracted MG articles were more frequently subject to
   investigation than NMG articles. Retracted articles due to
   fabrication/falsification required 2.0-2.8 times longer to retract than
   when plagiarism was involved.},

Title = {Space-time singularities and the theory of retracts},
Journal = {PHYSICA SCRIPTA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {94},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In previous publications, we have started investigating some possible
   applications to the retraction theory in gravitational physics and
   showed that it can be very useful in providing proofs and explaining the
   topological bases. In the current work, we investigate the role of the
   retraction theory in the mathematical study of space-time singularities
   and suggest a topological restriction on the formation of singularities.
   Although we present a toy model using a 5D cosmological metric as an
   example, the current study applies for any collapsing system under the
   influence of gravity such as a massive star or the whole universe. After
   showing that the cosmological space-time M can be retracted into lower
   dimensional circles S-i subset of M, we prove the existence of a
   homotopy between this retraction and the identity map which defines a
   deformation retract on M. Since a circle does not deformation retract
   onto a point but it does retract to a point, the defined deformation
   retract stops any circle Si from retracting into a point which means no
   singularity is formed. The paper underlines the role of algebraic
   topology in the mathematical study of space-time singularities and
   represents a new application of the retraction theory in mathematical
   physics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},

Volume = {123},
Pages = {693-704},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper studies the oblique impact of droplets on microstructured
   superhydrophobic surfaces with the lattice Boltzmann method.
   Three-dimensional simulations are performed based on the pseudopotential
   multiphase model, with the Carnahan-Starling equation of state and the
   multiple-relaxation-time collision operator adopted to overcome the
   numerical instability problems at high liquid/gas density ratio and low
   fluid viscosity. The droplet impact dynamics is simulated in a wide
   range of normal Weber numbers (0-30), Ohnesorge numbers (0.002-3), and
   impact angles (15 degrees-90 degrees), with particular interest in
   understanding different types of bouncing behavior and their effects on
   the contact time. The results show that, among the four possible types
   of bouncing identified in the simulation, including conventional
   retracting bouncing, incomplete-retracting bouncing, impaled retracting
   bouncing, and tumbling bouncing, incomplete-retracting bouncing and
   tumbling bouncing have less contact time and could be facilitated by
   increasing the impact obliqueness. The increase in the normal Weber
   number leads to a transition from conventional retracting bouncing, to
   incomplete-retracting bouncing, and then to impaled retracting bouncing.
   The contact time shows a non-monotonic trend of
   ``decrease{''}-{''}increase{''}-{''}decrease{''} with enlarged Ohnesorge
   number, and the sheer drop in the contact time at high Ohnesorge numbers
   is due to the occurrence of tumbling bouncing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This paper presents a new underactuated robot gripper capable of
   retracting motion. Two fingers of the gripper consist of
   parallel-linkages and belts which can grasp objects and switch its
   motion to the retracting automatically. These gripping and retracting
   motions are given by a single motor through a planetary gear mechanism.
   Two angled wheels called a rotational resistance mechanism are pressed
   to the belts to regulate the distribution of the motor power. To verify
   the validity of the underactuated robot gripper, the experiments of the
   fabricated prototype are conducted.},

Abstract = {In 2005 the scientific misconduct case of a noted researcher concluded
   with, among other things, the retraction of 10 papers. However, these
   articles continue to be cited at relatively high rates. The objectives
   of this paper are: 1) to track the retraction process of these papers.
   2) to assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citation rates of
   these papers, and 3) to compare the citation history of these retracted
   articles and five other high-profile retraction cases. For objective 1.
   all five articles to be retracted were retracted and of the four to be
   corrected, two were retracted and two were corrected. Eight PubMed and
   journal sites were identified where retraction messages could be
   conveyed; the number of retraction messages averaged 3.4 +/- 2.5 for
   these nine articles. For objective 2, an absolute ``cleansing{''} did
   not occur. While it initially appears there was a relative
   ``cleansing,{''} as citation rates for these articles did decrease after
   retraction, the reductions in citation rates for these articles (-28\%)
   were the same as those for matched nonretracted publications both by the
   same author (-28\%) and by another investigator (-29\%) over the same
   time frame. Relative to objective 3, the results for this case are quite
   different from the five other cases assessing this issue, perhaps
   because of this investigator's ``citation inertia{''} as a result of the
   small percentage of his papers that were retracted and the large number
   of citations to the articles before their retraction and to all of his
   published articles.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The scientific misconduct and fraud case of a noted
   exercise physiology researcher was concluded similar to 15 yr ago, and
   one the of the results was the retraction of 10 published manuscripts.
   However, based on a number of comparisons to that same author's and
   another investigator's citation histories for similar articles, the
   citation histories for these retracted articles appear to not have been
   affected whatsoever in the subsequent 15 yr.},

Abstract = {Current sonothrombolysis techniques have limited efficacy for treating
   retracted clots. Nanodroplet (ND) mediated sonothrombolysis has the
   potential to facilitate tPA penetration into the dense fibrin networks
   of retracted clots via nanodroplet-induced cavitation. Intravascular
   sonothrombolysis is of interest to improve catheter directed clot
   treatments and mitigate off-target effects. This paper investigates the
   feasibility of nanodroplet-mediated sonothrombolysis with tPA to treat
   retracted clots, in vitro, using a forward-viewing intravascular
   transducer. The percent mass decrease of the retracted clots (mean +/-
   std) were 4 +/- 2\%, 20 +/- 3\%, 23 +/- 5\%, 38 +/- 9\% for the control,
   tPA + US, ND + US, and ND + tPA + US groups, respectively. All of the
   sonothrombolysis conditions resulted in statistically significantly
   higher clot lysis compared to the control group (p<0.05). The combined
   ND + tPA + US treatment significantly outperformed the ND + US condition
   (p<0.05) and approached significance for the tPA + US group (p = 0.09).
   In summary, our forward-viewing intravascular transducer was
   demonstrated, for the first time, for sonothrombolysis in a retracted
   clot model by combining NDs and tPA.},

Abstract = {During the past few decades, the rate of publication retractions has
   increased dramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate
   retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two
   fundamental questions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly
   impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this
   influence propagate to the wider academic community through scholarly
   associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of retracted articles
   indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran multiple
   experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set
   of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied
   the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific
   topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within
   those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly
   impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after
   retraction, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with
   retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second,
   this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader
   scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect.
   Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science
   committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or
   institutions related to retractions.},

Abstract = {Retracted publications are the special literature carriers revealing
   scientific errors and misconduct. Based on Web of Science, this paper
   accessed the authoritative and plentiful retracted publications through
   heterogeneous multi-source data and effective retrieval strategies.
   Then, the informetric analysis was performed on the retracted
   publications with a focus on the timeline, geological locations,
   disciplines, journals, institutions, and authors. Current findings show
   that there is a growing number of retracted publications worldwide as
   well as in mainland China. Recidivist and large-scale centralized
   publication retractions have exerted numerous influences on the changes
   in the number of retracted publications. Countries with strong
   scientific research capabilities have more retracted publications. In
   addition, the number of retracted publications has significant
   differences corresponding to different disciplines. Specifically, life
   science is a typical field that the retraction of scientific
   publications frequently occurred, which can also be seen in partial
   interdisciplinary publications. In terms of journals, which are counted
   as small group but with a high ratio of retraction should be further
   investigated. The institutions with more publications retracted can be
   divided into three types: institutions with more and scattered
   disciplines, institutions with more but concentrated disciplines, and
   institutions with fewer and concentrated disciplines. Recidivists are
   the focus at the author level and have quite different specific
   behavioral patterns. The main findings from the research are of great
   informetric value for the theoretical research on scientific norms and
   the practices of scientific research integrity supervision.},

Abstract = {Scientific publications with compromised integrity should be retracted.
   Papers citing retracted publications might need correction if findings
   depend on the retracted publication. While many studies have reported on
   post-retraction citations, few have focused on citations made before the
   retraction. We investigated the citation profile for a research group
   with 113 published concerns regarding publication integrity (CRPI). We
   identified 376 of their source publications that were cited by 5577
   articles, and whether the source publication had a published CRPI. Of
   6926 references to a source publication in these citing articles, for
   3925 (57\%) the source article had a published CRPI, while for 3001
   (43\%) it did not. Of these 3925 references, 3688 were in citing
   articles published before the source article CRPI was published. 166
   citing articles containing 198 references to source publications were
   published after the corresponding source article CRPI was published
   (range 1-5 such references/article; 19/166 (11\%) articles had >1
   reference). In summary, many articles cite retracted publications, with
   the majority of these references occurring before the retraction.
   However, very few publications assess the impact of the retracted
   citations, even though the findings of many might be altered, at least
   in part, by removal of the retracted citation.},

Title = {Surveying Retracted Studies and Notices Within the Field of Radiation
   Oncology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3},
Pages = {660-665},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to characterize retracted studies
   within the field of radiation oncology.
   Methods and Materials: Computerized searches were performed in Ovid
   MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2017
   looking for retracted studies using the terms ``retraction note,{''}
   ``retracted note,{''} ``withdrawn{''} and ``radiotherapy,{''} and
   ``radiation oncology.{''} Additional studies were identified by
   hand-searching 10 discipline-specific journals. Two authors
   independently screened papers and then extracted author demographics,
   journal characteristics, and retraction-specific variables.
   Results: Of the 58 studies identified, the most common reasons for
   retraction were misconduct (43\%), methodological error (21\%),
   authorship issues (5\%), unknown causes (5\%), and journal
   (administrative) errors (3\%). A total of 13 systematic reviews or
   protocols (22\%) were withdrawn from the Cochrane Library for being
   out-of-date or redundant. All but one retracted study and retraction
   notice were available in portable document format. Of the 57 retrieved
   papers, 79\% were identified as retracted via in-text notations or
   watermarks. Overall median time to retraction was 44 months
   (interquartile range, 11-98 months). However, 42 studies (72\%) were
   still cited after retraction notices were published.
   Conclusions: A retracted study within the field of radiation oncology
   remains a relatively uncommon event. Although promising, our data
   suggest that the majority of these retracted articles continue to be
   cited as valid research. As such, there is still a need for clinicians
   to remain vigilant with their academic rigor and good clinical research
   practices. There is an urgent need for publication houses to foster
   universal publishing standards along with discipline-specific retraction
   guidelines. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the publishing of a quantity of
   scientific research. In less than a year, a record of 200,000 scientific
   articles have been published on COVID-19. Publishing such a massive
   quantity of scientific research has instigated publishers to accelerate
   the review process. An upsurge in the publication rate has resulted in
   an increase in the retraction rate. This paper focuses on the COVID-19
   studies originating across the world from 1 January 2020 to 10 October
   2021. The data for this study were mined from
   http://retractiondatabase.org/. A total of 157 withdrawn articles on
   COVID-19 were retracted, and it was found that the United States of
   America contributed 31 (19.75\%) retracted articles. Also, 16 (51.61\%)
   of the retracted papers from the United States of America emerge in
   journals having an Impact Factor (IF). The study presents that 31
   (19.75\%) retracted articles were worked together by two authors, 26
   (16.56\%) with one author, and 22 (14.01\%) by five authors.
   Furthermore, Elsevier publishers have the highest retraction rate with
   80 (50.96\%). Half (50\%) of the articles were retracted with ``no
   information{''} as a reason for retraction. Other reasons for retraction
   include concern/issues about data, duplication, journal error, lack of
   approval from a third party, plagiarism, etc.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a circuit model was developed in RF ADS to simulate the
   coupling effect of a retracted whip on a PIFA (Planar Inverted ``F{''}
   antenna) antenna in a wireless handset application. A PIFA was designed
   as the main antenna of a handset to cover the 800MHz band (824MHz
   similar to 894 MHz) and 1900 MHz band (1850 MHz similar to 1990 MHz). A
   parasitic dual band whip antenna was used to improve the performance of
   the PIFA especially when the handset is used against the head. In such a
   whip-PIFA combination environment, the retracted whip will degrade the
   PIFA performance if it is not designed carefully. The purpose of this
   paper is to present an efficient method to optimize the PIFA performance
   when the whip is in retracted position.},

Abstract = {Scientific collaboration has considerably grown in recent years, and has
   been recognized as a positive factor for research productivity and
   quality. This study is aimed at exploring the collaboration in retracted
   publications and the influence on different kinds of scientific
   misbehaviors based on 4842 retracted publications in Web of Science Core
   Collection from 1978 to 2017. Search results showed that the proportion
   of international collaborations in retracted publications has fluctuated
   at around 20\% in the past 17 years, and different collaboration
   patterns of major countries are revealed. The USA and China contributed
   to more than half of all retracted publications, while retraction rate
   of Chinese papers was three times higher compared to papers from the
   USA. A negative correlation between the proportion of internationally
   collaborative publications and the retraction rate was found. Countries
   involved in more international collaborations tend to have lower
   retraction rates. Also, the occurrences of plagiarism was found to be
   lower when a paper is contributed by more authors, while falsification
   or manipulation, errors or unreliable results appeared more frequently
   under the same condition. Conclusions are made with a focus on the need
   for more actions to strengthen the scientific norms and integrity within
   collaborative groups.},

Abstract = {In this paper we investigate Tychonoff spaces which are retracts of
   paratopological groups. A strong necessary condition for that is the
   existence of a certain binary operation on the space (called a
   T-twister), which was introduced in {[}2,3]. Some general theorems are
   established which imply that beta omega is not a retract of a
   paratopological group. We also notice, using some deep results of V.V.
   Uspenskij, that the space omega(1) of countable ordinals is not a
   retract of any topological group (see Fact 3). (C)2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Retracting Inconclusive Research: Lessons from the S,ralini GM Maize
   Feeding Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL \& ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {621-633},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In September 2012, Gilles-Eric S,ralini and seven coauthors published an
   article in Food and Chemical Toxicology claiming that rats fed RoundupA
   (c)-resistant genetically modified maize alone, genetically modified
   maize with RoundupA (c), or RoundupA (c) for 2 years had a higher
   percentage of tumors and kidney and liver damage than normal controls.
   Shortly after this study was published, numerous scientists and several
   scientific organizations criticized the research as methodologically and
   ethically flawed. In January 2014, the journal retracted the article
   without the authors' consent on the grounds that the research was
   inconclusive. In June 2014, Environmental Sciences Europe published a
   slightly modified version of the retracted paper. The publication,
   retraction and subsequent republication of the S,ralini study raise
   important scientific and ethical issues for journal editors. Decisions
   to retract an article should be made on the basis of well-established
   policies. Articles should be retracted only for serious errors that
   undermine the reliability of the data or results, or for serious ethical
   lapses, such as research misconduct or mistreatment of animal or human
   subjects. Inconclusiveness, by itself, is not a sufficient reason for
   retracting an article, though a flawed study design might be. Retracted
   articles that are submitted for republication should undergo scientific
   review to ensure that they meet appropriate standards. Republished
   articles should be linked to the original, retracted publication.
   Journals that are reviewing studies with significant scientific and
   social implications should take special care to ensure that peer review
   is rigorous and fair.},

Title = {Experimental and numerical simulation of dynamic characteristics on
   single drop impacting hydrophilic wires},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {42},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The phenomenon that the drops impact the solid wall widely exists in
   industrial production. In this paper, the dynamic evolution of a single
   drop impacting a horizontal hydrophilic wire is explored through
   experiments and numerical simulation methods. Combined with the
   phenomena of spreading, retracting and breaking, the movement behavior
   law of the drop impacting the curved surface is analyzed. Furthermore,
   the effects of eccentricity, Weber number and wall wettability on drop
   impact spreading dynamics are studied. The results show that, with the
   increase of impact eccentricity, the drop impacting the wire appears
   symmetrical wrapping mode, asymmetrical wrapping mode, unilateral
   infiltration mode and partial wetting mode in turn. With the increase of
   the Weber number, the drop morphology appears in turn as
   spread-retracting, spread-splitting, spread-wrapping and spread-breaking
   modes when the axis of the drop impacts the wire. In addition, both
   eccentricity and Weber number have influence on the maximum spreading
   coefficient and the maximum spreading time. The wettability of wire has
   a significant effect on the spread-retracting behavior of drops. With
   the increase of hydrophilicity of wire, the peak dimensionless spreading
   area and spread-retracting stage of drops increase, and the retracting
   time is delayed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a circuit model is developed in RF ADS in order to
   simulate the coupling effect of a retracted whip on a planar inverted-F
   antenna (PIFA) for wireless-handset application. The PIFA is designed as
   the main antenna of the handset to cover the 800-MHz (824-894 MHz) and
   1900-MHz (1850-1990 MHz) bands. A parasitic whip antenna is used to
   improve the performance of the PIFA, especially when the handset is used
   against the human head. In such a whip-PIFA combination environment, the
   retracted whip will degrade the PIFA performance if it is not designed
   carefully. The purpose of this paper is to present an efficient method
   to optimize the PIFA performance when the whip antenna is in the
   retracted position. (C) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a reduction scheme for multivector fields
   phrased in terms of L-infinity-morphisms. Using well-known geometric
   properties of the reduced manifolds, we perform a Taylor expansion of
   multivector fields, which allows us to build up a suitable deformation
   retract of differential graded Lie algebras (DGLAs). We first obtained
   an explicit formula for the L-infinity-projection and -inclusion of
   generic DGLA retracts. We then applied this formula to the deformation
   retract that we constructed in the case of multivector fields on reduced
   manifolds. This allows us to obtain the desired reduction
   L-infinity-morphism. Finally, we perform a comparison with other
   reduction procedures.},

Title = {Correction of the Scientific Production: Publisher Performance
   Evaluation Using a Dataset of 4844 PubMed Retractions},
Journal = {PUBLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background. Retraction of problematic scientific articles after
   publication is one of the mechanisms for correcting the literature
   available to publishers. The market volume and the busi-ness model
   justify publishers' ethical involvement in the post-publication quality
   control (PPQC) of human-health-related articles. The limited information
   about this subject led us to analyze Pub-Med-retracted articles and the
   main retraction reasons grouped by publisher. We propose a score to
   appraise publisher's PPQC results. The dataset used for this article
   consists of 4844 Pub-Med-retracted papers published between 1.01.2009
   and 31.12.2020. Methods. An SDTP score was constructed from the dataset.
   The calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article
   exposure time (ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose
   retraction is initiated by the edi-tor/publisher/institution without the
   authors' participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles
   available online and the clarity of the retraction notes), and precision
   (mention of authors' responsibility and percentage of retractions for
   reasons other than editorial errors). Results. The 4844 retracted
   articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average
   number of retracted articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers
   have more than 10 retracted articles, holding 88\% of all papers and
   79\% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows
   that less than 7\% of PubMed dataset journals retracted at least one
   article. Only 10.5\% of the retraction notes included the individual
   responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the
   largest number of retracted articles in 2020. Retraction-reason analysis
   shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the
   articles' ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73
   months (images), and 10 and 42 months (plagiarism and overlap). The SDTP
   score shows, from 2018 to 2020, an improvement in PPQC of four
   publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th
   place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive
   evolution of the SDTP score. Conclusions. Publishers have to get
   involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of
   scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for
   retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC
   can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature.},

Title = {Research misconduct in health and life sciences research: A systematic
   review of retracted literature from Brazilian institutions},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Background
   Measures to ensure research integrity have been widely discussed due to
   the social, economic and scientific impact of research integrity. In the
   past few years, financial support for health research in emerging
   countries has steadily increased, resulting in a growing number of
   scientific publications. These achievements, however, have been
   accompanied by a rise in retracted publications followed by concerns
   about the quality and reliability of such publications.
   Objective
   This systematic review aimed to investigate the profile of medical and
   life sciences research retractions from authors affiliated with
   Brazilian academic institutions. The chronological trend between
   publication and retraction date, reasons for the retraction, citation of
   the article after the retraction, study design, and the number of
   retracted publications by author and affiliation were assessed.
   Additionally, the quality, availability and accessibility of data
   regarding retracted papers from the publishers are described.
   Methods
   Two independent reviewers searched for articles that had been retracted
   since 2004 via PubMed, Web of Science, Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (BVS)
   and Google Scholar databases. Indexed keywords from Medical Subject
   Headings (MeSH) and Descritores em Ciencias da Saude (DeCS) in
   Portuguese, English or Spanish were used. Data were also collected from
   the Retraction Watch website (www.retractionwatch.com). This study was
   registered with the PROSPERO systematic review database
   (CRD42017071647).
   Results
   A final sample of 65 articles was retrieved from 55 different journals
   with reported impact factors ranging from 0 to 32.86, with a median
   value of 4.40 and a mean of 4.69. The types of documents found were
   erratum (1), retracted articles (3), retracted articles with a
   retraction notice (5), retraction notices with erratum (3), and
   retraction notices (45). The assessment of the Retraction Watch website
   added 8 articles that were not identified by the search strategy using
   the bibliographic databases. The retracted publications covered a wide
   range of study designs. Experimental studies (40) and literature reviews
   (15) accounted for 84.6\% of the retracted articles. Within the field of
   health and life sciences, medical science was the field with the largest
   number of retractions (34), followed by biological sciences (17). Some
   articles were retracted for at least two distinct reasons (13). Among
   the retrieved articles, plagiarism was the main reason for retraction
   (60\%). Missing data were found in 57\% of the retraction notices, which
   was a limitation to this review. In addition, 63\% of the articles were
   cited after their retraction.
   Conclusion
   Publications are not retracted solely for research misconduct but also
   for honest error. Nevertheless, considering authors affiliated with
   Brazilian institutions, this review concluded that most of the retracted
   health and life sciences publications were retracted due to research
   misconduct. Because the number of publications is the most valued
   indicator of scientific productivity for funding and career progression
   purposes, a systematic effort from the national research councils,
   funding agencies, universities and scientific journals is needed to
   avoid an escalating trend of research misconduct. More investigations
   are needed to comprehend the underlying factors of research misconduct
   and its increasing manifestation.},

Abstract = {While researchers with retracted papers - publications that are
   withdrawn because of significant errors or scientific misconduct - carry
   a permanent stain on their publishing records, understanding the causes
   and initiators of such retractions can shed a different light on the
   matter. This paper, based on a random sample of 2,046 retracted papers,
   which were published between 1975 and 2019, extracted from Retraction
   Watch and the websites of major publishers, shows that 53\% of the
   retraction notices do not specify who initiated the retraction. Nearly
   10\% of the retraction notes either omit or do not contain information
   related to reasons for retractions. Furthermore, most of the retracted
   papers in our sample have no limitation section; those who do are
   commonly unhelpful or irrelevant. The results carry three implications
   for scientific transparency: retraction notices need to be more
   informative; limitation sections ought to be a required and even an open
   section of all published articles; and finally, promoting `heroic acts'
   in science can positively change the current publishing culture.},

Abstract = {Let n denote a positive integer. We describe the absolute retracts for
   the following five categories of finite lattices: (1) slim semimodular
   lattices, which were introduced by G. Gratzer and E. Knapp in (Acta.
   Sci. Math. (Szeged), 73 445-462 2007), and they have been intensively
   studied since then, (2) finite distributive lattices (3) at most
   n-dimensional finite distributive lattices, (4) at most n-dimensional
   finite distributive lattices with cover-preserving
   \{0,1\}-homomorphisms, and (5) finite distributive lattices with
   cover-preserving \{0,1\}-homomorphisms. Although the singleton lattice
   is the only absolute retract for the first category, this result has
   paved the way to some other classes. For the second category, we prove
   that the absolute retracts are exactly the finite boolean lattices; this
   generalizes a 1979 result of J. Schmid. For the third category and also
   for the fourth, the absolute retracts are the finite boolean lattices of
   dimension at most n and the direct products of n nontrivial finite
   chains. For the fifth category, the absolute retracts are the same as
   those for the second category. Also, we point out that in each of these
   classes, the algebraically closed lattices and the strongly
   algebraically closed lattices (investigated by J. Schmid and, in several
   papers, by A. Molkhasi) are the same as the absolute retracts.},

Abstract = {The number of retracted scientific articles has been increasing. Most
   retractions are associated with research misconduct, entailing financial
   costs to funding sources and damage to the careers of those committing
   misconduct. We sought to calculate the magnitude of these effects. Data
   relating to retracted manuscripts and authors found by the Office of
   Research Integrity (ORI) to have committed misconduct were reviewed from
   public databases. Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and
   publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed
   misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to
   misconduct accounted for approximately \$58 million in direct funding by
   the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1\% of the NIH budget over this
   period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of \$392,582 in
   direct costs (SD \$423,256). Researchers experienced a median 91.8\%
   decrease in publication output and large declines in funding after
   censure by the ORI.},

Abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed the rising prevalence of both
   co-publishing and retraction. Focusing on research collaboration, this
   paper utilizes a unique dataset to investigate factors contributing to
   retraction probability and elapsed time between publication and
   retraction. Data analysis reveals that the majority of retracted papers
   are multi-authored and that repeat offenders are collaboration prone.
   Yet, all things being equal, collaboration, in and of itself, does not
   increase the likelihood of producing flawed or fraudulent research, at
   least in the form of retraction. That holds for all retractions and also
   retractions due to falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism (FFP). The
   research also finds that publications with authors from elite
   universities are less likely to be retracted, which is particularly true
   for retractions due to FFP. China stands out with the fastest retracting
   speed compared to other countries. Possible explanations, limitations,
   and policy implications are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present ReTracker, an open-source plugin for tracking
   retracted scientific journal articles. ReTracker helps Zotero users
   detect any papers in their current libraries that were retracted on
   PubMed. At its first release, ReTracker plugin adds metadata for each
   entry on its ``retraction status{''} as the plugin performs local cache
   checking and sends a query to the tool's database. If there is a match
   in the paper's full title between the query and ReTracker's database,
   the retraction status metadata will be updated. We believe that
   ReTracker, as an open-source, free tool, is a necessary solution that is
   distinctive from existing tools (e.g. Open Retractions, CrossMark,
   etc.), in that it enables researchers to manage their existing citation
   libraries without extra efforts to repetitively search for and manually
   flag retracted papers from external database(s). With future releases,
   the tool aims to expand its functionalities in terms of standardizing
   retraction tags, adding retraction data for other item types, and
   providing pop-up notices for web browser plugins.},

Abstract = {In the battle for better science, the research community must
   obliterate, at times, works from the publication record, a process known
   as retraction. Additionally, publications and papers accumulate an
   altmetric attention score, which is a complementary metric to
   citation-based metrics. We used the citations, Journal Impact Factor,
   time between publication and retraction and the reasons behind
   retraction in order to find determinants of the retracted papers
   altmetric attention score. To find these determinants we compared two
   samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one
   of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random. We used
   a binary choice model to estimate the probability of being retracted due
   to misconduct or error. The model shows positive effects of altmetric
   scores and the time between publication and retraction on the
   probability to be retracted due to misconduct in the top sample. We
   conclude that there is an association between retraction due to
   misconduct and higher altmetric attention scores within the top sample.},

Abstract = {Fraud in medical publications is an increasing concern. In particular,
   disciplines related to perioperative medicine-including anaesthesia and
   critical care-currently hold the highest rankings in terms of retracted
   papers for research misconduct. The dominance of this dubious
   achievement is attributable to a limited number of researchers who have
   repeatedly committed scientific fraud. In the last three decades, six
   researchers have authored 421 of the 475 papers retracted in
   perioperative medicine. This narrative review reports on six cases of
   fabricated publication in perioperative medicine that resulted in the
   paper's retraction. The process that led to the unveiling of the fraud,
   the impact on clinical practice, and changes in regulatory mechanisms of
   scientific companies and governmental agencies' policies are also
   presented. Fraud in medical publications is a growing concern that
   affects perioperative medicine requiring a substantial number of papers
   to be retracted. The continuous control elicited by readers, by local
   institutional review boards, scientific journal reviewers, scientific
   societies and government agencies can play an important role in
   preserving the `pact of trust' between authors, professionals and
   ultimately the relationship between doctors and patients.},

Abstract = {Recently, an article by Seneff et al. entitled ``Innate
   immunosuppression by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations: The role of
   G-quadruplexes, exosomes, and MicroRNAs{''} was published in Food and
   Chemical Toxicology (FCT). Here, we describe why this article, which
   contains unsubstantiated claims and misunderstandings such as ``billions
   of lives are potentially at risk{''} with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, is
   problematic and should be retracted. We report here our request to the
   editor of FCT to have our rebuttal published, unfortunately rejected
   after three rounds of reviewing. Fighting the spread of false
   information requires enormous effort while receiving little or no credit
   for this necessary work, which often even ends up being threatened. This
   need for more scientific integrity is at the heart of our advocacy, and
   we call for large support, especially from editors and publishers, to
   fight more effectively against deadly disinformation.},

Title = {A compression of digital images derived from a Khalimsky topological
   structure},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL \& APPLIED MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {The paper introduces the notion of A-retract to compress digital images
   derived from a Khalimsky topological structure. Compared with a
   Khalimsky retract, an A-retract is very flexible and efficient for the
   process of compressing (or thinning) (see Fig. 10). More precisely, to
   study digital images (or spaces) derived from a Khalimsky topological
   structure, a Khalimsky continuous map and a Khalimsky homeomorphism have
   been often used in digital topology. However, these maps are so rigid
   that they have some limitations of both a rotation and a parallel
   translation from the viewpoint of geometry (see Examples 3.4, 4.1 and
   5.1 as motivating examples). To overcome these limitations, the paper
   generalizes a Khalimsky continuous map, a Khalimsky adjacency map and a
   homeomorphism between Khalimsky topological spaces so that we can
   establish new maps such as an A-map and an A-isomorphism. Using these
   notions, we can substantially study and classify digital images induced
   by a Khalimsky topological structure (see the table in Fig. 5 explaining
   some merits of an A-map compared with both a Khalimsky continuous map
   and a Khalimsky adjacency map). As an application, for digital images
   derived from a Khalimsky topological structure , the paper proposes a
   method of thinning or compressing by using an A-retract of , which shows
   that this approach can contribute to computer science such as image
   analysis, image processing, computer graphics, mathematical morphology
   and so forth.},

Title = {Does retraction after misconduct have an impact on citations? A pre-post
   study},
Journal = {BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {11},
Abstract = {Background Retracted articles continue to be cited after retraction, and
   this could have consequences for the scientific community and general
   population alike. This study was conducted to analyse the association of
   retraction on citations received by retracted papers due to misconduct
   using two-time frames: during a postretraction period equivalent to the
   time the article had been in print before retraction; and during the
   total postretraction period. Methods Quasiexperimental, pre-post
   evaluation study. A total of 304 retracted original articles and
   literature reviews indexed in MEDLINE fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
   Articles were required to have been published in a journal indexed in
   MEDLINE from January 2013 through December 2015 and been retracted
   between January 2014 and December 2016. The main outcome was the number
   of citations received before and after retraction. Results were broken
   down by journal quartile according to impact factor and the most cited
   papers during the preretraction period were specifically analysed.
   Results There was an increase in postretraction citations when compared
   with citations received preretraction. There were some exceptions
   however: first, citations received by articles published in
   first-quartile journals decreased immediately after retraction (p<0.05),
   only to increase again after some time had elapsed; and second,
   postretraction citations decreased significantly in the case of articles
   that had received many citations before their retraction (p<0.05).
   Conclusions The results indicate that retraction of articles has no
   association on citations in the long term, since the retracted articles
   continue to be cited, thus circumventing their retraction.},

Title = {A systematic review of retracted publications in emergency medicine},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-23},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize retracted publications
   in emergency medicine. We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane
   Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all retracted
   publications in the field of emergency medicine. We also searched an
   independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific
   publications. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts
   and full text of search results. Data from all included studies were
   then independently extracted. We identified 28 retraction notes. Eleven
   (39\%) articles were published by authors from Europe. The oldest
   retracted article was published in 2001. The 28 retracted papers were
   published by 22 different journals. Two authors were named on multiples
   retractions. The median impact factor of journals was 1.03 (0.6-1.9).
   Almost all studies were available online {[}26/28 (93\%)], but only 40\%
   had watermarking on the article. The retraction notification was
   available for all articles. Three (11\%) retraction notices did not
   clearly report the retraction reasons, and most retraction notices were
   issued by the editors {[}14 (56\%)]. The most frequent retraction
   reasons were plagiarism {[}eight (29\%)], duplicate publication {[}three
   (11\%)] and overlap {[}two (2\%)]. Retracted articles were cited on
   average 14 times. In most cases, the retraction cause did not invalidate
   the study's results {[}17 (60\%)]. The most common reason for retraction
   was related to a misconduct by the authors. These results can question
   the necessity to normalize retraction procedures among the large number
   of biomedical editors and to educate future researchers on research
   integrity. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Let K{[}x, y] be the polynomial algebra in two variables over a field K
   of characteristic 0. A subalgebra R of K{[}x, y] is called a retract if
   there is an idempotent homomorphism (a retraction, or projection) phi :
   K{[}x, y] --> K{[}x, y] such that phi(K{[}x, y]) = R. The presence of
   other, equivalent, definitions of retracts provides several different
   methods of studying and applying them, and brings together ideas from
   combinatorial algebra, homological algebra, and algebraic geometry. In
   this paper, we characterize all the retracts of K{[}x, y] up to an
   automorphism, and give several applications of this characterization, in
   particular, to the well-known Jacobian conjecture.},

Abstract = {Wicking is one of the important factors that cause the internal short of
   Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and directly restrict the pitch of holes.
   In this paper, orthogonal experimental design method is used to study
   the effect of five drilling parameters on the wicking. The five factors
   are rotation speed, feeding speed, retracting speed, drill life and
   stack number. The result shows that the order of the influencing factors
   is as follows: stack number, drill life, rotation speed, retracting
   speed, feeding speed. It is found that the optimum parameters
   combination is rotation speed of 150 kr/min, feeding speed of 38 mm/sec,
   retracting speed of 280 mm/sec, drill life of 1600 hits and stack number
   of 1 PNL/stack.},

Title = {Reducing the Inadvertent Spread of Retracted Science: recommendations
   from the RISRS report},
Journal = {RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND PEER REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Background Retraction is a mechanism for alerting readers to unreliable
   material and other problems in the published scientific and scholarly
   record. Retracted publications generally remain visible and searchable,
   but the intention of retraction is to mark them as ``removed{''} from
   the citable record of scholarship. However, in practice, some retracted
   articles continue to be treated by researchers and the public as valid
   content as they are often unaware of the retraction. Research over the
   past decade has identified a number of factors contributing to the
   unintentional spread of retracted research. The goal of the Reducing the
   Inadvertent Spread of Retracted Science: Shaping a Research and
   Implementation Agenda (RISRS) project was to develop an actionable
   agenda for reducing the inadvertent spread of retracted science. This
   included identifying how retraction status could be more thoroughly
   disseminated, and determining what actions are feasible and relevant for
   particular stakeholders who play a role in the distribution of
   knowledge. Methods These recommendations were developed as part of a
   year-long process that included a scoping review of empirical literature
   and successive rounds of stakeholder consultation, culminating in a
   three-part online workshop that brought together a diverse body of 65
   stakeholders in October-November 2020 to engage in collaborative problem
   solving and dialogue. Stakeholders held roles such as publishers,
   editors, researchers, librarians, standards developers, funding program
   officers, and technologists and worked for institutions such as
   universities, governmental agencies, funding organizations, publishing
   houses, libraries, standards organizations, and technology providers.
   Workshop discussions were seeded by materials derived from stakeholder
   interviews (N = 47) and short original discussion pieces contributed by
   stakeholders. The online workshop resulted in a set of recommendations
   to address the complexities of retracted research throughout the
   scholarly communications ecosystem. Results The RISRS recommendations
   are: (1) Develop a systematic cross-industry approach to ensure the
   public availability of consistent, standardized, interoperable, and
   timely information about retractions; (2) Recommend a taxonomy of
   retraction categories/classifications and corresponding retraction
   metadata that can be adopted by all stakeholders; (3) Develop best
   practices for coordinating the retraction process to enable timely,
   fair, unbiased outcomes; and (4) Educate stakeholders about pre- and
   post-publication stewardship, including retraction and correction of the
   scholarly record. Conclusions Our stakeholder engagement study led to 4
   recommendations to address inadvertent citation of retracted research,
   and formation of a working group to develop the Communication of
   Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern (CORREC) Recommended
   Practice. Further work will be needed to determine how well retractions
   are currently documented, how retraction of code and datasets impacts
   related publications, and to identify if retraction metadata (fails to)
   propagate. Outcomes of all this work should lead to ensuring retracted
   papers are never cited without awareness of the retraction, and that, in
   public fora outside of science, retracted papers are not treated as
   valid scientific outputs.},

Title = {A Force-Visualized Silicone Retractor Attachable to Surgical Suction
   Pipes},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper presents a force-visually-observable silicone retractor,
   which is an extension of a previously developed system that had the same
   functions of retracting, suction, and force sensing. These features
   provide not only high usability by reducing the number of tool changes,
   but also a safe choice of retracting by visualized force information.
   Suction is achieved by attaching the retractor to a suction pipe. The
   retractor has a deformable sensing component including a hole filled
   with a liquid. The hole is connected to an outer tube, and the liquid
   level displaced in proportion to the extent of deformation resulting
   from the retracting load. The liquid level is capable to be observed
   around the surgeon's fingertips, which enhances the usability. The new
   hybrid structure of soft sensing and hard retracting allows the
   miniaturization of the retractor as well as a resolution of less than
   0.05 N and a range of 0.1-0.7 N. The overall structure is made of
   silicone, which has the advantages of disposability, low cost, and easy
   sterilization/disinfection. This system was validated by conducting
   experiments.},

Abstract = {During the past twenty years, more than ninety retraction notices have
   been published in biomedical journals. These retractions constitute a
   unique body of literature that biomedical researchers, bibliographers,
   and librarians must monitor to reduce scientific use of retracted,
   invalid papers. An analysis of medical retraction notices shows that
   very few are prominent in style, format, or placement, in spite of
   authoritative publication standards formulated by the International
   Council of Medical journal Editors. Although researchers are ultimately
   responsible for the validity of the information they cite in their own
   publications, biomedical librarians are in a unique position to educate
   their patrons regarding retracted papers.},

Title = {Proposal of a Single-Trocar Assemblable Hand for Laparoscopic Surgery},
Journal = {ADVANCED ROBOTICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {25},
Number = {13-14},
Pages = {1713-1728},
Abstract = {Large instruments are not suitable for laparoscopic surgery because they
   cannot pass through trocars, which are typically less than 12 mm in
   diameter; however, operating on large internal organs with a slender
   instrument is often difficult. To overcome this limitation, we have
   proposed an `assemblable instrument', whose parts are inserted through
   trocars and assembled inside the abdominal cavity to form a large
   instrument. We have previously reported the development of assemblable
   hands that require two trocars for assembly. In this paper, we propose a
   simple three-fingered hand whose function is limited to retracting or
   grasping, but whose assembly requires a single trocar. We develop two
   types of finger units: one for a retracting hand and the other for a
   grasping hand. The two finger units can be connected to a single main
   unit of the hand. We conduct in vivo experiments. The retracting hand
   can retract several large internal organs and lift up the stomach with
   its three fingers from the bottom. The grasping hand can grasp the
   spleen stably with its two fingers from the bottom. (C) Koninklijke

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel relax-and-retract algorithm is proposed to tackle
   the nonconvex unit-modulus constraint in the joint intelligent
   reflecting surface (IRS) and multiuser multiple-input multiple-output
   (MU-MIMO) transceiver design. The conventional method to tackle the
   unit-modulus constraint is semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and its
   computational complexity is large. By using the symbol detection mean
   square error (MSE) as the quality of service (QoS), the proposed
   relax-and-retract approach enables us to get convex quadratically
   constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) subproblems, which have a much
   lower computational complexity than the conventional SDR approach.
   Simulation results show that the proposed relax-and-retract approach has
   excellent performance in terms of computational complexity, while the
   transmit power and the unit-modulus hardware implementation are the same
   as those of the SDR approach.},

Abstract = {There are three main reasons for retraction: (1 ethical misconduct (e.g.
   duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB, ownership
   issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process, citation
   manipulation); (2 scientific distortion (e.g. data manipulation,
   fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable data validity,
   non-replicability, data errors - even if unintended); 3) administrative
   error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the final version
   published, publisher errors). The first category, although highly
   deplorable has no effect on the advancement of science, the third
   category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the second
   category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view, as they
   are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on
   science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal
   characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication,
   years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and
   social media attention by the three major categories. The data set
   comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from

Abstract = {We aimed to quantify the number of pre- and post-retraction citations
   obtained by genetics articles retracted due to research misconduct. All
   retraction notices available in the Retraction Watch database for
   genetics articles published in 1970-2016 were assessed. The reasons for
   retraction were fabrication/falsification and plagiarism. The endpoints
   were the number of citations of retracted articles and when and how
   journals reported on retractions and whether this was published on
   PubMed.
   Four hundred and sixty retracted genetics articles were cited 34,487
   times; 7,945 (23\%) were post-retraction citations. Median time to
   retraction and time to last citation were 3.2 and 3 years, respectively.
   Most (96\%) had a PubMed retraction notice, One percent of these were
   totally removed from journal websites altogether, and 4\% had no
   information available on either the online or PDF versions. Ninety
   percent of citations were from articles retracted due to
   falsification/fabrication. The percentage of post-retraction citations
   was significantly higher in the case of plagiarism (42\%) than in the
   case of fabrication/falsification (21.5\%) (p<0.001). Median time to
   retraction was shorter (1.3 years) in the case of plagiarism than for
   fabrication/falsification (4.8 years, p<0.001). The retraction was more
   frequently reported in the PDFs (70\%) for the fabrication/falsification
   cases than for the plagiarism cases (43\%, p<0.001). The highest rate of
   retracted papers due to falsification/fabrication was among authors in
   the USA, and the highest rate for plagiarism was in China.
   Although most retractions were appropriately handled by journals, the
   gravest issue was that median time to retraction for articles retracted
   for falsification/fabrication was nearly 5 years, earning close to 6800
   post-retraction citations. Journals should implement processes to
   speed-up the retraction process that will help to minimize
   post-retraction citations.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Scientific articles are retracted at increasing rates, with the highest
   rates among top journals. Here we show that a single retraction triggers
   citation losses through an author's prior body of work. Compared to
   closely-matched control papers, citations fall by an average of 6.9\%
   per year for each prior publication. These chain reactions are sustained
   on authors' papers (a) published up to a decade earlier and (b)
   connected within the authors' own citation network by up to 4 degrees of
   separation from the retracted publication. Importantly, however,
   citation losses among prior work disappear when authors self-report the
   error. Our analyses and results span the range of scientific
   disciplines.},

Abstract = {Dynamic knowledge processing in PROLOG is currently done using
   assert/retract predicates. The first consequence of such a facility is
   that those predicates put once again the declarativeness of the PROLOG
   language in the wrong. Morever, a second consequence, as we will see in
   this paper, is that the consistency of the PROLOG programs that use such
   predicates is no more guaranteed. To solve this last class of problems,
   we introduce a new vision of assert/retract predicates in the PLEASE
   system.},

Abstract = {Let alpha : Q -> Q be an involution of a Hilbert cube with fixed point
   set Q(alpha) that has Property Z in Q. The first main result of this
   paper is Theorem 3.1: Assume that (Q, alpha) is an absolute retract in
   the category of metric spaces with involutions and equivariant maps. If
   T subset of Q is an equivariant retract of Q containing Q(alpha) that is
   an inequivariant Z-set in Q, then for any equivariant retraction r : Q
   -> T, Q is equivariantly homeomorphic with the mapping cylinder M (r; T)
   of r reduced at T. The second main result is part of Theorem 3.3:
   Q(alpha) is an equivariant strong deformation retract of Q if and only
   if Q is equivariantly homeomorphic with Q(alpha) x Pi I-i >= 1(i)
   equipped with the involution that reflects each interval coordinate I-i

Title = {Retraction of publications: a study of biomedical journals retracting
   publications based on impact factor and journal category},
Journal = {GACETA SANITARIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the biomedical journal characteristics that are
   associated with the retraction of papers.
   Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. All papers
   retracted and indexed in PubMed from January 1st, 2013 to December 31st,
   2016 were included. We used nine main categories to classify
   retractions: aspects related with data, authors issues, plagiarism,
   unethical research, journal issues, review process, conflict of
   interest, other, and unknown. These categories were further classified
   as: misconduct, suspicion of misconduct, or no misconduct.
   Results: The proportion of retraction was 2.5 per 10,000 publications.
   Retractions appeared in 611 journals. During the study period,
   retraction due to misconduct was more frequent among journals with
   low-impact factor. Within these retracted publications, among low-impact
   journals the presence of misconduct was higher with a 73\% compared to
   61\% for the high-impact journals (p=0.001). There were differences in
   the percentage of retractions due to misconduct regarding the journal
   classification category (p <0.001).
   Conclusions: Retraction of publications is present in both high- and
   low-impact factor biomedical journals, but misconduct is more frequent
   among the papers retracted from lower impact journals. Measures before
   and after publication should be taken to limit misconduct. (C) 2019

Abstract = {In this paper, we first introduce the concepts of Bregman nonexpansive
   retract and Bregman one-local retract and then use these concepts to
   establish the existence of common fixed points for Banach operator pairs
   in the framework of reflexive Banach spaces. No compactness assumption
   is imposed either on C or on T, where C is a closed and convex subset of
   a reflexive Banach space E and is a Bregman nonexpansive mapping. We
   also establish the well-known De Marr theorem for a Banach operator
   family of Bregman nonexpansive mappings.

Title = {Anisotropic behaviours of droplets impacting on dielectrowetting

Journal = {SOFT MATTER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2621-2628},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {The spreading of a sessile droplet on a solid substrate is enhanced if a
   non-uniform electric field is applied at the contact-line region. This
   so-called dielectrowetting effect holds great potential in controlling
   the spreading of droplets by varying the strength of the electric field.
   In this paper, we experimentally and theoretically study the effect of
   the dielectrowetting on the dynamics of droplets impacting on a solid
   surface having electrodes to impose the non-uniform electric field to
   the liquid. We experimentally study the anisotropic behaviours in both
   the spreading and retracting stages: the droplets spread more but
   retract with significantly smaller rates in the direction parallel to
   the electrodes. We provide a theoretical explanation for the spreading
   enhancement caused by dielectrowetting by decoupling it from
   inertia-induced spreading. We also theoretically account for the
   reduction in retraction rate using force balance at the contact line.
   The theoretical analysis in both the spreading and retracting stages is
   verified experimentally.},

Title = {Effects of Retracting Velocities on the Vibration of Atomic Force
   Microscope Probe on Different Surfaces},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VIBRATION ENGINEERING \& TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1305-1315},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose During atomic force microscope operation, electrostatic,
   capillary, and van der Waals forces contribute significantly to AFM
   tip-sample interaction. This paper presents the effects of probe
   retracting velocities on the tip-sample interaction and reveals the
   discrepancies of the interaction measured from the surfaces of different
   hardness and wettability. Methods In this work, the effects of
   retracting velocities on probe vibration were studied by simultaneously
   investigating variation of the force, amplitude, and phase with vertical
   displacement (f-d, a-d and p-d curves) upon AFM tip leaving a silicon
   surface. The same measurement was also conducted on the samples of
   different hardness and wettability to investigate their effects on the
   interaction. Results It is found that the slopes of the f-d, a-d or p-d
   curves decrease with the increase of retracting velocity. In addition,
   the slope of the a-d curve collected on the hydrophilic silicon surface
   presents an abrupt change during the amplitude increase. Besides, the
   amplitude and phase have a long changing process with probe displacement
   when the probe is retracted from a polyvinyl chloride surface.
   Conclusion The results indicate that the increase in the velocity causes
   the tip-sample interaction to decrease more slowly with the probe
   displacement, and the interaction is greater as the probe retracts from
   soft or hydrophilic surface under the same conditions. The study
   provides an opportunity for deeper understanding tip-sample interaction
   and may shed new light on comparing the hardness and wettability of
   materials through investigating AFM probe vibrations.},

Abstract = {Mobile platforms equipped with several steering wheels are known to be
   omnidirectional, i.e., able to independently translate and rotate on the
   plane. As an improvement to this design, the Justin mobile platform also
   possesses the ability to vary its footprint over time by
   extending/retracting the wheel legs during motion. In this paper, we
   discuss the kinematic modeling and control issues for such a platform.
   The goal is to obtain a tracking controller which is able to realize an
   arbitrary linear/angular platform motion while, at the same time,
   independently expanding/retracting each leg. Experimental results
   support the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {End mills are widely employed in cutting applications, but there is lack
   of standard grinding process. Thus the main purpose of this paper is to
   plan the grinding processes of end mills, including approach and retract
   sequence of each axis, and grinding parameters, etc. A tool grinding CAM
   system was applied to set appropriate parameters in order to find out
   the optimal approach and retract distance, and the sequence. In the
   experiments, a five-axis CNC tool grinder was utilized to grind a square
   end mill and a ball nose end mill with two flutes to verify the
   efficiency for the saving of time. Experimental results show that the
   efficiency was improved approximately up to 40\% by the approach and
   retract time, and the overall machining time, 10\%. Therefore, the
   results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed processes for the
   saving of machining time. They also can be applied to grind different
   shapes of cutting tools. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   discussion is on the case where K is a compact neighborhood retract of E
   with nontrivial Euler characteristic. The class of such sets includes
   convex sets as well as numerous types of non convex sets; e.g. sets
   that; are bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to convex sets, epi-Lipschitz sets
   in arbitrary dimension, certain unions of spheres or balls, etc. The
   inwardness conditions are expressed in terms of the tangent cone of
   non-smooth analysis for neighborhood retracts with Lipschitzian behavior
   and in terms of retraction cones for more general neighborhood retracts.
   Existence of zeros subject to a weaker analytical inwardness condition
   is also discussed based on the Browder-Ky Fan fixed point theorem.},

Journal = {SCIENCE EDITING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Purpose: Although retractions are commonly considered to be negative,
   the fact remains that they play a positive role in the academic
   community. For instance, retractions help scientific enterprise perform
   its self-correcting function and provide lessons for future researchers;
   furthermore, they represent the fulfillment of social responsibilities,
   and they enable scientific communities to offer better monitoring
   services to keep problematic studies in check. This study aims to
   provide a thorough overview of the practice of retraction in scientific
   publishing from the first incident to the present.
   Methods: We built a database using SQL Server 2016 and homemade
   artificial intelligence tools to extract and classify data sources
   including RetractionWatch, official publishers' archives, and online
   communities into ready-to-analyze groups and to scan them for new data.
   After data cleaning, a dataset of 18,603 retractions from 1,753 (when
   the first retracted paper was published) to February 2019, covering 127
   research fields, was established.
   Results: Notable retraction events include the rise in retracted
   articles starting in 1999 and the unusual number of retractions in 2010.
   The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Elsevier, and
   Springer account for nearly 60\% of all retracted papers globally, with
   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers contributing the most
   retractions, even though it is not the organization that publishes the
   most journals. Finally, reasons for retraction are diverse but the most
   common is ``fake peer review{''}.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that the frequency of retraction has
   boomed in the past 20 years, and it underscores the importance of
   understanding and learning from the practice of retracting scientific
   articles.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, several major scientific fraud cases have
   shocked the scientific community. The number of retractions each year
   has also increased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and
   scientific misconduct accounts for more than half of those retractions.
   It is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their
   colleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide
   empirical evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research
   on co-authors' research careers. Using data from the Web of Science, we
   measured the productivity, impact, and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors
   of 293 retracted articles for a period of 5 years before and after the
   retraction. We found clear evidence that collaborators do suffer
   consequences of their colleagues' misconduct and that a retraction for
   fraud has higher consequences than a retraction for error. Our results
   also suggest that the extent of these consequences is closely linked
   with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted paper, being felt most
   strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors, with the impact
   is less important for middle authors.},

Title = {Research on the springback of thin-walled tube NC bending based on the

Abstract = {The whole process of thin-walled tube NC bending includes three
   processes: bending tube, retracting mandrel and springback. Based on the
   numerical simulation of the whole process, the springback mechanism and
   rule of thin-walled tube NC bending are revealed. During springback, the
   angle of the bending portion decreases and the radius of the bending
   portion increases. The springback of the two straight portions is
   similar to the bending deformation of a projecting beam. The total
   springback angle considering retracting mandrel is much smaller than
   that not considering retracting mandrel and the maximum difference
   between them in the paper is 107.34\%. The process of retracting mandrel
   must be considered to predict accurately the springback of thin-walled
   tube NC bending. The total springback angle increases linearly with the
   increase of the bending angle when the bending angle is big. The
   springback radius can be obtained based on that the length of the
   neutral layer keeps unchangeable during springback. The length change of
   the bending portion during springback is usually very small so that it
   can be neglected when the springback radius is computed. And then the
   springback radius is independent on the bending angle and the linearly
   increasing rate of the total springback angle with the increase of the
   bending angle can be used to compute the springback radius. (C) 2007

Abstract = {While a systematic review is meant to provide a high-quality appraisal
   of the evidence regarding a healthcare intervention, the conclusions are
   predicated on the reliability of the included studies {[}1]. The
   existence of unreliable or problematic studies in the literature
   presents difficulties for researchers performing systematic reviews and
   jeopardizes the credibility of their results. Retracted studies have the
   most obvious flaws. Retraction is defined as the removal of a published
   paper from a journal to warn readers of the significant problems
   identified in the article as a means of maintaining the integrity of
   scientific literature {[}2]. Including retracted studies in a systematic
   review may impact the outcomes and level of evidence, and ultimately
   provide inaccurate medical guidelines {[}3,4]. Thus, handling retracted
   studies in systematic reviews is a critical issue.
   Recently, we discovered that one of the studies cited in a systematic
   review and meta-analysis (SRMA) {[}5], which was accepted through the
   peer review process in the Korean Journal of Anesthesiology (KJA), was
   confirmed to have been retracted during the proofreading stage. Given
   the ambiguous timing, several rounds of editorial discussions were
   necessary to thoroughly consider the options regarding how to proceed.
   The KJA editorial board made a concerted effort to perform peer review
   and editorial assessment in a robust, transparent, and credible manner
   regarding this disputed SRMA {[}6].},

Abstract = {To improve robots' mobility on flat ground and rough terrain, we
   designed and implemented a novel spherical robot with a combined rolling
   and leaping capability. The robot has two individually driven
   semi-spheres, which generate rolling and turning motions. The robot also
   has a five-bar linkage with a release/retract mechanism for leaping. The
   release/retract mechanism only uses one DOF to control and switch the
   mechanism in three different stages: retracting, maintaining, and
   releasing. In this paper, the dynamics of the robot in rolling and
   leaping are analyzed. The robot was empirically built, and its
   performance was experimentally evaluated. The results confirm that the
   robot can leap close to 25.4 cm diameter of the sphere, which, to the
   best of our knowledge, is the best among reported spherical robots. The
   robot can also leap while rolling over a 14 cm barrier, which is equal
   to 1.14 times the sphere's radius.},

   opportunity to examine whether scientists write differently when
   reporting on fraudulent research. In an analysis of over two million
   words, we evaluated 253 publications retracted for fraudulent data and
   compared the linguistic style of each paper to a corpus of 253
   unretracted publications and 62 publications retracted for reasons other
   than fraud (e.g., ethics violations). Fraudulent papers were written
   with significantly higher levels of linguistic obfuscation, including
   lower readability and higher rates of jargon than unretracted and
   nonfraudulent papers. We also observed a positive association between
   obfuscation and the number of references per paper, suggesting that
   fraudulent authors obfuscate their reports to mask their deception by
   making them more costly to analyze and evaluate. This is the first
   large-scale analysis of fraudulent papers across authors and disciplines
   to reveal how changes in writing style are related to fraudulent data
   reporting.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the topology of a wormhole from the

   equatorial geodesics on the line element of the wormhole and discuss the
   minimum deformation retract related to this space. Using the Lagrangian
   equations we find that there is a type of minimum retraction of a
   wormhole with associated topology. We also extend the result to the
   n-dimensional wormhole and show that the end limit of var-folding is
   0-dimensional wormhole and obtain the relation between limit var-folding
   and limit retraction. We find a new application in geometric topology
   and astrophysics.},

Abstract = {Prolog is the most; well-known and widely used logic programming
   language. A large number of Prolog applications maintains information by
   asserting and retracting clauses from the database. Such dynamic
   predicates raise a number of issues for Prolog implementations, such as
   what are the semantics of a procedure where clauses can be retracted and
   asserted while the procedure is being executed. One advantage of Logical
   Update semantics is that it allows indexing. In this paper, we discuss
   how one call implement just-in-time indexing with Logical Update
   semantics. Our algorithm is based on two ideas: stable structure and
   fragmented index trees. By stable structure one means that we define a
   structure for the indexing tree that not change, even as we assert and
   as we retract clauses. Second, by fragmented index tree we mean that the
   indexing tree will be built in such a way that the updates will be local
   to each fragment. The algorithm was implemented and results indicate
   significant speedups and reduction of memory usage in test applications.},

Title = {Effect of annealing ambient on anisotropic retraction of film edges
   during solid-state dewetting of thin single crystal films},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {120},
Number = {7},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {During solid-state dewetting of thin single crystal films, film edges
   retract at a rate that is strongly dependent on their crystallographic
   orientations. Edges with kinetically stable in-plane orientations remain
   straight as they retract, while those with other in-plane orientations
   develop in-plane facets as they retract. Kinetically stable edges have
   retraction rates that are lower than edges with other orientations and
   thus determine the shape of the natural holes that form during
   solid-state dewetting. In this paper, measurements of the retraction
   rates of kinetically stable edges for single crystal (110) and (100) Ni
   films on MgO are presented. Relative retraction rates of kinetically
   stable edges with different crystallographic orientations are observed
   to change under different annealing conditions, and this accordingly
   changes the initial shapes of growing holes. The surfaces of (110) and
   (100) films were also characterized using low energy electron
   diffraction, and different surface reconstructions were observed under
   different ambient conditions. The observed surface structures were found
   to correlate with the observed changes in the relative retraction rates
   of the kinetically stable edges. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {A retract of a graph is an induced subgraph of such that there exists a
   homomorphism from to whose restriction to is the identity map. A graph
   is a core if it has no nontrivial retracts. In general, the minimal
   retracts of a graph are cores and are unique up to isomorphism; they are
   called the core of the graph. A graph is G-symmetric if G is a subgroup
   of the automorphism group of that is transitive on the vertex set and
   also transitive on the set of ordered pairs of adjacent vertices. If in
   addition the vertex set of admits a nontrivial partition that is
   preserved by G, then is an imprimitive G-symmetric graph. In this paper
   cores of imprimitive symmetric graphs of order a product of two distinct
   primes are studied. In many cases the core of is determined completely.
   In other cases it is proved that either is a core or its core is
   isomorphic to one of two graphs, and conditions on when each of these
   possibilities occurs is given.},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether negative citations in articles and
   comments posted on post-publication peer review platforms are both
   equally contributing to the correction of science. These 2 types of
   written evidence of disputes are compared by analyzing their occurrence
   in relation to articles that have already been retracted or corrected.
   We identified retracted or corrected articles in a corpus of 72,069
   articles coming from the Engineering field, from 3 journals (Science,
   Tumor Biology, Cancer Research) and from 3 authors with many retractions
   to their credit (Sarkar, Schon, Voinnet). We used Scite to retrieve
   contradicting citations and PubPeer to retrieve the number of comments
   for each article, and then we considered them as traces left by
   scientists to contest published results. Our study shows that
   contradicting citations are very uncommon and that retracted or
   corrected articles are not more contradicted in scholarly articles than
   those that are neither retracted nor corrected but they do generate more
   comments on Pubpeer, presumably because of the possibility for
   contributors to remain anonymous. Moreover, post-publication peer review
   platforms, although external to the scientific publication process
   contribute more to the correction of science than negative citations.
   Consequently, post-publication peer review venues, and more specifically
   the comments found on it, although not contributing to the scientific
   literature, are a mechanism for correcting science. Lastly, we
   introduced the idea of strengthening the role of contradicting citations
   to rehabilitate the clear expression of judgment in scientific papers.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel adaptive mode switching scheme for
   hypersonic morphing aircraft with retracted winglets based on type-2
   Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy sliding mode control. For each of
   retracting and stretching modes, a specific sliding mode controller has
   been adopted. Drawing upon input/output linearization to globally
   linearize the nonlinear model of the hypersonic aircraft at first, a
   type-2 TSK fuzzy logic system is devised for robust mode switching
   between these sliding mode controllers. For rapid stabilization of the
   system, the adaptive law for mode switching is designed using a direct
   constructive Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the
   stability and smooth transition using the proposed switched control
   scheme.},

Abstract = {Acyclic cubical complexes have first been introduced by Bandelt and
   Chepoi in analogy to acyclic simplicial complexes. They characterized
   them by cube contraction and elimination schemes and showed that the
   graphs of acyclic cubical complexes are retracts of cubes characterized
   by certain forbidden convex subgraphs. In this paper we present an
   algorithm of time complexity O(m log n) which recognizes whether a given
   graph G on n vertices with m edges is the graph of an acyclic cubical
   complex. This is significantly better than the complexity O(m root n) of
   the fastest currently known algorithm for recognizing retracts of cubes
   in general. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY},

Pages = {179-203},
Abstract = {We investigate graded retracts of polytopal algebras (essentially the
   homogeneous rings of affine cones over projective toric varieties) as
   polytopal analogues of vector spaces. In many cases we show that these
   retracts are again polytopal algebras and that codimension 1 retractions
   factor through retractions preserving the semigroup structure. We expect
   that these results hold in general.
   This paper is a part of the project started by the authors in 1999,
   where we investigate the graded automorphism groups of polytopal
   algebras. Part of the motivation comes from the observation that there
   is a reasonable `polytopal' generalization of linear algebra (and,
   subsequently, that of algebraic K-theory).},

Note = {6th International Symposium on Domain Theory (ISDT), Campus Hunan Univ,

Abstract = {In 1978, G. Plotkin noticed that T-omega, the cartesian product of omega
   copies of the three element flat domain of Booleans, is a universal
   domain, where `universal' means that the retracts of T-omega for Scott's
   continuous semantics are exactly all the omega CC-domains, which with
   Scott continuous functions form a cartesian closed category. As usual,
   `omega' is for `countably based,' and here `CC' is for `conditionally
   complete,' which essentially means that any subset which is pairwise
   bounded has a least upper bound. Since T-omega is also an omega
   DI-domain (an important structure in stable domain theory), the
   following problem arises naturally: is there a cartesian closed category
   C of domains with stable functions such that T-omega, or a related
   structure, is universal in C for Berry's stable semantics? The aim of
   this paper is to answer this question. We first investigate the
   properties of stable retracts. We introduce a new class of domains
   called conditionally complete DI-domains (CCDI-domain for short) and
   show that, (1) T-omega is an omega CCDI-domain and the category of
   CCDI-domains (resp.omega CCDI-domains) with stable functions is
   cartesian closed; (2) {[}T-omega ->(st) T-omega] is a stable universal
   domain in the sense that every omega CCDI-domain is a stable retract of
   {[}T-omega -> (st) T-omega], where {[}T-omega -> (st) T-omega] is the
   stable function space of T-omega; (3) in particular, {[}T-omega ->(st)
   T-omega] is not a stable retract of T-omega and hence T omega is not
   universal for Berry's stable semantics. We remark that this paper is a
   completion and correction of our earlier report in the Proceedings of
   the 6th International Symposium on Domain Theory and Its Applications
   (ISDT2013).},

Abstract = {There are three main reasons for retraction: (1) ethical misconduct
   (e.g. duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB,
   ownership issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process,
   citation manipulation); (2) scientific distortion (e.g. data
   manipulation, fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable
   data validity, non-replicability, data errors-even if unintended); (3)
   administrative error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the
   final version published, publisher errors). The first category, although
   highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science,
   the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the
   second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view,
   as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only
   on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal
   characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication,
   years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and
   social media attention by the three major categories. The data set
   comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from
   Elsevier's ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were
   retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine
   post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for
   Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts
   and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction.},

Abstract = {Pneumatically operated soft growing robots that extend via tip eversion
   are well-suited for navigation in confined spaces. Adding the ability to
   interact with the environment using sensors and tools attached to the
   robot tip would greatly enhance the usefulness of these robots for
   exploration in the field. However, because the material at the tip of
   the robot body continually changes as the robot grows and retracts, it
   is challenging to keep sensors and tools attached to the robot tip
   during actuation and environment interaction. In this paper, we analyze
   previous designs for mounting to the tip of soft growing robots, and we
   present a novel device that successfully remains attached to the robot
   tip while providing a mounting point for sensors and tools. Our tip
   mount incorporates and builds on our previous work on a device to
   retract the robot without undesired buckling of its body. Using our tip
   mount, we demonstrate two new soft growing robot capabilities: (1)
   pulling on the environment while retracting, and (2) retrieving and
   delivering objects. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our design
   and opportunities for improvement in future soft growing robot tip
   mounts.},

Title = {Retraction of publications in nursing and midwifery research: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {8-13},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Rates of manuscript retraction in academic journals are
   increasing. Papers are retracted because of scientific misconduct or
   serious error. To date there have been no studies that have examined
   rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery journals.
   Design: A systematic review of Journal Citation Report listed nursing
   science journals.
   Data sources: The Medline database was searched systematically from
   January 1980 through July 2017, and www.retractionwatch.com was manually
   searched for relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria.
   Review methods: Two researchers undertook title and abstract and full
   text screening. Data were extracted on the country of the corresponding
   author, journal title, impact factor, study design, year of retraction,
   number of citations after retraction, and reason for retraction.
   Journals retraction index was also calculated.
   Results: Twenty-nine retracted papers published in nursing science
   journals were identified, the first in 2007. This represents 0.029\% of
   all papers published in these journals since 2007. We observed a
   significant increase in the retraction rate of 0.44 per 10,000
   publications per year (95\% CI; 0.03-0.84, p=.037). There was a negative
   association between a journal's retraction index and impact factor with
   a significant reduction in retraction index of -0.57 for a one-point
   increase in impact factor (95\% CI;-1.05 to -0.09, p=.022). Duplicate
   publication was the most common reason for retraction (n=18, 58\%). The
   mean number of citations manuscripts received after retraction was
   seven, the highest was 52. Most (n=27, 93.1\%) of the retracted papers
   are still available online (with a watermark indicating they are
   retracted).
   Conclusion: Compared to more established academic disciplines, rates of
   retraction in nursing and midwifery are low. Findings suggest that
   unsound research is not being identified and that the checks and
   balances incumbent in the scientific method are not working. In a
   clinical discipline, this is concerning and may indicate that research
   that should have been removed from the evidence base continues to
   influence nursing and midwifery care.},

Abstract = {We draw on rational crime theory to help analyse 55 articles that have

   retractions and the policy guidelines of publishers regarding retracted
   papers. We conclude that the frequent vagueness of retraction
   statements, and a reluctance to signal research malpractice, generally
   results in little damage to the reputation of caught, and known,
   offenders. Thus, a key deterrent to engaging in research malpractice is
   lacking. To reduce the incidence of research malpractice, we offer
   several recommendations for publishers and journal editors.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a pressure sensor aimed at spine surgery, which is
   attached to a nerve root retractor. To study the effects of excessive
   nerve root retraction due to the surgeon improper operation, a nerve
   root retractor equipped with a pressure sensor is utilized in animal
   experiments to assess the pressure applied on the retracted nerve root.
   Meanwhile, the nerve root being retracted is stimulated and the
   neuromuscular response owing to the stimulation signal is monitored. The
   pressure exerted upon the nerve root is related to the neuromuscular
   response through the results of the experiments. The pressure could be a
   function of the retraction's duration and degree, which is benefit for
   applying suitable pressure on a nerve root.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a new kind of optimal design model and methodology for
   large flexible antenna in space with deployed and retracted states are
   investigated. The purpose is to search for a minimum weight design by
   means of selecting the cables' tension and cross-sectional areas of the
   surround truss whilst satisfying the constraints such as, for deployed
   state, the precision of reflector surface, material strength,
   eigenfrequency and variables sides, and, for retracted state, the
   stowage volume, eigenfrequency, material strength and variables sides.
   To solve the problem, an improved genetic algorithm (GAs) is proposed
   and applied to a 17-m-diameter antenna with reasonable result, which is
   currently under design and manufacturing in China.},

Title = {Avoidance of Cutter Retracting Interference in Noncircular Gear Shaping

Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Gear shaping, a widely used machining method for circular gears, was
   generalized to noncircular gears in recent works using a 3-linkage
   machine tool. As the pitch curve normals of noncircular gears change
   constantly in processing, angles may exist between the pitch curve
   normals and the cutter relieving direction, bringing in turn cutter
   retracting interference.
   Regarding this, the paper proposes a 4-linkage shaping method. Through
   linkage motion of 4 machine tool axes, noncircular gear pitch normals
   are along the cutter relieving direction, avoiding completely cutter
   retracting interference. On such basis, a mathematical model is first
   established, the cutting process is then discussed and a cutting
   experiment is finally carried out, proving the validity of the proposed
   method.},

Abstract = {The article entitled, ``Identification of prognosis biomarkers of
   prostatic cancer in a cohort of 498 patients from TCGA,{''} by Chen Z
   and Hu H. (J Comput Biol Dec 2019: e-pub ahead of print; DOI:
   10.1089/cmb.2019.0224) is being officially retracted at the authors'
   request due to errors found in the data after publication of the
   article. The detected errors render the results and conclusion
   irreproducible, and therefore, invalid.
   Based on the communications received from the authors, the editorial
   leadership of Journal of Computational Biology agreed to retract the
   published paper.
   However, after retracting the article, it was also discovered that the
   same article had been previously published in volume 43, issue 6 of the
   journal, Current Problems in Cancer, published by Elsevier. The
   publisher of Journal of Computational Biology was in communication with
   Elseivier since simultaneous submission and/or publication is a
   violation of the proper protocols of peer review, and they are
   conducting their own evaluation. Journal of Computational Biology also
   notified the authors' institution of the infraction.
   Journal of Computational Biology, its Editor, and its Publisher are
   committed to preserving the integrity of the scientific record for the
   community it serves.},

Abstract = {In this article, we show and discuss the results of a quantitative and
   qualitative analysis of open citations of retracted publications in the
   humanities domain. Our study was conducted by selecting retracted papers
   in the humanities domain and marking their main characteristics (e.g.,
   retraction reason). Then, we gathered the citing entities and annotated
   their basic metadata (e.g., title, venue, subject) and the
   characteristics of their in-text citations (e.g., intent, sentiment).
   Using these data, we performed a quantitative and qualitative study of
   retractions in the humanities, presenting descriptive statistics and a
   topic modeling analysis of the citing entities' abstracts and the
   in-text citation contexts. As part of our main findings, we noticed that
   there was no drop in the overall number of citations after the year of
   retraction, with few entities that have either mentioned the retraction
   or expressed a negative sentiment toward the cited publication. In
   addition, on several occasions, we noticed a higher concern/awareness by
   citing entities belonging to the health sciences domain about citing a
   retracted publication, compared with the humanities and social science
   domains. Philosophy, arts, and history are the humanities areas that
   showed higher concern toward the retraction.},

   Rajaram; American Geophysical Union; and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The
   retraction has been agreed because the electron pitch angle data
   presented were contaminated by internally produced photoelectrons as a
   result of the illumination geometry of the sensor at the time of the
   observations. After removal of the affected angular bins by the
   instrument principal investigator, the published conclusions were found
   to be invalid. Therefore, the paper was retracted at the request of the
   authors.},

Abstract = {In a publication that appeared in 2005 (Diem et al., Mutat. Res.
   583:178-183){[}10] harmful effects (DNA breakage) were reported to occur
   in rat and human cells after exposure to mobile-phone electromagnetic
   fields. The extremely low standard deviations in this paper, and in
   another publication by the same group of authors, prompted Vijayalaxmi
   to write a critical comment {[}Mutat. Res. 603 (2006)104-1061]{[}6]. An
   investigation by the Medical University of Vienna (Austria) was
   initiated by a letter by the first author of the present paper, based on
   the data contained in the reply by the authors {[}Riidiger et al.,
   Mutat. Res. 603 (2006)107-109]{[}17]. The University published three
   press releases, stating that ``the data were not measured
   experimentally, but fabricated{''} and that the Mutation Research paper
   and another, published by the International Archives of Occupational and
   Environmental Health (IAOEH) in 2008, should be retracted. So far,
   neither of these papers has been retracted. Only a Letter of Concern by
   the Editors of IAOEH, and an Editorial by Mutation Research were
   published. Here we describe the statistical methods used to identify the
   evidence of data fabrication. The major point is the small variation in
   the reported data, which is below the theoretical lower limit derived
   from multinomial distributions and also lower than those derived from
   detailed simulations. Another reason for doubt was the highly
   significant non-equal distribution of last digits, a known hint towards
   data fabrication. In view of the results of the University's
   investigation and the evidence presented in this paper, the Diem et al.
   (2005) {[}10] publication should be retracted, with or without the
   authors' agreement. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Bucciarelli, Piperno, and Salvo give a mapping of the strongly

   result and provide a converse. We shall do this by retracting untyped
   terms with surjective pairing onto untyped terms without pairing by
   using a special variant of Stovring's notion {[}8] of a symmetric term.
   The symmetric ones which have simple types with Cartesian products are
   precisely the ones which retract onto (eta expansions of) strongly
   normalizable untyped terms. The intersection types of the strongly
   normalizable terms are related to the simple types with products in that
   we just replace. by Cartesian product and vice versa.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Retractions of scientific articles represent attempts to
   correct the literature. Our goal was to examine retracted surgical
   papers.
   Methods: NCBI PubMed database was queried using the search terms
   ``surgery,{''} ``surg,{''} or ``surgical{''} and ``retracted{''} or
   ``retraction.{''} Article details were recorded.
   Results: There were 184 retracted surgical articles identified from 1991
   through 2015. Average retraction time was 3.6 years. General (26\%),
   Cardiac (22\%), and Orthopedic (10\%) surgery were most common. Reasons
   for retraction were duplication (35.3\%), Institutional Review Board
   violations (18.5\%), falsified data (14.7\%), data errors (9.8\%),
   author dispute (8.2\%), plagiarism (7.6\%), copyright violations
   (2.2\%), financial disclosure violations (0.5\%), and consent (0.5\%).
   No reason for retraction was given in 8.7\% of cases. Median IF was
   higher for administrative than content-related retraction reasons (3.0
   vs. 2.0, P < 0.01). A paywall, requiring a subscription to read,
   restricted access to 23.4\% of retraction notices.
   Conclusions: Article retractions occur across all fields of surgery for
   various reasons, both administrative and content-related. The majority
   of surgical retraction notices have a reason for retraction listed and
   do not require payment to read. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {In forestry, the Pterocarpus genus is important for the wood industry as
   this is a tree that is highly valued for its timber. Biotechnological
   research on this tree genus therefore needs to be carefully examined,
   even at the post-publication stage. In this paper, we examine how a
   near-duplicate copy of a 2004 paper published in a leading plant science
   and biotechnology Springer Nature journal, In Vitro Cellular and
   Developmental Biology-Plant, was corrected, rather than retracted. The
   near-duplicate paper has been cited a total of 16 times, according to
   the Web of Science, and since 2015, when the paper was first corrected,
   four citations have emerged. These additional citations for the
   corrected paper support our claim that the corrected paper should have
   been retracted, i.e., that the literature was insufficiently corrected,
   which may have prevented the citation of this near-duplicate paper.
   Readers who cited the near-duplicate paper after the erratum had been

Title = {MIMO radar design with joint constant-modulus and any p-norm similarity
   constraints},
Journal = {DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {137},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {MIMO radar plays a key role in many applications, e.g., autonomous
   driving, smart parking, and gesture recognition. The similarity waveform
   constraint is an important constraint for radar waveform design.
   However, the joint constant-modulus and similarity constraints pose a
   big challenge in MIMO radar design. Only the special case with oo-norm
   similarity and constant-modulus constraints is tackled by the
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the successive quadratic refinement
   (SQR) methods. In this paper, the joint constant-modulus and any p-norm
   (1 < p < oo) similarity constraints are tackled by the proposed
   relax-and-retract algorithm. In particular, the nonconvex
   constant-modulus constraint is first relaxed to a convex constraint, and
   then the retract operation is guaranteed to recover a constant-modulus
   solution within a fixed iteration number. Extensive simulation results
   show that full range similarity control and constant-modulus constraints
   are satisfied under different p-norms. For the special case with 1-norm,
   it is firstly found to be a constant-modulus-inducing norm. For the
   special case with oo-norm, the proposed relax-and-retract method has
   less computational complexity than the SDR and SQR approaches. (c) 2023

Title = {Authorship Issues When Articles are Retracted Due to Research Misconduct
   and Then Resubmitted},
Journal = {SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the last 20 years, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence
   of retractions of articles published in scientific journals, the
   majority of which are due to research misconduct. In some cases,
   researchers have revised and republished articles that were retracted
   due to misconduct, which raises some novel questions concerning
   authorship. Suppose that an article is retracted because one of the
   authors fabricated or falsified some data, but the researchers decide to
   salvage the useable data, make appropriate revisions, and resubmit the
   article for publication. If the person who committed misconduct has made
   a significant contribution to the research reported in the revised
   paper, should they be named as an author to recognize this contribution
   or should they be denied authorship because they committed misconduct?
   This is a challenging issue because it involves the confluence of two
   research ethics domains that are usually dealt with separately, i.e.,
   resolution of authorship disputes and adjudication of misconduct
   findings, as well as potential conflicts among norms that underlie
   authorship practices and misconduct adjudication. In this paper, we (1)
   describe some actual cases involving articles that were retracted for
   misconduct and republished; (2) review policies from the International
   Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Committee on Publication Ethics,
   and top fifteen biomedical journals to determine whether they provide
   adequate guidance for cases like these; and (3) analyze the ethical and
   policy issues that may arise in these situations.},

Abstract = {Many otologic surgeries, including cochlear implantation and
   mastoidectomy, require a post-auricular incision for exposure. The
   auricle must be retracted forward in order to enable an unobstructed
   view of the surgical field and improve procedural outcomes. Typical
   methods of securing the ear include tape, a small stitch, or an
   assistant's finger, depending on surgeon preference. In this paper, we
   propose a novel design for a tool that retracts the auricle safely,
   effectively, and consistently with the appropriate tension for closure
   of a post-auricular incision. The tool attaches to the helix with a
   compression fit, and then anchors between the triangular fossa and the
   helical crus. The tool's efficacy is demonstrated through a test fit and
   comparison to standard methods. This anchoring tool enables the surgeon
   to refract the pinna easily and effectively.},

   roles. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has
   been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area
   for research. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years
   in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include
   the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal
   logic, deontic logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured
   representations. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors
   to better specify, monitor, and test software systems for compliance.},

Title = {Comprehensive Analysis of Retracted Publications in Dentistry: A 23-Year
   Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {Background. In the modern tech-savvy era, scientific literature
   publication remains the optimal way to disperse knowledge, even if it
   has transformed from print to mostly electronic. With the new and
   improved publication methods, also come more scrutiny and analytic
   criticism of the scientific work. It becomes even more important in this
   context to rectify flawed scientific work responsibly. This present
   study was undertaken to help clarify the process and causes of
   retractions occurring in the dental community and analyse its reasons.
   Methodology. A total of 8092 PubMed indexed articles were scanned from
   the online libraries, and individually scanning for author details,
   place of study, subspecialty of research, funding, dates of original
   publication, and retraction notices issued along with journal specifics
   such as type and impact factors, country of publishing was compiled and
   analysed by two authors. The dataset was then collaboratively analysed
   using Panda's Library in Python software as an analysis tool for data
   preparation and for frequency analysis. The estimates were presented as
   mean differences (MD) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Results.
   The present study had a compiled dataset of 198 articles after screening
   and revealed that maximum retractions of dentistry-related research
   originated from India (25.3\%) and, on average, took 2.6 years to be
   issued a retraction notice. We also deciphered that the USA retracted
   maximum dental articles (34.8\%), and plagiarism was cited as the most
   common (38.02\%) reason for doing so. The present study also brought to
   light that there was a trend for lower impact factor-dental journals in
   retracting maximum articles, most of which were nonfunded (62.16\%). The
   results signify that 63.78\% of all retracted papers continued to be
   cited postretractions. Conclusions. The retractions happening in the
   field of dental literature are currently too time-consuming and often
   unclear to the readers. The authors would like to conclude that the
   retracted papers were mostly from India and Spain mostly related to
   endodontics or prosthodontic research. All of this warrants the need for
   better scrutiny and reforms in the area.},

Abstract = {Retractions of scientific papers published by some Iran-affiliated
   scientists in the preceding decade have attracted much attention and
   publicity; however, the reasons for these retractions have not been
   documented. We searched the Retraction Watch Database to enumerate the
   retracted Iran-affiliated papers from December 2001 to December 2019 and
   aimed to outline the predominant reasons for retractions. The reasons
   included fake peer-review, authorship dispute, fabricated data,
   plagiarism, conflict of interest, erroneous data, and duplication. The
   Fisher's exact test was used to investigate the associations between
   retractions and their underlying reasons. We selected P < 0.05 to
   indicate the statistically significant differences. We found 697
   retracted papers. Duplication (27\%), plagiarism (26\%), and fake
   peer-review (21\%) were the most frequent reasons for retractions. Our
   study highlights the importance of urgent intervention to prevent the
   misconduct and questionable research practices that lead to retractions
   in Iran. Continually educating the scientists and postgraduate students
   about the ethics and norms of scientific publishing is an important
   measure to ensure publication of reliable, worthy, and impactful papers.},

Abstract = {An automaton A is called a retractable automaton if, for every sub
   automaton B of A, there is at least one homomorphism of A onto B which
   leaves the elements of B fixed (such homomorphism is called a retract
   homomorphism of A onto B). We say that a retractable automaton
   A=(A,X,delta) is Boolean -type if there exists a family \{lambda(B)
   vertical bar B is a subautomaton of A\} of retract homomorphisms
   lambda(B) of A such that, for arbitrary subautomata B-1 and B-2 of A,
   the condition B-1 subset of B-2 implies Ker lambda(B2) subset of Ker
   lambda(B1). In this paper, we describe the Boolean -type retractable
   state-finite automata without outputs.},

Abstract = {Article retraction in research is rising, yet retracted articles
   continue to be cited at a disturbing rate. This paper presents an
   analysis of recent retraction patterns, with a unique emphasis on the
   role author self-cites play, to assist the scientific community in
   creating counter-strategies. This was accomplished by examining the
   following: (1) A categorization of retracted articles more complete than
   previously published work. (2) The relationship between citation counts
   and after-retraction self-cites from the authors of the work, and the
   distribution of self-cites across our retraction categories. (3) The
   distribution of retractions written by both the author and the editor
   across our retraction categories. (4) The trends for seven of our nine
   defined retraction categories over a 6-year period. (5) The average
   journal impact factor by category, and the relationship between impact
   factor, author self-cites, and overall citations. Our findings indicate
   new reasons for retractions have emerged in recent years, and more
   editors are penning retractions. The rates of increase for retraction
   varies by category, and there is statistically significant difference of
   average impact factor between many categories. 18 \% of authors
   self-cite retracted work post retraction with only 10 \% of those
   authors also citing the retraction notice. Further, there is a positive
   correlation between self-cites and after retraction citations.},

Abstract = {There is an increasing amount of research investigating retractions. Yet
   little attention has been paid to the relationship between retractions
   and collaboration. In this paper, we test the hypotheses regarding the
   relationship between retractions and collaboration on a unique
   publication dataset of retractions and its control group constructed by
   the nearest-neighbor-matching approach. Our analysis finds no
   significant evidence indicating that collaboration suffers from
   producing flawed research, at least in the form of retraction. We also
   find that ceteris paribus publications with authors from elite
   universities are less likely but more quickly to be retracted. There
   also is no significant impact of collaboration size on the speed of
   retraction of Chinese articles, although China stands out with the
   fastest retracting speed. Our findings have policy implications for the
   governance of global science, especially that involves collaboration.},

Abstract = {An increasing problem throughout the world, plagiarism and related
   dishonest behaviors have been affecting Indian science for quite some
   time. To curb this problem, the Indian government has initiated a number
   of measures, such as providing plagiarism detecting software to all the
   universities for free. Still, however, many unfair or incorrect papers
   are published. For some time, publishers have used an efficient tool to
   deal with such situations: retractions. A published paper that is later
   discovered to not deserve publicationwhich can be for a number of
   reasonscan be withdrawn (and often removed from the online contents of
   the journal) by the publisher. This study aims (1) to identify retracted
   publications authored orco-authored by researchers affiliated to Indian
   institutions and (2) to analyze the reasons for the retractions. To meet
   these aims, we searched the SCOPUS database to identify retraction
   notices for articles authored or coauthored by Indian authors. The first
   retraction notice was issued back in 1996, an exceptionally early
   retraction, as the next one was published in 2005. Thus, we analyzed 239
   retractions (195 from journals and 44 from conference proceedings)
   published between 2005 and 3 August 2018 (but most were published after
   2010), in terms of the following qualitative retraction-wise parameters:
   the main reason for retraction, authorship, a collaboration level,
   collaborating countries, sources of retraction (a journal or conference
   proceedings), and funding sources of the research. We also detected
   journals with high retraction frequencies. Mainly two phrasesRetraction
   notice to and Retracted Articlewere used to retract publications. The
   most frequent reason for retractions was plagiarism.},

Abstract = {The present paper examines reports by `retractors' (i.e. adults who have
   retracted their earlier claims of childhood abuse) to explore
   suggestions in the literature of possible similarities between their
   experiences and the experiences of individuals who falsely confess to
   criminal acts. Despite concerns about the reliability of retractors'
   reports, these individuals provide valuable insight. into the processes
   involved in making and then repudiating claims of abuse, The present
   analysis revealed similarities between the contexts in which retractors
   came to report that they were sexually abused and the contexts in which
   false confessions arise. Although caution must be taken in generalizing
   from these findings, these similarities indicate that models of false
   confession could serve as a useful basis for conceptualizing the
   processes involved in the development of claims of childhood sexual
   abuse that are subsequently retracted.},

Abstract = {Context: Fraudulent publication is a scourge of scientific research.
   Objectives: This scoping review was aimed at characterizing retracted
   publications for fraud or plagiarism in the field of anesthesia. Does
   the reputation of the journal (Quartile and Impact Factor, IF) protect
   the reader from the risk of having the manuscript he read withdrawn for
   fraud/plagiarism?
   Methods/Design: This scoping review was planned following the Joanna
   Briggs Institute recommendations. Data sources: PubMed and the
   Retraction Watch Database
   (http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?).
   Study selection: All types of publications retracted. Data extraction:
   Year, first author nationality, journal name, journal category, IF,
   Quartile, H index.
   Data analysis: The association with Quartile and IF was investigated.
   Results: No significant association between retraction of papers
   published in no-Quartile journals and retractions published in journals
   placed in the highest quartile.
   Conclusions: The quality of the surveillance in paper submission is not
   higher in journals of the first Quartile than in journals not placed in
   other Quartiles. (The protocol was prospectively registered in the Open
   Science Framework https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TGKNE)},

Abstract = {Motivated by the ever increasing pursuit of science with the transient
   sky (dubbed Time Domain Astronomy or TDA), we are fabricating and will
   commission a new deployable tertiary mirror for the Keck I telescope
   (K1DM3) at the W.M. Keck Observatory. This paper presents the detailed
   design of K1DM3 with emphasis on the optomechanics. This project has
   presented several design challenges. Foremost are the competing
   requirements to avoid vignetting the light path when retracted against a
   sufficiently rigid system for high-precision and repeatable pointing.
   The design utilizes an actuated swing arm to retract the mirror or
   deploy it into a kinematic coupling. The K1DM3 project has also required
   the design and development of custom connections to provide power,
   communications, and compressed air to the system. This NSF-MRI funded
   project is planned to be commissioned in Spring 2017.},

Abstract = {Science is increasingly a team activity, and the size of the teams has
   been growing. At the same time, there are concerns about an increasing
   rate of pathologies in science. The growth of team science suggests the
   need to look beyond individual-level explanations and focus on
   organizational structures and institutional contexts to explain
   pathologies in science. Drawing on the literature on organizational
   pathologies, we argue that division of labor may be a key factor
   contributing to pathologies in science. Furthermore, we examine the
   effects of high-stakes incentives and of institutional corruption as
   additional predictors of scientific pathologies. Using retractions as an
   indicator of pathologies, and drawing on a matched sample of 195
   retracted papers and 349 paired papers that were not retracted, we
   develop indicators of the division of labor in the team that produced a
   paper and find that the rate of retractions is higher as the division of
   labor increases (net of team size). Additionally, we find that
   high-stakes incentives and institutional corruption are also associated
   with increased retractions. We conclude with a discussion of the
   implications of these findings for science policy, in particular for
   organizing team science projects},

Abstract = {In laparoscopic surgery large instruments cannot be used because they
   cannot pass through trocars which are typically smaller than 12mm in
   diameter. For example, retracting an internal organ with a slender
   instrument is often a difficult task. To remove this limitation, we have
   proposed ``assemblable instruments{''}, that is, parts are inserted
   through trocars and assembled inside the abdominal cavity to become a
   large instrument and we have developed assemblable hands. However they
   use two trocars for assembling, which require positioning and alignment
   of two assembled parts. This paper presents a simple three fingered hand
   whose function is limited to retracting. We propose a much simpler
   assembling method ``single trocar assembling{''} for the hand.
   Experimental results verify that the hand can be assembled easily and
   that it can withstand a force of 25N enough to rectract a pancreas.},

Abstract = {Let X be a pathwise connected topological space and let X1 and X2 be two
   closed pathwise connected homeomorphic subspaces.  An elementary proof
   is given that, provided X1 and X2 have disjoint open neighbourhoods and
   one of the spaces X1 and X2 is a strong deformation retract of its
   neighbourhood, the relation between the fundamental group of X and the
   space obtained by identifying X1 and X2 is the same as that discovered
   by van Kampen for less general conditions as a generalisation of an
   earlier theorem of Seifert.  The relation also holds for nonclosed X1
   and X2, if X is covered by the interior points of the complement of X1
   or X2 and the neighbourhoods of these spaces.  Two counter-examples for
   this relation showing that local conditions are required are also
   presented in this paper.  Also, this paper contains a discussion of
   additional properties for a neighbourhood deformation retract X1 that
   ensure that `'collapsing a handle defined as trivial I-bundle'' will
   induce a (weak) homotopy equivalence and it discusses relevant
   counter-examples.},

Title = {A bifurcation study to guide the design of a landing gear with a
   combined uplock/downlock mechanism},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {470},

Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the insights that a bifurcation analysis can
   provide when designing mechanisms. A model, in the form of a set of
   coupled steady-state equations, can be derived to describe the
   mechanism. Solutions to this model can be traced through the mechanism's
   state versus parameter space via numerical continuation, under the
   simultaneous variation of one or more parameters. With this approach,
   crucial features in the response surface, such as bifurcation points,
   can be identified. By numerically continuing these points in the
   appropriate parameter space, the resulting bifurcation diagram can be
   used to guide parameter selection and optimization. In this paper, we
   demonstrate the potential of this technique by considering an aircraft
   nose landing gear, with a novel locking strategy that uses a combined
   uplock/downlock mechanism. The landing gear is locked when in the
   retracted or deployed states. Transitions between these locked states
   and the unlocked state (where the landing gear is a mechanism) are shown
   to depend upon the positions of two fold point bifurcations. By
   performing a twoparameter continuation, the critical points are traced
   to identify operational boundaries. Following the variation of the fold
   points through parameter space, a minimum spring stiffness is identified
   that enables the landing gear to be locked in the retracted state. The
   bifurcation analysis also shows that the unlocking of a retracted
   landing gear should use an unlock force measure, rather than a position
   indicator, to de-couple the effects of the retraction and locking
   actuators. Overall, the study demonstrates that bifurcation analysis can
   enhance the understanding of the influence of design choices over a wide
   operating range where nonlinearity is significant.},

Abstract = {When a working cylinder of the pressing machine working cylinder was
   stuck and underwent retracted conversion, pressure shock was high in
   working cylinder cavity and flow pulsation was distinct in the pipeline
   due to the high working pressure and frequent retracted transformation
   of the working cylinder, which not only shortened the service life of
   the pressing machine, but also exerted serious impacts on the machining
   precision and quality, especially after the pressing machine applied
   loads and high-pressure oil in work rod end cavity of working cylinder
   needed to be relieved in a short time. In order to research and analyze
   the better pressure relief characteristics of the two types of pressure
   relief circuits of the pressing machine, the paper established models,
   carried out simulation and analysis and then made contrastive analysis
   of the working cylinder rod velocity, rod acceleration and port pressure
   pulsation according to the simulation results.},

Abstract = {The sensational ``reactome array{''} paper published in Science in 2009
   was investigated in Spain by the Ethics Committee of Consejo Superior de
   Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) after Science issued an editorial
   expression of concern. The paper was retracted in 2010 because of
   ``skepticism{''} due to ``errors{''} in chemistry. The ``errors{''} were
   so profound that many readers expressed doubt that they were really
   errors, but part of an elaborate hoax. I conducted a forensic analysis
   of mass spectrometry data in the paper's Supporting Online Material
   (SOM) and was able to prove that thousands of data values were in fact
   fabricated. The SOM contains signatures of improper extensive
   spreadsheet manipulations of incorrect atomic and molecular mass values
   as well as impossibly repetitive deviations of found molecular mass
   values from their expected values. No evidence of real mass spectrometry
   data was detected. Both CSIC and Science have been content to retract
   the paper without acknowledging the fabrications or assigning
   responsibility for them. Neither CSIC nor Science has expressed interest
   in having an independent investigation determining how the paper came to
   be written, reviewed and published. Their weak response to this episode
   is a daunting signal that there is an impending crisis in research
   integrity and science journalism.},

Abstract = {In a paper from 2009, a half magnetic monopole was discovered by Ausoni,
   Dundas, and Rognes. This describes an obstruction to the existence of a
   continuous map K (ku) -> B(ku{*}) with determinant like properties. This
   magnetic monopole is in fact an obstruction to the existence of a map
   from K (ku) to K (Z, 3), which is a retract of the natural map K (Z, 3)
   -> K (ku); and any sensible definition of determinant like should
   produce such a retract. In this paper we describe this obstruction
   precisely using monoidal categories. By a result from 2011 by Baas,
   Dundas, Richter and Rognes K (ku) classifies 2-vector bundles. We thus
   define the notion of oriented 2-vector bundles, which removes the
   obstruction by the magnetic monopole. We use this to define an oriented
   K-theory of 2-vector bundles with a lift of the natural map from K (Z,
   3). It is then possible to define a retraction of this map and since K
   (Z, 3) classifies complex gerbes we call this a determinant gerbe map.},

Abstract = {In 1974, Rekers and Lovaas published an article in the Journal of
   Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA) wherein the authors coached a
   4-year-old child's parents to ignore and physically abuse him when he
   engaged in behaviors that were identified by the authors as
   inappropriate for a child whose sex assigned at birth was male. In
   October 2020, a Statement of Concern regarding Rekers and Lovaas (1974)
   was published in JABA (SEAB \& LeBlanc, 2020), which described concerns
   regarding the paper and then provided justification for the journal's
   decision to not retract this paper. In this current response, I provide
   a counterpoint to the Statement of Concern, arguing that (a) the
   available evidence strongly suggests that the original study was
   unethical and misaligned with the principles of Applied Behavior
   Analysis (ABA), and (b) the evidence presented to support its
   contemporaneous ethicality is insufficient. I end with an argument that
   Rekers and Lovaas (1974) should be retracted and discuss the critical
   role of ethics and social significance for the field of ABA.},

Abstract = {In this paper the non-reacting flow in a swirl burner is studied using
   Large Eddy Simulation. The configuration consists of two unconfined
   co-annular jets at a Reynolds number of 81500. The flow is characterized
   by a Swirl number of 0.93. Two cases are studied in the paper differing
   with respect to the axial location of the inner pilot jet. It was
   observed in a companion experiment (Bender and Buchner 2005) that when
   the inner jet is retracted the flow oscillations are considerably
   amplified. This is also found in the present simulations. Large-scale
   coherent structures rotating at a constant rate are observed when the
   inner jet is retracted. The rotation of the structures leads to vigorous
   oscillations in the velocity and pressure time signals recorded at
   selected points in the flow. In addition, the mean velocities, the
   turbulent fluctuations and the frequency of the oscillations are in good
   agreement with the experiments. A conditional averaging procedure is
   used to perform a detailed analysis of the physics leading to the
   low-frequency oscillations.},

Abstract = {Coal ash obtained from the Thermal Power plants consists of a major
   portion of Flyash and less amount of Bottom ash. As a major portion of
   the coal ash, fly ash has been recognized widely as a source material
   for geopolymers while the utilization of bottom ash has received very
   less attention owing to its coarser size. Hence to promote greater
   utilisation of bottom ash in construction sector, this work proposes the
   use of ground bottom ash in geopolymer mortar. The effect of molar ratio
   of SiO2/Na2O, Na2SiO3/NaOH ratio and curing mode were studied on
   compressive strength of coal ash geopolymer mortar. Molarity of sodium
   silicate solution was kept as 8M. Ambient curing and steam curing at 60
   degrees C was attempted. Test results indicate that Na2SiO3/NaOH of
   ratio 2 with SiO2/Na2O molar ratio 1 mortar achieved higher compressive
   strength under both ambient curing and steam curing.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of
   nanofluid droplets impacting on nanostructured surfaces. Nanofluids with
   required weight concentration of 0.25-0.75 wt \% were prepared by
   dispersing TiO2 (21 nm) nanoparticles and appropriate amounts of sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant in Milli-Q water. Superhydrophobic and
   superhydrophilic coatings were applied over a silicon substrate. The
   images obtained from the high-speed camera clearly show that when a
   nanofluid droplet impacts a superhydrophobic surface at room
   temperature, it spreads, retracts, oscillates, and continues to retract
   to approximately its initial size. In addition, the increase in
   nanofluid concentration leads to a decrease in the maximum spreading and
   the height of droplets after impingement. Also, the use of nanofluids
   increases the temperature difference at the center of the droplet impact
   region. TiO2 nanoparticles improve the cooling effectiveness of the
   droplets on uncoated and superhydrophobic surface up to 33\% and 214\%,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {The internal grooved (undercut) features of plastic injection moulded
   parts are formed by collapsible cores. While collapsible cores have been
   designed for pipe sizes smaller than 90 mm in diameter, those for larger
   pipes are custom designed. The objective of this research was to fully
   automate the design procedure which, for uPVC pipe fittings is laborious
   and error-prone at present. This paper discusses the design of the four
   key geometrical features of a two-stage, lever-actuated collapsible
   core, namely, the number of segments, the path of the retracting
   segments during demoulding, the minimum angle of taper of the grooved
   undercut to permit the segments to retract during de-moulding and the
   prevention of interference between moving components. After these key
   geometrical features are established it is then possible to fully
   automate the design of two-stage, lever-actuated collapsible cores in a
   CAD system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {145-166},
Abstract = {Academic publications are too often ignored by other researchers. There
   are various reasons: Researchers know that conclusions may eventually be
   proved wrong; publications are sometimes retracted; effects may decline
   when studied later; researchers occasionally don't seem to know about
   papers they have allegedly authored; there are even accusations of fraud
   (Cohen, 2011). In this exploratory case study, 10 papers were examined
   to determine the various ways they were used by others, whether there
   were cases of reported effects declining, and whether, among those who
   referenced the papers, there were suggestions that anything in the
   papers ought to be retracted. Findings showed that all the papers had
   been referenced by others (337 user publications were found, containing
   a total of 868 references). Other findings include the following: Single
   references were far more common than multiple references;
   applications/replications were the least common type of usage (23
   occurrences), followed by contrasts/elaborations (34), and quotations
   (65); unlike reports regarding publications in the sciences, whether the
   paper was solo- or co-authored did not affect usage; appearance in a
   non-prestige journal was actually associated with more usage of some
   kinds; and well over 80\% of uses were in heavily scrutinized sources
   (journal articles or theses/dissertations). The paper concludes with
   recommendations to writers about how to avoid producing publications
   that are ignored.},

Abstract = {This article analyses 131 articles that have been retracted from
   peer-reviewed journals in business and management studies. We also draw
   from six in-depth interviews: three with journal editors involved in
   retractions, two with coauthors of papers retracted because a fellow
   author committed research fraud, and one with a former academic found
   guilty of research fraud. Our aim is to promote debate about the causes
   and consequences of research misconduct and to suggest possible
   remedies. Drawing on corruption theory, we suggest that a range of
   institutional, environmental, and behavioral factors interacts to
   provide incentives that sustain research misconduct. We explore the
   research practices that have prompted retractions. We contend that some
   widely used, but questionable research practices, should be challenged
   so as to promote stronger commitment to research integrity and to deter
   misconduct. To this end, we propose eleven recommendations for action by
   authors, editors, publishers, and the broader scientific community.},

Abstract = {A compactification alpha X of a locally compact Hausdorff space X is
   said to be singular if alpha X\textbackslash{}X is a retract of alpha X.
   Suppose that S is a class of locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff
   spaces, and that K is a collection of compact Hausdorff spaces. A
   general question about the existence of singular compactifications is
   the following: For what classes S and K is it true that each
   compactification of X is an element of S having a remainder alpha
   X\textbackslash{}X is an element of K: is singular? In this paper we
   consider a collection S, which contains the zero-dimensional spaces, and
   prove, among other things, that in this case K can be taken to be all
   products of compact metric spaces. In the process we have a variant of
   the well known result of Sierpinski that in a separable metric space X,
   a closed subset A having a zero-dimensional complement is a retract of
   X.},

Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {This work presents two versions of landing gear drives numerically
   simulated. We follow to obtain the right driving sequence of the legs
   and doors and the estimation of the landing gear deploy and retract
   time. Although the studies in this paper do not exhaust all the aspects
   concerning landing gear hydraulic system functioning, these are useful
   in the design phase of the aircraft hydraulic systems. Regarding the
   landing gear hydraulic system, we highlight one version of the drive
   stall phenomenon. When the hydraulic feeding pressure decreases, it is
   possible that the forces developed by the hydraulic cylinders are enough
   to retract completely the legs. The landing gear remains in an
   intermediate position, and the aircraft cannot accomplish its mission
   safely. For a second version, logic command functions are synthesized
   using Karnaugh diagrams, and after that, the numerical simulation is
   accomplished to validate the solution. We used the AMESim software to
   perform numerical simulations.},

Title = {Extension of continuity of maps between axiomatic locally finite spaces},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS},

Volume = {88},
Number = {14},
Pages = {2889-2900},
Abstract = {The paper studies the extension problem of continuous maps between
   axiomatic locally finite spaces (for short, ALF spaces). Indeed, an ALF
   space is a topological space satisfying a set of axioms suggested in
   Kovalevsky {[}Axiomatic digital topology, J. Math. Imag. Vis. 26 (2006),
   pp. 41-58; Geometry of Locally Finite Spaces, Monograph, Berlin, 2008].
   Further, an ALF space is defined by using a special kind of
   neighbourhood different from the topological neighbourhood in classical
   topology so that the continuity of maps between ALF spaces can be
   defined by preserving the neighbourhood relation (see Definition 10).
   Therefore, it is necessary to develop the notions of continuity,
   homeomorphism and local homeomorphism for such spaces by using the
   neighbourhood relation, which can be applicable in computer science. In
   the study of a deformation of an ALF space, we can develop a special
   kind of retract on ALF spaces. By using the retract, we can efficiently
   deal with the extension of continuous maps between ALF spaces.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a novel technique using the rotational magnetic field
   oscillation and low-intensity submegahertz ultrasound stimulation of
   magnetic microbubbles (MMBs) to promote the nanodroplets (NDs) phase
   transition and improve the permeation of NDs into the blood clot fibrin
   network to enhance the sonothrombolysis efficiency. In this study, the
   influence of different treatment methods with a combination of MMBs and
   NDs on the thrombolysis rate of both unretracted and retracted clots
   were investigated, including the stable and inertial cavitation, tPA
   effects, MMBs/NDs concentration ratio, sonication factors (input
   voltage, duty cycle) and rotational magnetic field factors (flux
   density, frequency). We demonstrated that tPA-mediated
   magneto-sonothrombolysis in combining NDs with MMBs could significantly
   enhance in vitro lysis of both unretracted clots (85 +/- 8.3\%) and
   retracted clots (57 +/- 6.5\%) in a flow model with 30 min treatment.
   The results showed that the combination of MMBs and NDs substantially
   improves in vitro lysis of blood clots with an unprecedented lysis rate.},

Abstract = {In this paper, some characterizations of median and quasi-median graphs
   are extended to general isometric subgraphs of Cartesian products using
   the concept of an imprint function as introduced by Tardif. This extends
   the well known concepts of medians in median graphs as well as imprints
   in quasi-median graphs. We introduce absolute C-median graphs in analogy
   to absolute retracts, and derive a connection with the canonical
   isometric embedding of graphs into Cartesian products. Absolute C-median
   graphs strictly include classes of irreducible graphs and absolute
   (weak) retracts as well as many median-like classes, such as weakly
   median graphs, pre-median graphs, and weakly modular graphs. New
   characterizations of quasi-median graphs and of median graphs are
   obtained along the way. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the
   amalgamation procedure for absolute C-median graphs, and prove the fixed
   box theorem for this class modulo the conjecture. (C) 2002 Academic

Abstract = {In this paper the non-reacting flow in a swirl burner is studied using
   large eddy simulation. The configuration consists of two unconfined
   coannular jets at a Reynolds number of 81,500. The flow is characterized
   by a Swirl number of 0.93. Two cases are studied in the paper differing
   with respect to the axial location of the inner pilot jet. It was
   observed in a companion experiment (Bender and Buchner 2005, Proc. 12
   Int. Cong. Sound and Vibration, Lisbon, Portugal) that when the inner
   jet is retracted the flow oscillations are considerably amplified. This
   is also found in the present simulations. Large-scale coherent
   structures rotating at a constant rate are observed when the inner jet
   is retracted. The rotation of the structures leads to vigorous
   oscillations in the velocity and pressure time signals recorded at
   selected points in the flow. In addition, the mean velocities, the
   turbulent fluctuations, and the frequency of the oscillations are in
   good agreement with the experiments. A conditional averaging procedure
   is used to perform a detailed analysis of the physics leading to the
   low-frequency oscillations.},

   Stadler and de Prada Vicente {[}Fuzzy Sets and Systems 58 (1993) 365]
   introduced a new concept of F-topological subspaces, which coincides
   with the usual definition in the case that mu = X-Y. Also, they
   introduced the concepts of F-mu-open sets and F-mu-continuity. In this
   paper, using the previous concepts, we introduce weaker forms of
   F-mu-open sets and F-mu-continuity. The notion of an F-retract was
   introduced by Rodabough {[}J. Math. Anal. Appl. 79 (1981) 273]. Here, we

Abstract = {This paper reports on the roles of three coaxial spinnerets with
   different electric field distributions, including retracting spinneret,
   flat spinneret, and protruding spinneret in the Taylor cone, jet motion,
   and resultant core shell fibers. The Taylor cone, jet motion, and the
   morphology and internal structure of resultant core shell fibers for
   these three above mentioned spinnerets are systematically studied. The
   results show that the Taylor cone, jet motion, and core shell fiber
   morphology are influenced by the electric field distribution induced by
   different spinneret structures. The retracting spinneret produces a
   thinner fiber with groove morphology due to the shorter straight jet
   length, larger envelope angle and higher whipping frequency. On the
   contrary, the protruding spinneret causes coarser and porous morphology
   fibers because of the longer straight jet length, smaller envelope
   angle, and lower whipping frequency. The jet motion has a tremendous
   influence on the fiber diameter and surface morphology; in addition, the
   internal structure of core-shell fiber is affected by the morphology of
   the Taylor cone.},

Abstract = {Casting is a manufacturing process in which liquid is poured into a cast
   (mould) that has a cavity with the shape of the object to be
   manufactured. The liquid then hardens, after which the cast is removed.
   We address geometric problems concerning the removal of the cast. A cast
   consists of two parts, one of which retracts in a given direction
   carrying the object with it. Afterwards, the object will be ejected from
   the retracted cast part. In this paper, we give necessary and sufficient
   conditions to test the feasibility of the cast part retraction and
   object ejection, where retraction and ejection directions need not be
   the same. For polyhedral objects, we show that the test can be performed
   in O(n(3) log n) time and the cast parts can be constructed within the
   same time bound. We also give a polynomial time algorithm For finding a
   feasible pair of retraction and ejection directions For a given
   polyhedral object.},

Abstract = {Hip joint surgeries are commonplace in our aging society. Robotic hip
   joint surgery is performed to cut bone precisely and is expected to be
   performed as minimally invasive treatment. Minimally invasive hip joint
   surgery needs operating space between muscle tissues and the bone around
   hip joint. In this paper a prototype of an articulated muscle-retracting
   robot for minimally invasive RAO (Rotational Acetabular Osteotomy and
   one of the hip joint surgeries) is described. The muscle-retracting
   robot's role is to create an operating space between muscles and the
   surface of the bone for the other robot, whose role is to cut bone. The
   mechanical structure is very thin to follow a narrow path and tough
   enough to scrape and retract muscles around a hip joint. The prototype
   is designed based on the required specification from the previous
   experiments data. The prototype has 9 DOF, in which 3 DOF arms are
   capable of controlling the tip position and the force between muscle
   tissues and the surface of the bone. Evaluation of the prototype was
   done by using a compliant control as scraping method of muscle tissues
   from surface of the bone. The capability is revealed as a scraping
   length on a phantom of 140 mm around human hip joint model and on the
   living tissues of 27 mm in the crest of the Mum by magnitude of maximum
   force of 25 N. The scraped living tissues were a narrow part around the
   hip joint. We shall continue to research it and establish a stable
   control method to scrape tissues.},

Abstract = {The present paper studies both the fixed point property (FPP for
   brevity) and the almost fixed point property (AFPP for short) for
   Marcus-Wyse (M-, for short) topological spaces by using an M-retract.
   Under M-topology, let SNM(x) be the smallest open neighborhood of x. In
   this paper we prove that every M-connected subspace of SNM(x) has the
   FPP. Let SCM4 be a simple closed M-curve with four elements in Z(2).
   Besides, consider an M-topological plane (X,-gamma x) (see Definition 5)
   such that SNM(x) C (X,-gamma x), where x is a double even point or an
   even point. Then, proving that SCM4 is an M-retract of (X,-gamma x), we
   propose that every M-topological plane does not have the AFPP. Finally,
   the present paper proves the following: consider M-connected spaces
   (X-i,-gamma x), where X-i subset of Z, 2 <= 5 vertical bar X-i vertical
   bar <= infinity, i is an element of\{1,2\}. Then the Cartesian product
   as an M-topological subspace (X-1 x X-2, X-1 x X-2) does not have the
   AFPP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an iterative improvement algorithm for solving
   instances of the Resource Constraint Project Scheduling Problem with
   Time-Windows (RCPSP/max). The algorithm is based on Iterative Flattening
   Search (IFS), an effective meta-heuristic strategy proposed over the
   past years for solving multi-capacity optimization scheduling problems.
   Given an initial solution, IFS iteratively applies two steps: (1) a
   subset of solving decisions are randomly retracted from a current
   solution (relaxation-step) (2) a new solution is incrementally
   recomputed (flattening-step). At the end, the best solution found is
   returned. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper which
   proposes a version of IFS for solving RCPSP/max instances. The main
   contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) we Succeed in improving 15
   out of 90 solutions with respect to the officially published Current
   best, thus demonstrating the general efficacy of IFS; (2) we highlight
   an intrisic limitation of the original it's strategy in solving
   RCPSP/max, such that under certain circumstances the two-step
   improvement loop can get stuck in a status where no solving decision can
   be retracted; (3) we propose two different escaping strategies which
   extend the original IFS procedure. An experimental evaluation ends the
   paper, comparing the performances of the proposed escaping strategies
   against the original IFS procedure.},

Title = {A phonetic case study of Tsilhqot'in /z/ and /z(?)/},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 2},
Abstract = {This paper provides an acoustic description of /z/ and /z(?)/ in
   Tsilhqot'in (Northern Dene). These sounds are noted by Cook (1993, 2013)
   to show lenition and some degree of laterality in coda position. Based
   on recordings made in 2014 with a single, mother-tongue speaker of
   Tsilhqot'in, we describe their acoustic properties and examine their
   distribution as a function of prosodic position and segmental
   environment. We find that they vary along three dimensions: manner
   (fricative-approximant), degree of retraction (non-retracted-retracted),
   and laterality (non-lateral-lateral). In addition, some tokens have a
   characteristic `buzziness', which has been associated with the Chinese
   front apical vowel (Shao \& Ridouane 2018, 2019) and the Swedish
   `Viby-i' (Westberger 2019). We argue that `lenition' (Kirchner 2004,
   Ennever, Meakins \& Round 2017) can only account for some of the
   observed variation and suggest that both /z/ and /z(?)/ are specified
   for two tongue articulations: tongue tip/blade and tongue body (Laver
   1994), encompassing laterality (and concomitant retraction) in addition
   to the primary coronal gesture.},

   is a GA-inf and a wA-inf; (3) every C-inf S(D, B) induced by a domain
   with a basis B is a wA-inf; (4) the category WAINF of wA-infs and
   approximable mappings is equivalent to the category DOM of domains and
   Scott continuous functions; (5) every wA-inf S satisfying Condition (MT)
   is a retract of wS (the information structure induced by 5) in category

Abstract = {This paper describes the modeling, design, experimental testing and
   optimization of a flapping foil for use as an aquatic propulsive device
   on a robot capable of aerial and aquatic modes of locomotion. Motivation
   for the research stems from numerous avian species which use the same
   flapping mechanism as a means of propulsion in both mediums. The main
   aim of this research is to establish the optimal kinematic parameters
   during aquatic operations that maximise non-dimensionalised performance
   measures, such as propulsive efficiency. Optimization of said parameters
   enables the direct comparison between outstretched and retracted wing
   morphologies and permits scaling for future robotic vehicles. Static
   foils representing the wing in both an extended and retracted
   orientation have been manufactured and tested over a range of
   kinematics. The gathered results enable validation of previously
   developed numerical models as well as quantifying achievable performance
   measures. This research focuses on the mechanical propulsive

Title = {Drag Deorbit Device: A New Standard Reentry Actuator for CubeSats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The increasing number of CubeSats being launched has raised concerns
   about orbital debris because most of these satellites have no means of
   active orbit control. Some technologies exist to increase the surface
   area of a CubeSat and expedite deorbit due to aerodynamic drag in low
   Earth orbit, but most of these devices cannot be retracted, and hence
   cannot be used for orbital maneuvering or collision avoidance. This
   paper presents the drag deorbit device module that is capable of
   deorbiting a 12U, 15 kg CubeSat from a 700 km circular orbit in under 25
   years and can be deployed and retracted to modulate the aerodynamic drag
   force experienced by the satellite. This facilitates the use of
   aerodynamic drag for orbital maneuvering, collision avoidance, and the
   active targeting of a deorbit location. In addition, the geometry of
   this drag device provides three-axis attitude stabilization of the host
   CubeSat using aerodynamic and gravity gradient torques, which is useful
   for many missions and provides a predictable aerodynamic profile for use
   in orbital maneuvering algorithms.},

Title = {Casting with skewed ejection direction},
Journal = {ALGORITHMICA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {44},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Casting is a manufacturing process in which liquid is poured into a cast
   (mold) that has a cavity with the shape of the object to be
   manufactured. The liquid then hardens, after which the cast is removed.
   We address geometric problems concerning the removal of the cast. A cast
   consists of two parts, one of which retracts in a given direction
   carrying the object with it. Afterwards, the object will be ejected from
   the retracted cast part. In this paper we give necessary and sufficient
   conditions to test the feasibility of the cast part retraction and
   object ejection, where retraction and ejection directions need not be
   the same. For polyhedral objects, we show that the test can be performed
   in O(n(2)log(2)n) time and the cast parts can be constructed within the
   same time bound. The complexity of the cast parts constructed is
   worst-case optimal. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding
   a feasible pair of retraction and ejection directions for a given
   polyhedral object.},

Abstract = {The final goal of this project is to design an advanced robotic sampling
   mechanism that can be deployed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to
   obtain small objects. The focus of this part of the research is only on
   designing the lightweight, foldable robotic arm for this system. The arm
   will be designed to utilize Sarrus linkages to efficiently retract and
   extend. This arm has one degree of freedom and the motion in this arm
   can be controlled by torsional springs and one actuator. In the final
   design, the arm, initially, will be in the retracted position, which
   will allow it to be stored in a streamlined case to minimize
   interference with the objects in the path of the drone as it flies. Once
   the drone has reached the desired location, the arm will extend to its
   full length to reach the target object. In this paper, a foldable arm
   has been completely analyzed, designed in SolidWorks, and a prototype of
   it was built and successfully tested. In the next stage of this project,
   a novel gripper would be designed for this mechanism.},

   A characterization of classical Hurewicz fibrations as algebras over a

Abstract = {Effect of Diffuser and Volute on Turbocharger Centrifugal Compressor
   Stability and Performance: Experimental Study - Engine downsizing is
   potentially one of the most effective strategies being explored to
   improve fuel economy. A main problem of downsizing using a turbocharger
   is the small range of stable functioning of the turbocharger centrifugal
   compressor at high boost pressures. Several techniques were studied to
   increase the compressor operating range without sacrificing the
   compressor efficiency. This paper presents the effect of delaying
   diffuser stability on the compressor performance and surge line. Two
   different techniques were investigated, these are grooved and pinched
   diffuser. Moreover, the effect on retracting volute tongue on compressor
   performance is also studied. Pinched diffuser shifted surge line to low
   flow rates, while dropping pressure through compressor. On the other
   hand, some interesting results were obtained when using grooved
   diffuser, these are pressure increase at high flow rates, and choke line
   shift to high flow rates. While retracting volute tongue was interesting
   in improving compressor efficiency, and pressure lines at high speed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel cell transistor using retracted
   Si3N4-liner STI for the enhanced and reliable operation of 256-Mb
   dynamic random access memory (DRAM) in 0.15-mum technology. As the
   technology of DRAM has been developed into the sub-quarter-micron
   regime, the control of junction leakage current at the storage node is
   much more important due to the increased channel doping concentration.
   With the decreased parasitic electric field at the STI corner using the
   retracted Si3N4-liner, the inverse narrow width effect (INWE) was
   significantly reduced. The channel doping concentration, hence, was
   lowered without degrading the subthreshold leakage characteristics and
   the channel doping profile was optimized from the viewpoint of the
   electric field at local areas in the depletion region. In addition to
   the optimized channel doping profile resulted in a dramatic increase in
   data retention time and device yield for 256-Mb DRAM. The proposed cell
   transistor can be extended to future high-density DRAMs in 0.13-mum
   technology and beyond.},

Title = {Micro-fabrication method of graphite mesa microdevices based on optical
   lithography technology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Graphite mesa microdevices have incommensurate contact nanometer
   interfaces, superlubricity, high-speed self-retraction, and other
   characteristics, which have potential applications in high-performance
   oscillators and micro-scale switches, memory devices, and gyroscopes.
   However, the current method of fabricating graphite mesa microdevices is
   mainly based on high-cost, low efficiency electron beam lithography
   technology. In this paper, the processing technologies of graphite mesa
   microdevices with various shapes and sizes were investigated by a
   low-cost micro-fabrication method, which was mainly based on optical
   lithography technology. The characterization results showed that the
   optical lithography technology could realize a large-area of patterning
   on the graphite surface, and the graphite mesa microdevices, which have
   a regular shape, neat arrangement, and high verticality could be
   fabricated in large batches through optical lithography technology. The
   experiments and analyses showed that the graphite mesa microdevices
   fabricated through optical lithography technology basically have the
   same self-retracting characteristics as those fabricated through
   electron beam lithography technology, and the maximum size of the
   graphite mesa microdevices with self-retracting phenomenon can reach 10
   mu m x 10 mu m. Therefore, the proposed method of this paper can realize
   the high-efficiency and low-cost processing of graphite mesa
   microdevices, which is significant for batch fabrication and application
   of graphite mesa microdevices.},

Abstract = {Ocean current refers to the relatively stable flow of the surface water
   of the ocean in a certain direction in a certain direction, and is the
   main regulator of the thermal environment on the surface of the earth.
   At present, the ocean current velocity detection at sea is basically a
   field measurement by a staff member in a boat, and the adjustment of the
   detector position during the measurement process is very inconvenient.
   This paper designs a new submarine current velocity measuring device,
   including measuring ship, cable, fixed anchor and ocean current velocity
   detector. The cable on the reel is retracted through the cable
   retracting room, and the end of the cable is fixedly provided with a
   fixed anchor. The fixed anchor is fixedly provided with a plurality of
   ocean current flow rate detectors, and the ocean current flow rate
   detector has a built-in control chip, a wireless communication module,
   and Pressure Sensor. This device can flexibly adjust the depth of the
   detector according to actual needs, so as to measure the flow velocity
   of different depths.},

Abstract = {The science community generally believes that the violation of research
   integrity is rare. Built upon this belief, the scientific system makes
   little effort to examine the trustworthiness of research. Research
   misconduct refers to an intentional violation of research integrity
   principles, which has an extensive and far-reaching impact on the
   trustworthiness and reputation of science. Emerging evidence has
   suggested that research misconduct is far more common than we normally
   perceive. Far more problematic papers should be retracted than are being
   retracted because of poor actions when confronting research misconduct.
   Research misconduct is usually driven by incentives in the form of
   pursuing publications for researchers' career needs and is further
   facilitated by poor research governance. The current strategy that
   tackles potential research misconduct focuses on protecting the
   reputation of authors and their institutions but neglects the interests
   of patients, clinicians and honest researchers. Removing improper
   incentives, training researchers and imposing better governance are
   vital to reducing research misconduct. Awareness of the possibility of
   misconduct and formalized procedures that scrutinize study
   trustworthiness are important during peer review and in systematic
   reviews.},

Abstract = {Gallbladder torsion is a rare entity. Recently, laparoscopic
   cholecystectomy has become accepted as a standard operation for
   gallbladder torsion. Unfortunately, kyphoscoliosis is a risk factor of
   gallbladder torsion, and kyphoscoliosis results in a low-lying costal
   arch and disturbs the laparoscopic view. The present paper reports a new
   surgical procedure, a ``rib-lifting method{''} for retracting the
   low-lying costal arch at laparoscopic cholecystectomy of gallbladder
   torsion with kyphoscoliosis.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper explores the nature and impact of research misconduct in
   psychology by analyzing 160 articles that were retracted from prominent
   scholarly journals between 1998 and 2017. We compare findings with
   recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and
   management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in
   cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason
   for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make,
   and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals,
   than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors
   should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article
   retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a
   greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a
   debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more
   critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical
   significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are
   Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering
   research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity
   of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the
   context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science
   research. We also challenge individual researchers to reassert the
   primacy of disinterested academic inquiry above pressures that can lead
   to an erosion of scholarly integrity.},

Abstract = {In this article, we show the results of a quantitative and qualitative
   analysis of open citations on a popular and highly cited retracted
   paper: ``Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and
   pervasive developmental disorder in children{''} by Wakefield et al.,
   published in 1998. The main purpose of our study is to understand the
   behavior of the publications citing one retracted article and the
   characteristics of the citations the retracted article accumulated over
   time. Our analysis is based on a methodology which illustrates how we
   gathered the data, extracted the topics of the citing articles and
   visualized the results. The data and services used are all open and free
   to foster the reproducibility of the analysis. The outcomes concerned
   the analysis of the entities citing Wakefield et al.'s article and their
   related in-text citations. We observed a constant increasing number of
   citations in the last 20 years, accompanied with a constant increment in
   the percentage of those acknowledging its retraction. Citing articles
   have started either discussing or dealing with the retraction of
   Wakefield et al.'s article even before its full retraction happened in
   2010. Articles in the social sciences domain citing the Wakefield et
   al.'s one were among those that have mostly discussed its retraction. In
   addition, when observing the in-text citations, we noticed that a large
   number of the citations received by Wakefield et al.'s article has
   focused on general discussions without recalling strictly medical
   details, especially after the full retraction. Medical studies did not
   hesitate in acknowledging the retraction of the Wakefield et al.'s
   article and often provided strong negative statements on it.},

Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},

Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Introduction
   Retraction of published papers has a far-reaching impact on the
   scientific world, especially if the retracted papers were published in
   high-impact journals. Although it has been noted that the retraction
   rates of journals correlated with their citation metrics, no conclusive
   data were available for most clinical specialties. In this study, we
   determined the retraction rate for anesthesia and two comparison groups
   (neurosurgery and high impact clinical journals). We then studied the
   correlation of the retraction rate with citation metrics.
   Methods
   We generated a list of all anesthesia journals that were indexed in the
   National Library of Medicine database. We obtained the number of papers
   published in each journal as well as the number of papers retracted from
   each. We also collated the Impact Factors and H-index of each journal.
   The same methodology was followed for neurosurgery and high impact
   clinical journals. We then studied the correlations between the
   retraction rate and citation metrics of each journal.
   Results
   The retraction index was 2.59 for anesthesiology, 0.66 for neurosurgery
   and 0.75 for the high-impact clinical journals group. The retraction
   rate did not correlate with the citation metrics. However, the number of
   papers published in each journal and the absolute number of retractions
   showed a positive correlation with the citation metrics. The H-index
   showed stronger correlations with these parameters than the Impact
   factor.
   Conclusions
   The number of retractions increased in proportion to both the number of
   papers published in a journal and the citation metrics of that journal.},

Abstract = {Background: Retractions of erroneous and fraudulent papers from the
   biomedical literature continue to be a major concern. The aim of this
   analysis is to summarize trends of retractions in the cardiovascular
   literature over the past four decades. Methods: A review of the
   Retraction Watch database for retracted articles published between 1978
   and 2020 in the cardiovascular literature was performed. Retractions
   with the term ``medicine{''} in the subject code were selected. Titles
   and abstracts were reviewed and only retractions of articles in
   cardiovascular medicine and surgery were included. Results: 459
   retraction notices published in 228 journals were identified. The number
   of retractions increased with time from 1 in 1991 to 48 at the end of
   2019 (P < 0.001). Overall, the yearly percentage of retraction increased
   during the study period (P < 0.001) but decreased after 2015. China had
   the highest percentage of retractions when compared to other countries
   (P < 0.001). The majority of articles were retracted for scientific
   misconduct (n = 289, 63.0\%); retractions due to scientific misconduct
   increased significantly over the study period (P = 0.04) but decreased
   after 2015. The median time from publication to retraction was 1.4 years
   (interquartile range {[}IQR]: 0.6-3.8) and decreased significantly over
   time (P < 0.001). The median number of citations of retracted articles
   was 8.0. Conclusions: The number of retractions and the yearly
   percentage of retraction in the cardiovascular literature increased
   significantly during the study period, although a decrease was seen
   after 2015. Scientific misconduct represents the most common reason for
   retraction, although a reduction has been observed in the last five
   years.},

Abstract = {Retractions solicited by authors following the discovery of an
   unintentional error-what we henceforth call a ``self-retraction{''}-are
   a new phenomenon of growing importance, about which very little is
   known. Here we present results of a small qualitative study aimed at
   gaining preliminary insights about circumstances, motivations and
   beliefs that accompanied the experience of a self-retraction. We
   identified retraction notes that unambiguously reported an honest error
   and that had been published between the years 2010 and 2015. We limited
   our sample to retractions with at least one co-author based in the
   Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany or a Scandinavian country,
   and we invited these authors to a semi-structured interview. Fourteen
   authors accepted our invitation. Contrary to our initial assumptions,
   most of our interviewees had not originally intended to retract their
   paper. They had contacted the journal to request a correction and the
   decision to retract had been made by journal editors. All interviewees
   reported that having to retract their own publication made them
   concerned for their scientific reputation and career, often causing
   considerable stress and anxiety. Interviewees also encountered
   difficulties in communicating with the journal and recalled other
   procedural issues that had unnecessarily slowed down the process of
   self-retraction. Intriguingly, however, all interviewees reported how,
   contrary to their own expectations, the self-retraction had brought no
   damage to their reputation and in some cases had actually improved it.
   We also examined the ethical motivations that interviewees ascribed,
   retrospectively, to their actions and found that such motivations
   included a combination of moral and prudential (i.e. pragmatic)
   considerations. These preliminary results suggest that scientists would
   welcome innovations to facilitate the process of self-retraction.},

Abstract = {Arthroscopic repair of retracted adhesed rotator cuff tear is
   complicated by the fact that standard capsulotendinous releases seldom

   May 2020; Doi: 10.1089/cbr.2019.3275) is being officially retracted from
   the literature.
   The Editor-in-Chief of Cancer Biotherapy and Radiopharmaceuticals (CBR)
   received an email from the corresponding author of the article, Wenying
   Zhou, on September 7, 2020, indicating:
   `` horizontal ellipsis this manuscript should no longer be published
   {[}because of] information from our superior and also after discussion
   with my research team, we want to repeat our experiment and then revise
   the {[}manuscript]. Our team has a lot of controversy about these
   results. In order to ensure the quality of the data and not to mislead
   readers, we decided to {[}retract] the manuscript. We will be more
   rigorous in our further study.{''}
   The editor requested further information about precisely which data
   could not be reproduced, to which Dr. Wenying Zhou responded:
   `` horizontal ellipsis we found that the results of Figure 4B and 4C,
   Figure 5A and 5B could not be repeated. Our repeated results of Figure
   4B and 4C were as follow{[}s]: compared with miR-NC group, there was no
   significant decrease of the luciferase activity in miR-937 group when
   cells co-transfected with EZH2 3 `-UTR-WT.
   Our repeated results of Figure 5A and 5B were as follow{[}s]: miR-937
   inhibited the proliferation of MNK-28 and SGC-7901 cells, but the cell
   proliferation had no significant change in miR-937+EZH2 group compared
   with miR-937+pcDNA group.
   These findings resulted in the uncertainty of the targeted relationship
   between miR-937 and EZH2. We also repeated these experiments in
   different environments, but they all contradict the results in the
   original data. So, the conclusion is very controversial. In a
   responsible attitude to the readers, we decide to {[}retract] the
   manuscript.{''}
   The authors have extended their apologies to the Editor and to the
   readers of CBR.
   Though in the author's original email, the request was made to
   ``withdraw{''} the paper, CBR has decided to fully retract it due to
   irreproducible data, as the journal is committed to preserving the
   scientific literature and the community it serves.},

Abstract = {This paper generalizes many-sorted algebra (MSA) to order-sorted algebra
   (OSA) by allowing a partial ordering relation on the set of sorts. This
   supports abstract data types with multiple inheritance (in roughly the
   sense of object-oriented programming), several forms of polymorphism and
   overloading, partial operations (as total on equationally defined
   subsorts), exception handling, and an operational semantics based on
   term rewriting. We give the basic algebraic constructions for OSA,
   including quotient, image, product and term algebra, and we prove their
   basic properties, including quotient, homomorphism, and initiality
   theorems. The paper's major mathematical results include a notion of OSA
   deduction, a completeness theorem for it, and an OSA Birkhoff variety
   theorem. We also develop conditional OSA, including initiality,
   completeness, and McKinsey-Malcev quasivariety theorems, and we reduce
   OSA to (conditional) MSA, which allows lifting many known MSA results to
   OSA. Retracts, which intuitively are left inverses to subsort
   inclusions, provide relatively inexpensive run-time error handling. We
   show that it is safe to add retracts to any OSA signature, in the sense
   that it gives rise to a conservative extension. A final section compares
   and contrasts many different approaches to OSA. This paper also includes
   several examples demonstrating the flexibility and applicability of OSA,
   including some standard benchmarks like STACK and LIST, as well as a
   much more substantial example, the number hierarchy from the naturals up
   to the quaternions.},

Abstract = {Background Magnetic retraction has potential advantages over existing
   direct physical retraction means (e.g., forceps) in terms of providing
   complete atraumatic retraction, avoiding tumour cell exfoliation as well
   as offering the possibility of noncontact retraction.
   This paper describes a pilot study of surface magnetic retraction of the
   gastric mucosa to facilitate resection.
   Methods Fifteen porcine stomach specimens were used in this pilot study.
   The uniaxial tensile properties of retracted mucosa were initially
   studied using a tensiometer. Magnetic media of ferromagnetic
   microparticles (stainless steel 410) dispersed in cyanoacrylate liquid
   were prepared at four different concentrations, and a neodymium
   permanent magnet was used to magnetically retract the media. The media
   was finally surface-glued to the target mucosa for performing a
   simulated surgical procedure.
   Results The force measurement data show that the retraction forces
   increased as the concentrations of microparticles and magnetic media
   volumes increased. A magnetic media concentration of 2 g/mL was most
   suitable since it offered sufficient retraction force from a small
   volume of applied media, e.g., the observed magnetic forces exerted on
   50 mu L of media were 1.42 N by a 3-mm magnet and 3.75 N by a 6-mm
   magnet, respectively, both being more than sufficient for the mucosal
   retraction. The additional forces required for dissection with four
   alternative instruments, i.e., electrosurgery hook, snares, scalpel or
   scissors, were also measured, e.g., the total force required to retract
   up to 10 mm and resect the mucosa with snares was 0.36 +/- 0.17 N. In a
   simulated surgical procedure (resection of gastric mucosa with glued
   magnetic medium) retraction by the magnet allowed resection of the
   tented mucosa by an electrosurgical snare.
   Conclusion Surface ferromagnetisation of target mucosal tissues could
   enable magnetic retraction for endoscopic surgery.},

Title = {How long does it take for the scientific literature to purge itself of
   fraudulent material?: the Breuning case revisited},
Journal = {CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {843-847},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {It has been proposed that the scientific literature purges itself of
   articles known to be fraudulent. To test this, an investigation was
   carried out of post-retraction citations over a 19-year period in the
   Breuning case.
   On 10 March 2008 a cited reference search was conducted (all languages,
   all document types) using the name `Breuning SE{*}'. The time limit was
   1989-2007 with an option to exclude self-citations. The search included
   the ISI Web of Science Database including the Science Citation Index
   Expanded, the Social Sciences Citations Index and the Arts \& Humanities
   Citation Index. To ascertain the citation context, citations of Breuning
   were classified by two raters as affirmative, negative or neutral.
   For the period 1989-2000 both negative and affirmative citations were
   found. For the period 2001-2006 only affirmative citations (even to
   retracted articles) were found, some in journals with higher impact
   factors than those citing the case as fraudulent. In spite of the small
   number of citations of Breuning's articles, it is alarming that the
   affirmative citing of fraudulent research has not completely ceased but
   continues 24 years post-retraction (retracted 1982, cited 2006). While
   the limitations of a single case study are conceded, the results
   challenge the belief of scientific literature purging itself of
   fraudulent material.
   Retraction databases and widespread availability of computer software to
   check lists of references free of charge in any database or the internet
   are called for. Moreover, if a paper is never formally retracted,
   software for searching author names in the internet for fully
   investigated and proven scientific misconduct might be developed. The
   ethical guidelines on duplicate publication for purposes of
   disseminating the information as widely as possible should be reviewed.},

   Revision},
Journal = {COMPUTACION Y SISTEMAS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {419-434},
Abstract = {Belief merging aims at combining information from multiple sources while
   belief revision studies strategies for retracting information in order
   to maintain consistency when the addition of new evidence to a belief
   base makes it inconsistent. An ordering of the sentences in the belief
   base is used to determine priorities among sentences so that those with
   lower priority can be identified and retracted. This ordering can be
   difficult to generate and maintain. To address this difficulty, in this
   paper we show how to generate automatically an ordering of the belief
   base sentences through the implementation of a belief merging operator.
   We extend the Delta(ps) (PS-Merge) belief merging operator in order to
   consider constraints, then we use this extension, called Delta(ps mu)
   (Delta(ps) under constraints), as a strategy for belief revision. We
   treat new evidence as a constraint and apply the extended merging
   operator to obtain the revised belief base. We propose several
   properties of this operator when compared to other two belief revision
   operators solving four examples described as real-life scenarios.
   Finally we show a software prototype based on this approach, called
   Belief Reviser, freely accessible online.},

Journal = {CELL CALCIUM},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {46},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The first report that high speed Ca2+ waves travel in a restricted zone
   around the cell periphery in a clockwise manner and which can only be
   revealed by very high speed imaging has been quietly retracted. In the
   original report, a single small region of high Ca2+ was seen to spin
   around the cell periphery and around phagosomes formed within phagocytes
   in a manner unlike anything reported previously. This consequently
   caused a lot of interest. Several other papers reporting a similar
   phenomenon in a variety of cells were also published by the same lab and
   the phenomenon has been included in high profile reviews such as in
   Science. However, several groups have failed to reproduce this work and
   attempts to detect the Ca2+ waves or the mechanism for their generation
   have failed. Now, the original report has been quietly retracted. In
   this short commentary, we give a brief account of the sorry story of the
   nonexistent circulating Ca2+ waves (z-waves) in the hope that the
   literature can be rectified and that future cell calcium biologists are
   not misled by these fantastic and spurious Ca2+ reports. (C) 2009

Title = {A Novel Divisive Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm for Geospatial
   Analysis},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the fields of geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing
   (RS), the clustering algorithm has been widely used for image
   segmentation, pattern recognition, and cartographic generalization.
   Although clustering analysis plays a key role in geospatial modelling,
   traditional clustering methods are limited due to computational
   complexity, noise resistant ability and robustness. Furthermore,
   traditional methods are more focused on the adjacent spatial context,
   which makes it hard for the clustering methods to be applied to
   multi-density discrete objects. In this paper, a new method,
   cell-dividing hierarchical clustering (CDHC), is proposed based on
   convex hull retraction. The main steps are as follows. First, a convex
   hull structure is constructed to describe the global spatial context of
   geospatial objects. Then, the retracting structure of each borderline is
   established in sequence by setting the initial parameter. The objects
   are split into two clusters (i.e., ``sub-clusters{''}) if the retracting
   structure intersects with the borderlines. Finally, clusters are
   repeatedly split and the initial parameter is updated until the
   terminate condition is satisfied. The experimental results show that
   CDHC separates the multi-density objects from noise sufficiently and
   also reduces complexity compared to the traditional agglomerative
   hierarchical clustering algorithm.},

Journal = {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {346},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper generalizes the concept of SA-homotopy in finite topological
   adjacency category, which is introduced in our previous work, to graph
   category and discusses its properties. We prove that every SA-strong
   deformation retract of a simple graph G could be obtained by removing
   trivial vertices one by one, which makes it possible to allow an
   iterative algorithm of finding all SA-strong deformation retracts of G.
   We also obtain that two simple graphs are SA-homotopy equivalent if and
   only if they have graph isomorphic cores. Compared with the graph
   homotopy transformation defined by S.T. Yau et al. and the s-homotopy
   transformation defined by R. Boulet et al., the main advantage of
   SAhomotopy transformation is that it could reflect correspondences
   between vertices, and hence it more accurately describe the
   transformation process than the graph homotopy transformation and
   s-homotopy transformation. As an application of SA-homotopy on graphs,
   we introduce the mapping class group of a graph, which also shows its
   advantage over the graph homotopy transformation and the s-homotopy
   transformation.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Laser heating of cantilevered tips: Implications for photoinduced force
   microscopy},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW B},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Number = {19},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) measures changes in the force
   between an atomically sharp tip and the sample under the influence of
   applied radiation. Several mechanisms contribute to the overall force,
   including forces introduced due to thermal heating of the sample and the
   tip. In this paper, we study the effect of laser heating of the
   retracted tip under illumination conditions relevant to PiFM and how it
   affects the mechanical resonance properties of the cantilever. Using a
   gold-coated silicon cantilever with its tip irradiated by a tightly
   focused 532-nm laser beam, we find that the tip temperature increases
   linearly at 7.5 K/mW of average laser power, irrespective of whether the
   laser is pulsed or continuous wave. The temperature rise gives rise to a
   decrease of the cantilever's spring constant and an increase of the
   damping coefficient. We demonstrate that for retracted tips, these
   thermally induced changes to the mechanical resonance only moderately
   impact the measured photoinduced force, as the measured scattering force
   is at least an order of magnitude stronger than the effective force
   introduced by laser heating under experimentally relevant conditions.},

Title = {Evaluation of optimized compensators on a 3D planning system},
Journal = {MEDICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {25},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1837-1844},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A commercially available treatment planning system contains several
   functions that allow for the automation of missing tissue and optimized
   compensators, where the former retracts the bolus toward the source, and
   the latter attempts, by iteration, to establish a uniform dose at some
   user defined depth. The intent of this paper is to report on the
   compensators designed by the system and to compare them to those devised
   through conventional techniques. It is demonstrated that the system can
   model the dosimetric effects of compensators with a high degree of
   accuracy; measured and predicted doses agree to within 3\%. Optimized
   compensators show slightly improved dose uniformity over thickness
   reduced compensators. Both show significantly improved uniformity over
   compensators that simply retract the bolus geometry. In cases where
   internal inhomogeneities exist, however, the dose uniformity from the
   optimized compensators vary by as much as 6\% at the target depth. These
   deviations are comparable to the errors of the inhomogeneity algorithm
   itself. The pathlength reduction technique has been applied to both
   missing tissue and inhomogeneity compensation, and it has been found
   that for inhomogeneity compensation, the pathlength reduced compensators
   produce more uniform distributions than those generated by the
   optimization algorithm. (C) 1998 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {This paper seeks to introduce a strategy of science communication: Total
   SciComm or all-out science communication. We proposed that to maximize
   the outreach and impact, scientists should use different media to
   communicate different aspects of science, from core ideas to methods.
   The paper uses an example of a debate surrounding a now-retracted
   article in the Nature journal, in which open data, preprints, social
   media, and blogs are being used for a meaningful scientific
   conversation. The case embodied the central idea of Total SciComm: the
   scientific community employs every medium to communicate scientific
   ideas and engages all scientists in the process.},

Title = {Against the use and publication of contemporary unethical research: the

Volume = {46},

Pages = {678-684},

Abstract = {Recent calls for retraction of a large body of Chinese transplant
   research and of Dr Jiankui He's gene editing research has led to renewed
   interest in the question of publication, retraction and use of unethical
   biomedical research. In Part 1 of this paper, we briefly review the now
   well-established consequentialist and deontological arguments for and
   against the use of unethical research. We argue that, while there are
   potentially compelling justifications for use under some circumstances,
   these justifications fail when unethical practices are ongoing-as in the
   case of research involving transplantations in which organs have been
   procured unethically from executed prisoners. Use of such research
   displays a lack of respect and concern for the victims and undermines
   efforts to deter unethical practices. Such use also creates moral taint
   and renders those who use the research complicit in continuing harm. In
   Part 2, we distinguish three dimensions of `non-use' of unethical
   research: non-use of published unethical research, non-publication, and
   retraction and argue that all three types of non-use should be upheld in
   the case of Chinese transplant research. Publishers have
   responsibilities to not publish contemporary unethical biomedical
   research, and where this has occurred, to retract publications. Failure
   to retract the papers implicitly condones the research, while uptake of
   the research through citations rewards researchers and ongoing
   circulation of the data in the literature facilitates subsequent use by
   researchers, policymakers and clinicians.},

Journal = {ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {49},

Abstract = {In this paper, the novel design of a force-controlled end-effector for
   automated polishing processes is presented. The proposed end-effector is
   to be integrated into a macro-mini robot polishing cell. The macro robot
   (in this study, it is a six-axis industrial robot) is used to position
   the mini robot (the proposed end-effector) according to the workpiece
   profile while the mini robot controls the polishing force. Th
   end-effector has a polishing head that can be extended and retracted by
   a linear hollow voice coil actuator to provide tool compliance. The main
   advantage of the proposed design is that it allows this motion Without
   extending or retracting the polishing motor nor spindle, which reduces
   the inertial effects that may results in undesired vibrations. By
   integrating a force sensor, the polishing force is measured and fed back
   to the controller to regulate it according to the polishing pre-planned
   requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed device to track a
   certain desired force with step changes under different feed rates has
   been examined through polishing experiments. The results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the presented device to reduce the vibration and
   achieve remarkable force tracking. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Enumeration of objects and substances in non-human primates: experiments

   May 2009 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been
   retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editors in
   Chief, Michelle De Haan and Charles Nelson and John Wiley \& Sons
   Limited. The authors determined that the looking time coding performed
   by the first author, N. Mahajan, was inaccurate and did not reflect the
   looking times found by other trained coders. A reanalysis of the data
   reported in this paper failed to verify the reported effects, and thus
   the authors have requested that the publication be retracted. Ms.
   Mahajan takes sole responsibility for the inaccurate coding. An
   investigation found that the inaccurate coding was not caused by
   intentional, knowing, reckless, or grossly negligent action by Ms.
   Mahajan. All authors of the original publication joined in the request

Abstract = {In this paper we present some properties of tangent and normal cones of
   epi-Lipschitz subsets of complete Riemannian manifolds. The fact that
   epi-Lipschitz subsets of complete Riemannian manifolds are absolute
   neighborhood retracts is proved. A notion of Euler characteristic of
   epi-Lipschitz subsets of complete Riemannian manifolds is introduced.
   Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition which ensures that the Euler
   characteristic of this class of sets is equal to one. Then, these
   results are applied to equilibrium theory on complete parallelizable

Abstract = {In this paper we use the equivariant theory of retracts to give some

Title = {VARIATIONS ON BACKTRACKING FOR TMS},
Journal = {LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {515},
Pages = {17-33},
Abstract = {We review the back-tracking technique of Doyle's Truth Maintenance
   System (TMS). Backtracking in principle is to recover from a failure
   state by retracting some assumptions. We discuss three possible
   applications for the TMS: (1) Transforming a contradiction proof into a
   direct proof if a false-node is labelled with IN. (2) Selecting another
   extension if an odd loop failure arises. (3) Doing theory revision if no
   extension exists. In this paper, we elaborate the first and the second
   alternative. If the TMS is used in an autoepistemic or default prover
   (as in {[}15]) it needs sufficient justifications for first-order
   proofs. We show how backtracking allows to complete this set
   incrementally by applying a special case of the deduction theorem. For
   finding extensions, we describe Doyle's label methods as meta rules
   deriving statements of the form IN(p) and inverted left perpendicular
   IN(q). If a node q of an odd loop is labelled with IN and OUT We obtain
   a contradiction in this meta reasoning system. Hence, we can again apply
   backtracking to identify and retract the label assumptions being
   responsible for the failure. Thus, we obtain an efficient TMS that
   detects an extension whenever one exists.},

Volume = {128},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is threefold: (i) to identify the combinations of
   national culture dimensions that lead to high (or low) male or female
   retracted publications, (ii) to understand the role of personal trust as
   a relevant condition that combines with national culture dimensions to
   cause high (or low) male or female retraction, and (iii) to identify the
   differences in the configurations that lead to those outcomes. Based on
   framework of Hofstede's cross-cultural analysis and data from Hofstede
   Center, World Value, and Web of Science, this essay analyzes cultural
   complex causal relations between national culture and trust dimensions
   (conditions), and male and female retracted publications (outcomes) in
   30 countries nationally and globally by fuzzy-set qualitative
   comparative analysis. This research provides three major insights: (i)
   Cultural dimensions (power distance, individualism, masculinity,
   uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation) and trust are not
   necessary conditions for both male and female to cause retractions, (ii)
   different levels of personal trust (high/low) combine with national
   cultural dimensions in order to produce different configurations that
   can lead to high or low retractions, and (iii) Each gender causes
   retractions in a similar or identical way, but each also owns its unique
   way. Finally, we provide effective policy recommendations to specific
   countries based on our critical conclusions and discussions.},

Title = {Impact of misinformation on ivermectin internet searches and prescribing
   trends during COVID-19},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 18},
Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a surge of
   publications seeking to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A byproduct of
   the rush to understand COVID-19 has been the publication and subsequent
   retraction of papers promoting unfounded treatments, such as
   ivermectin-an anti-parasitic medication. This study aims to determine
   the impact retracted studies may have had on ivermectin prescription
   rates. TriNetX was used to gather anonymized patient data from 67
   healthcare organizations both within the USA (36,711 patients; 91.6\%)
   and abroad (3,266 patients; 8.14\%) to obtain prescribing rates for
   ivermectin between April 2020-September 2022. Google Trends was used to
   gauge online interest in purchasing ivermectin in relation to
   prescribing rates. We found that ivermectin use largely increased
   following periods in which later-retracted journal articles were written
   touting its potential benefits. Multiple spikes in Google searches were
   observed, with the first three local peaks occurring within the first,
   second, and third publication `clusters,' respectively. The maximum peak
   for searches occurred just one month after the maximum number of
   ivermectin prescriptions. This information is important for
   understanding how health-related misinformation spreads, and how to best
   minimize and counteract the impact of such misinformation in the future.},

Title = {Absolute retractness of automata on directed complete posets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The notion of retractness, which is about having left inverses
   (reflection) for monomorphisms, is crucial in most branches of
   mathematics. One very important notion related to it is injectivity,
   which is about extending morphisms to larger domains and plays a
   fundamental role in many areas of mathematics as well as in computer
   science, under the name of complete or partial objects. Absolute
   retractness is tightly related to injectivity and is in fact equivalent
   to it in many categories. In this paper, combining the two important
   notions of actions of semigroups and directed complete posets, which are
   both crucial abstraction and useful in mathematics as well as in
   computer science, we consider the category Dcpo-S of actions of a
   directed complete semigroup on directed complete posets, and study
   absolute retractness with respect to both monomorphisms and embeddings
   in this category. Among other things, we show that absolute retract
   (S-)dcpo's are complete but the converse is not necessarily true.
   Investigating the converse, we find that if we add the property of being
   a countable chain to completeness, over some kinds of dcpo-monoids such
   as dcpo-groups and commutative monoids, we get absolute retractness.
   Furthermore, we show that there are absolute retract S-dcpo's, which are
   not chains.},

Abstract = {A test element in a group G is an element g with the property that if
   f(g) = g for an endomorphism f of G to G then f must be an automorphism.
   A test element in a free group is called a test word. Nielsen gave the
   first example of a test word by showing that in the free group on x, y
   the commutator {[}x, y] satisfies this property. T. Turner recently
   characterized test words as those elements of a free group contained in
   no proper retract. Since free factors are retracts, test words are
   therefore very strong forms of non-primitive elements. In this paper we
   give some new examples of test words and examine the relationship
   between test elements and several other concepts, in particular generic
   elements and almost-primitive elements (APE's). In particular we show
   that an almost primitive element which lies in a certain type of verbal
   subgroup must be a test word. Further using a theorem of Rosenberger on
   equations in free products we prove a result on APE's, generic elements
   and test words in certain free products of free groups. Finally we
   examine test elements in non-free groups and introduce the concept of
   the test rank of a group.},

Title = {Misconduct Policies, Academic Culture and Career Stage, Not Gender or
   Pressures to Publish, Affect Scientific Integrity},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {The honesty and integrity of scientists is widely believed to be
   threatened by pressures to publish, unsupportive research environments,
   and other structural, sociological and psychological factors. Belief in
   the importance of these factors has inspired major policy initiatives,
   but evidence to support them is either non-existent or derived from
   self-reports and other sources that have known limitations. We used a
   retrospective study design to verify whether risk factors for scientific
   misconduct could predict the occurrence of retractions, which are
   usually the consequence of research misconduct, or corrections, which
   are honest rectifications of minor mistakes. Bibliographic and personal
   information were collected on all co-authors of papers that have been
   retracted or corrected in 2010-2011 (N=611 and N=2226 papers,
   respectively) and authors of control papers matched by journal and issue
   (N=1181 and N=4285 papers, respectively), and were analysed with
   conditional logistic regression. Results, which avoided several
   limitations of past studies and are robust to different sampling
   strategies, support the notion that scientific misconduct is more likely
   in countries that lack research integrity policies, in countries where
   individual publication performance is rewarded with cash, in cultures
   and situations were mutual criticism is hampered, and in the earliest
   phases of a researcher's career. The hypothesis that males might be
   prone to scientific misconduct was not supported, and the widespread
   belief that pressures to publish are a major driver of misconduct was
   largely contradicted: high-impact and productive researchers, and those
   working in countries in which pressures to publish are believed to be
   higher, are less-likely to produce retracted papers, and more likely to
   correct them. Efforts to reduce and prevent misconduct, therefore, might
   be most effective if focused on promoting research integrity policies,
   improving mentoring and training, and encouraging transparent
   communication amongst researchers.},

   was discovered that formal Internal Review Board approvals were not
   properly secured prior to the study taking place or to the submission of
   the article for peer review in Ecopsychology, despite a statement in the
   paper indicating such approvals were in place. Upon discovering this
   violation, the authors sought- and received-post-publication approvals
   from their institutional Internal Review Board at Sapienza University of
   Rome (Italy). It is important to note, however, that informed consent
   was indeed obtained from each participant in the study. Though the
   Journal, its Editor, and its Publisher applaud the authors for
   selfreporting this situation, it remains a clear violation of proper and
   standard protocols for studies containing human subjects. Therefore, the
   Journal officially retracts the paper. Ecopsychology, its Editors, and
   its Publisher are committed to upholding the strictest standards of the
   scientific record and the community it serves and will not tolerate any
   improprieties or violations of proper scientific publishing conventions.},

Title = {The effectiveness of peer review in identifying issues leading to
   retractions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Retractions are necessary to remove flawed research from citable
   literature but cannot offset the negative impact those publications have
   on science advances and public trust. The editorial peerreview process
   is intended to prevent flawed research from being published. However,
   there is limited empirical evidence of its effectiveness in identifying
   issues that lead to retractions. This study analyzed the peer-review
   comments (provided by Clarivate Analytics) for a sample of retracted
   publications (provided by Retraction Watch) to investigate how the
   peer-review process effectively detects the areas where the retraction
   causes lie and whether reviewer characteristics are related to the
   effectiveness. We found that a small proportion of peer reviews
   suggested rejections during the peer review stage, while about half
   suggested acceptance or minor revision for those later retracted papers.
   The peer-review process was more effective in identifying retraction
   causes related to data, methods, and results than those related to text
   plagiarism and references. Additionally, factors such as reviewer
   seniority and the level of match between reviewers' expertise and the
   submission were significant in determining the possibility of peer
   reviews identifying suspicious areas in submissions. We discussed
   potential insights from these findings and called for collective efforts
   to prevent retractions.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a new experimental setup for the purpose of testing

   fifty linear actuators mounted under a latex foil. By retracting and
   extending the cylinders, different shapes can be imprinted on the latex
   foil. The control of the actuators consists of synchronizing
   controllers, cooperative feedforward controllers, and PI controllers. An
   experiment is presented in which the surface forms a travelling wave,
   which means that the desired shape is time-varying. The shown
   experiments demonstrate the capability of the new laboratory setup.},

Abstract = {A theorem of E.C. Turner states that if F is a finitely generated free
   group, then the test words are precisely the elements not contained in
   any proper retract. In this paper, we examine some ideas in model theory
   and logic related to Turner's characterization of test words and
   introduce Turner groups, a class of groups containing all finite groups
   and all stably hyperbolic groups satisfying this characterization. We
   show that Turner's theorem is not first-order expressible. However, we
   prove that every finitely generated elementary free group is a Turner
   group.},

   turbines response to the wind speed by changing swept area automatically
   extend outward at low wind speed and retract at excessive wind speed.
   This action increases the efficiency and get higher power capture at low
   wind speed. These innovative design found that the power production

   spectra and algebras over operads in modules over a commutative ring

   structured ring spectra of Dror's generalized Whitehead theorem for
   topological spaces; here TQ-homology is short for topological Quillen
   homology. We also prove retract theorems for the TQ-completion and
   homotopy completion of nilpotent structured ring spectra.},

Title = {Elucidating bacterial adhesion to mucosal surface by an original AFM
   approach},
Journal = {BMC MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Background Fish skin represents an ancient vertebrate mucosal surface,
   sharing characteristics with other mucosal surfaces including those of
   the intestine. The skin mucosa is continuously exposed to microbes in
   the surrounding water and is therefore important in the first line
   defense against environmental pathogens by preventing bacteria from
   accessing the underlying surfaces. Understanding the microbe-host
   interactions at the fish skin mucosa is highly relevant in order to
   understand and control infection, commensalism, colonization,
   persistence, infection, and disease. Here we investigate the
   interactions between the pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida (A.
   salmonicida) and Yersinia ruckeri (Y. ruckeri), respectively, and the
   skin mucosal surface of Atlantic salmon fry using AFM force
   spectroscopy. Results The results obtained revealed that when retracting
   probes functionalized with bacteria from surfaces coated with
   immobilized mucins, isolated from salmon mucosal surfaces, rupture
   events reflecting the disruption of adhesive interactions were observed,
   with rupture strengths centered around 200 pN. However, when retracting
   probes functionalized with bacteria from the intact mucosal surface of
   salmon fish fry no adhesive interactions could be detected. Furthermore,
   rheological measurements revealed a near fluid-like behavior for the
   fish fry skin mucus. Taken together, the experimental data indicate that
   the adhesion between the mucin molecules within the mucous layer may be
   significantly weaker than the interaction between the bacteria and the
   mucin molecules. The bacteria, immobilized on the AFM probe, do bind to
   individual mucins in the mucosal layer, but are released from the near
   fluid mucus with little resistance upon retraction of the AFM probe, to
   which they are immobilized. Conclusion The data provided in the current
   paper reveal that A. salmonicida and Y. ruckeri do bind to the
   immobilized mucins. However, when retracting the bacteria from intact
   mucosal surfaces, no adhesive interactions are detected. These
   observations suggest a mechanism underlying the protective function of
   the mucosal surface based on the clearing of potential threats by
   adhering them to loosely attached mucus that is subsequently released
   from the fish skin.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to obtain the micro drill bit

   Meanwhile, the key factors that affect the micro drill bit temperature

   Design/methodology/approach - The purpose of this paper is to obtain the

   and the temperature drop in retracting process with simulation software.
   Meanwhile, the key factors that affect the micro drill bit temperature
   will be obtained as well. The results can also be used to improve the
   accuracy in on-line drilling temperature measurement.
   Findings - Micro drill bit high-temperature area mainly concentrates in
   the cutting edge and chisel edge. With the increase of spindle speed and
   feed speed, the micro drill bit highest temperature increased. The micro
   drill bit temperature drop rate reaches 20 degrees in the micro-drilling
   retraction process with certain parameters. The micro drill bit highest
   temperature detected by an infrared camera is lower by 22 degrees than
   that in real drilling. The simulation results can be used to guide the
   actual industrial production.
   Originality/value - The simulation results can be applied to revise the
   temperature measurement by an infrared camera in the drilling process.
   Drilling experiments show that the simulation method is correct and has
   certain practical significance. The current temperature measurement
   method can satisfy most of the requirements of temperature measurements.},

Title = {Misconduct, Marginality and Editorial Practices in Management, Business
   and Economics Journals},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Objectives
   The paper presents data on the two problems of misconduct and
   marginality in management, business and economics (MBE) journals and
   their practices to combat these problems.
   Design
   Data was collected in three phases. First, all publicly retracted papers
   in MBE journals were identified through keywords searches in 7 major
   databases (n = 1329 journals). Second, a focused survey was distributed
   to editors involved in such retractions (n = 64; response rate = 28\%).
   Finally, a survey was administered to all active journals in the seven
   databases to collect data on editors' perceptions and practices related
   to the two problems (n = 937, response rate = 31.8\%). Frequency
   analyses, cross tabulations, and qualitative analyses of open answers
   were used to examine the data.
   Results
   184 retracted papers in MBE journals were identified in 2005-2015 (no
   retraction was found before 2005). From 2005-2007 to 2012-2015, the
   number of retractions increased by a factor ten with an all-time high in
   2015. The survey to journals with reported retractions illustrates how
   already a few cases of suspected misconduct put a strain on the
   editorial workload. The survey to all active journals revealed that 42\%
   of the respondents had started to use software to screen all submitted
   papers, and that a majority recognized the problem of marginality, as
   indicated by salami-style submissions. According to some editors,
   reviewers easily spot such submissions whereas others argued that
   authors may submit thinly sliced papers in parallel to several journals,
   which means that this practice is only discovered post-publication. The
   survey question on ways to support creative contributions stimulated a
   rich response of ideas regarding editorial vision, engaged boards and
   developmental approaches. The study uses data from three specialized
   fields, but its findings may be highly relevant to many journals in the
   social sciences.},

   regular injectivity implies equivariant completeness, but the converse
   is true only if S is left simple. Finally, it is proved that regularly
   injective S-posets are exactly the complete and cofree-retract ones.
   Among other results, we also see that the Skornjakov and Baer criteria
   fail for regular injectivity of S-posets.},

   concrete formulas for the Chern character of p-summable
   quasihomomorphisms and invertible extensions, analogous to those of
   Nistor. The latter formulation is completely algebraic and based on the

Title = {Homotopical properties of hyperspaces of generalized continua: the
   proper and ordinary cases},
Journal = {DISSERTATIONES MATHEMATICAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {568},
Pages = {4-66},
Abstract = {Given a generalized continuum X, let CLF(X) and C(X) denote its
   hyperspaces of (non-empty) closed subsets and subcontinua, respectively,
   with the Fell topology (= Vietoris topology on C(X)).
   This paper deals with the connectedness at infinity and the proper
   homotopy of these hyperspaces. It is proved that both CLF(X) and C(X)
   are one-ended generalized continua. Moreover, CLF(X) is always strongly
   one-ended, while for C(X) this property is equivalent to the
   continuumwise connectedness of X.
   Concerning homotopy types, we show that CLF(X) is always contractible.
   By contrast, its proper homotopy type is trivial if and only if X is cik
   at infinity. Furthermore, CLF(X) is properly homotopically trivial if
   and only if it has trivial weak proper homotopy type.
   With regard to C(X), the triviality of the proper homotopy type is shown
   to be equivalent to contractibility, and this is attained whenever the
   generalized continuum X has the Kelley property. In addition, C(X) has
   trivial weak homotopy type (proper or ordinary) if and only if X is
   continuumwise connected.
   Proper and ordinary hyperspace (deformation) retracts are also
   considered. For generalized Peano continua such retracts are
   characterized. In absence of local connectedness some results and
   examples are given and several questions are posed.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Pages = {573-597},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The ET{*} algorithm is a complete evaluation strategy for Datalog
   programs, which are logic programs without function symbols. The ET{*}
   algorithm uses extension tables and depth-first iterative deepening to
   provide the evaluation of pure function-free logic programs as
   declarative specifications. Extension tables are a memo facility that
   the algorithm uses both to cut infinite derivation paths for complete
   evaluation and to optimise the evaluation of logic programs.
   The original implementation of the ET{*} algorithm incorporated
   extension tables as part of the Prolog database using the built-in
   predicates assert and retract. The advantage of implementing the
   extension table using the Prolog database is the portability of the
   ET{*} algorithm. There are several disadvantages, however, with this
   approach. One disadvantage is the cost associated with the built-in
   predicates assert and retract, which are known to be expensive
   operations in most current Prolog systems. Another disadvantage is the
   differences across implementations in the semantics that these built-ins
   provide for dynamic predicates. This paper presents an efficient
   implementation of extension tables as a global data structure in Prolog,
   which includes a set of built-in primitives for manipulating the
   extension table. The ET{*} algorithm is updated to reflect the
   utilisation of the global extension table data structure. The
   implementations of the ET{*} algorithm are compared using time and space
   performance on a variety of benchmark programs.},

Title = {Internet publicity of data problems in the bioscience literature
   correlates with enhanced corrective action},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Several online forums exist to facilitate open and/or anonymous
   discussion of the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Data integrity is
   a common discussion topic, and it is widely assumed that publicity
   surrounding such matters will accelerate correction of the scientific
   record. This study aimed to test this assumption by examining a
   collection of 497 papers for which data integrity had been questioned
   either in public or in private. As such, the papers were divided into
   two sub-sets: a public set of 274 papers discussed online, and the
   remainder a private set of 223 papers not publicized. The sources of
   alleged data problems, as well as criteria for defining problem data,
   and communication of problems to journals and appropriate institutions,
   were similar between the sets. The number of laboratory groups
   represented in each set was also similar (75 in public, 62 in private),
   as was the number of problem papers per laboratory group (3.65 in
   public, 3.54 in private). Over a study period of 18 months, public
   papers were retracted 6.5-fold more, and corrected 7.7-fold more, than
   those in the private set. Parsing the results by laboratory group, 28
   laboratory groups in the public set had papers which received corrective
   action, versus 6 laboratory groups in the private set. For those
   laboratory groups in the public set with corrected/retracted papers, the
   fraction of their papers acted on was 62\% of those initially flagged,
   whereas in the private set this fraction was 27\%. Such clustering of
   actions suggests a pattern in which correction/retraction of one paper
   from a group correlates with more corrections/retractions from the same
   group, with this pattern being stronger in the public set. It is
   therefore concluded that online discussion enhances levels of corrective
   action in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, anecdotal discussion
   reveals substantial room for improvement in handling of such matters.},

Abstract = {root The retroperitoneal surgical approach has gained acceptance as a
   way to access the ventral aspect of the lumbar spine. Visualization is
   often limited, however, by the psoas muscle, which lies along the
   posterolateral aspect of the spine. Improved visualization is often
   attempted by retracting the muscle from the wound, which generally pulls
   the muscle laterally from the spine but not posteriorly, which is
   desirable for a better exposure of the spine, particularly the neural
   elements. In this paper, the authors describe a simple, atraurnatic
   technique for retraction of the psoas muscle that allows excellent
   visualization of the spine.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the benefits of vacuum assistance to 18 gauge needle
   biopsy. Current biopsy methods are inefficient or have a high rate of
   failure, causing the need for further painful insertions. A novel needle
   insertion device was developed to create the vacuum in the needle. Using
   multiple pneumatic cylinders, a vacuum is created inside the end-cut
   needle by retracting the trocar while inserting the needle. Calculations
   were done to determine the force caused by the vacuum. Experiments
   inserting the needle into porcine kidney have shown that the vacuum
   assistance increases cutting efficiency.},

Title = {Design and aerodynamic performance analysis of a variable-sweep-wing
   morphing waverider},
Journal = {AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The wide speed range and large flight envelope of the hypersonic vehicle
   require that its aerodynamic configuration still has good aerodynamic
   performance at low Mach number. Therefore, the variable Mach number
   waverider is proposed to achieve good flight performance in a wide speed
   range. In this paper, based on the delta-winged variable Mach number
   waverider, a variable-sweep-wing morphing waverider is proposed and
   studied, including four specific sweep-wing configurations, namely
   loiter, standard, dash and wing-retracted configurations. In the current
   study, the aerodynamic performances of this variable-sweep-wing morphing
   waverider with four configurations are investigated under
   subsonic/supersonic/hypersonic flight conditions. At the same time, the
   numerical approaches employed are validated against the available
   experimental data in the open literature. The obtained results show that
   compared with the wing-retracted configuration, the best flight
   performance of this variables-weep-wing morphing waverider can be
   achieved using different configuration for different flight condition.
   However, within the hypersonic speed range, the aerodynamic performance
   is improved through morphing but its advantages are not as large as that
   in the subsonic speed. Besides, effects of wing downwash and shockwave
   are also analyzed. In conclusion, the variable-sweep-wing morphing
   waverider improves both low-speed and high-speed aerodynamic
   performances, and it expands the flight speed range. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF PLASMA DYNAMICS IN THE VICINITY OF A RETRACTING
   FLUX TUBE},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {831},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In a previous paper, we presented an analytical, zero-beta model for
   supra-arcade downflows in which a retracting flux tube deforms the
   surrounding magnetic field, constricting the flow of plasma along
   affected field lines and, in some cases, forcing the plasma to exhibit
   collimated shocks. Here we present a numerical simulation based on the
   same model construction-a retracting flux tube is treated as a rigid
   boundary around which the plasma is forced to flow and the magnetic
   field and plasma evolve according to the governing equations of
   magnetohydrodynamics. We find that the collimated shocks described in
   our previous study are recovered for plasma beta in the range of 0 less
   than or similar to beta less than or similar to 1, while for 1 less than
   or similar to beta the behavior is similar to the simpler hydrodynamic
   case, with classical bow shocks forming when the acoustic Mach number
   approaches or exceeds unity. Furthermore, we find that while the plasma
   beta is important for identifying the various types of behaviors, more
   important still is the Alfven Mach number, which, if large, implies that
   the bulk kinetic energy of the fluid exceeds the internal energy of the
   magnetic field, thereby leading to the formation of unconfined,
   fast-mode magnetosonic shocks, even in the limit of small beta.},

Title = {Impact of Marine Locomotion Constraints on a Bio-inspired Aerial-Aquatic
   Wing: Experimental Performance Verification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MECHANISMS AND ROBOTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME},

Abstract = {This paper describes the design, fabrication, experimental testing and
   performance optimization of the morphology of a flapping wing for use on
   a robot capable of aerial and aquatic modes of locomotion. The focus of
   the optimization studies is that of wing design for aquatic propulsion.
   Inspiration for the research stems from numerous avian species which use
   a flapping wing for the dual purpose of locomotion (propulsion) in both
   air and water. The main aim of this research is to determine optimal
   kinematic parameters for marine locomotion that maximize
   nondimensionalized performance measures (e. g., propulsive efficiency),
   derived from analysis of avian wing morphing mechanisms that balance
   competing demands of both aerial and aquatic movement. Optimization of
   the kinematic parameters enables the direct comparison between
   outstretched (aerial) and retracted (aquatic) wing morphologies and
   permits trade-off studies in the design space for future robotic
   vehicles. Static foils representing the wing in both an extended and
   retracted orientation have been manufactured and subsequently subjected
   to testing over a range of kinematics. Details of the purpose built 2
   degree-of-freedom (dof) flapping mechanism are presented. The gathered
   results enable validation of previously developed numerical models as
   well as quantifying achievable performance measures. This research
   focuses on the mechanical propulsive efficiencies and thrust
   coefficients as key performance measures whilst simultaneously
   considering the required mechanical input torques and the associated
   thrust produced.},

Abstract = {Ocean current refers to the relatively stable flow of the surface water
   of the ocean in a certain direction, and is the main regulator of the
   thermal environment on the surface of the earth. At present, the ocean
   current velocity detection at sea is basically a field measurement by a
   staff member in a boat, and the adjustment of the detector position
   during the measurement process is very inconvenient. This paper designs
   a new submarine current velocity measuring device that includes the
   measuring ship, cable, fixed anchor and ocean current velocity detector.
   The cable on the reel is retracted through the cable retracting room,
   and the end of the cable is fixedly provided with a fixed anchor. The
   fixed anchor is fixedly provided with a plurality of ocean current flow
   rate detectors, which have a built-in control chip, a wireless
   communication module, and Pressure Sensor. The ocean current detector
   adopts the acoustic time difference current meter, which runs stably and
   is the most widely used current meter at present. This device can
   flexibly adjust the depth of the detector according to actual needs, so
   as to measure the flow velocity of different depths. (c) 2020 The

Abstract = {The Hanna Neumann conjecture is a statement about the rank of the

   conjecture was posed by Hanna Neumann in 1957. In 2011, a strengthened

   by Igor Mineyev. In this paper we show that the strengthened Hanna
   Neumann conjecture holds not only in free groups but also in
   non-solvable surface groups. In addition, we show that a retract in a
   free group and in a surface group is inert. This implies the
   Dicks-Ventura inertia conjecture for free and surface groups.},

Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the contact characteristics between a copper
   workpiece and a diamond tool in a force sensor-integrated fast tool
   servo (FS-FTS) for single point diamond microcutting and in-process
   measurement of ultra-precision surface forms of the workpiece. Molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to identify the subnanometric
   elastic-plastic transition contact depth, at which the plastic
   deformation in the workpiece is initiated. This critical depth can be
   used to optimize the FS-FTS as well as the cutting/measurement process.
   It is clarified that the vibrations of the copper atoms in the MD model
   have a great influence on the subnanometric MD simulation results. A
   multi-relaxation time method is then proposed to reduce the influence of
   the atom vibrations based on the fact that the dominant vibration
   component has a certain period determined by the size of the MD model.
   It is also identified that for a subnanometric contact depth, the
   position of the tool tip for the contact force to be zero during the
   retracting operation of the tool does not correspond to the final depth
   of the permanent contact impression on the workpiece surface. The
   accuracy for identification of the transition contact depth is then
   improved by observing the residual defects on the workpiece surface
   after the tool retracting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Low spatter CO2 arc welding is often used for ultra-thin steel sheets
   with a thickness of under 1.0-mm. In this paper, a high speed forward
   and reverse motion control algorithm for the motor in a welding torch
   and a dedicated controller for it are presented. The dedicated
   controller is designed with a motor driver IC (A3930) and a DSP
   (TMS320F-28069) coded with the proposed motion control algorithm. It is
   easy to optimize the operating parameters in the proposed algorithm
   according to various thin steel sheets. Since the torch motor must be
   able to feed or retract welding wire at a high speed while cooperating
   with the brushed DC motor in the wire feeder, the performance required
   in selecting the torch motor is examined and presented in this paper.
   With the proposed control algorithm, an optimal torch motor and the
   developed controller, the feeding and retracting motions of the welding
   wire at high speeds are possible. This results in low heat inputs to the
   base material and low spatter short-circuiting transfer. To verify the
   superiority of CO2 arc welding with the proposed torch motor control
   algorithm and the developed controller, an arc welding robot prototype
   system was fabricated and 100\% purity CO2 gas arc welding with thin
   steel plates with a thickness of 0.8-mm was performed. This was
   accomplished with an interlocking a 50 W class brushless DC motor as the
   torch motor, the developed low spatter motion controller and an arc
   welding power supply.},

   increasingly complex delails of gene regulation has provided any grounds
   to retract or qualify Crick's version of the central dogma. In
   particular it defends the role of the genes as the sole bearers of
   information, and argues that the mechanism of epigenetic modification of
   the DNA is but another vindication of Crick's version of the central
   dogma. The paper shows that arguments of C.K. Waters for the distinctive
   causual role of the genes are equivalent in important respects to the
   present ones and concludes with a defense of the informational role of
   the genes against an argument from trans-acting genetic regulation due
   to Stotz.},

Abstract = {The incidence of fraud, or scientific misconduct, has been much

   important part in the literature of biomedical research for a number of
   years. Darsee was discovered to have fabricated the data which formed
   the bases for many articles and abstracts he published through 1981. The
   present study shows that, although a considerable amount of time has
   passed and some of his papers have been retracted, Darsee's work
   continues to be cited, and cited positively, in the literature on
   cardiology through 1990. The implications of this phenomenon are

   of affine actions of reductive algebraic groups over C Amnon Neeman

   this paper is to study several applications of this flow. In particular
   we prove that the cone on a Zariski closed subset of Pn-1(R) is a
   deformation retract of Rn. We also give an exposition of an extension to
   real reductive algebraic group actions of Schwarz's excellent
   explanation of Neeman's sketch of a proof of his deformation theorem.
   This exposition precisely explains the use of Lojasiewicz gradient
   inequality. The result described above for cones makes use of these

   such dangerous tasks is designed. Through the wheel/track transform
   mechanism, the wheel and track motion modes can be switched
   alternatively to adapt to different ground situations. The friction
   between the belt wheel and hub is used to drive the track and its guide
   wheel is the one of the transform mechanism. When the guide wheel is
   retracted back into the hub, the track can automatically rebound back to
   wheel and wrap on the hub. Field experiments demonstrate that the
   designed platform can move on different ground surfaces.},

   manuscripts (three from Turkey and one from Pakistan) had to be
   retracted from Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences from January 2014 to
   July 2015 due to scientific misconduct. There is a need to search for
   effective measures which could help reduce the number of retractions and
   prevent scientific literature from being further polluted, which seems
   to be increasing every year.},

Abstract = {Large spacecraft missions have both technical and financial needs.
   Technical needs drive the inclusion of numerous subsystems, which must
   be configured or deployed. Financial needs, for many spacecraft, are
   filled through generating public support, which is enhanced by being
   able to show the spacecraft in operation. This paper presents DeSCJOB, a
   small satellite that is deployed from a larger spacecraft. It launches
   from the parent spacecraft, captures images of whatever is desired
   (moving around the larger spacecraft, if desired) and then retracts back
   to its docking point automatically. Its utility for operational and
   public relations imaging is discussed.},

Abstract = {Motivated by a dynamic location problem for graphs, Chung, Graham and
   Saks introduced a graph parameter called winder. Graphs of winder 2
   turned out to be, in graph-theoretic language, retracts of hypercubes.
   These graphs are also known as median graphs and can be characterized as
   partial binary Hamming graphs satisfying a convexity condition. In this
   paper an O(n(3/2) log n) algorithm is presented to recognize these
   graphs. As a by-product we are also able to isometrically embed median
   graphs in hypercubes in O(m log n) time. (C) 1999-Elsevier Science B.V.

   railway operator). The system automatically detects obstacles in the
   pantograph gauge at a distance of up to 70m and retracts the pantograph
   before collision with an obstacle. Due to the multitude of
   similar-looking objects within an epipolar line, the algorithms
   developed give false obstacle warnings in over 0.7\% of the images. With
   recognition of steady arms, the reliability of the system is improved
   considerably. With a constant detection ratio, false obstacle warnings
   can be reduced by 28\%.},

Abstract = {Until recently, published evidence for the responses of species to
   climate change had revealed more examples of species expanding than
   retracting their distributions. However, recent papers on butterflies
   and frogs now show that population-level and species-level extinctions
   are occurring. The relative lack of previous information about range
   retractions and extinctions appears to stem, at least partly, from a
   failure to survey the distributions of species at sufficiently fine
   resolution to detect declines, and from a failure to attribute such
   declines to climate change. The new evidence suggests that
   climate-driven extinctions and range retractions are already widespread.},

   account is offered according to which disavowals involve three
   components: an admission of having performed the target act, a

   compared to the related speech acts of denial, retraction, apology, as

Abstract = {Friction stir welding is one of the newest methods of material joining.
   It is constantly developed and Refill Friction Stir Spot Welding (RFSSW)
   is one of its varieties. RFSSW is a solid-state joining technology.
   During the process, heat is generated as a result of friction between
   the tool and the joined materials as well as the material plastic
   deformation. RFSSW uses a rotating tool consisting of probe, sleeve and
   clamping ring. RFSSW joints are produced in two ways. The difference
   between them is in the way the probe and sleeve plunge into the joined
   materials. In the first method the probe is plunged into the workpieces,
   but the sleeve is retracted. At the same time, the welded material is
   transferred to the sleeve location. Upon reaching the desired plunge
   depth, the tool is kept in that position. After that, the rotating probe
   is retracted from the welded joint and the material is pressed into the
   welded point by the sleeve. In the second method, the sleeve is plunged
   into the workpieces, but the probe is retracted. RFSSW is an attractive
   process for manufacturers who need to reduce the weight of their
   assemblies by joining light-weight metals. To date the process is mainly
   used in the automotive and aerospace industries (the panel structures,
   load-bearing structures etc.).
   In the paper numerical and experimental studies of tensile test of the
   uniform and welded samples are presented. The specimens are made of 7075
   aluminum. The welded samples are made using RFSSW technology. Material
   properties, which have been determined experimentally for the uniform
   specimens, were assumed in the numerical calculations. The numerical
   calculations were performed with the ADINA System based on Finite
   Element Methods. For the uniform samples the experimental and numerical
   calculation results of elongation and changes in thickness were
   compared. For the welded samples, which varied in location of RFSSW
   spots, the tensile forces were determined experimentally, while the
   reduced stress and plastic strain distributions were determined
   numerically. The numerical studies of RFSSW spot welded specimens
   indicated that the initiation of failure occurred in the edge zone of
   the welds.},

Abstract = {Recent research in ontologies and descriptions logics has focused on
   compromising between expressiveness and reasoning ability, with many
   other issues being neglected. One major issue that has been neglected is
   how one should go about in modifying ontologies as inconsistency arises.
   The central concern of this problem is therefore to determine the most
   rational way of modifying ontologies, such that no extra knowledge would
   be retained in or retracted from the knowledge base. The purpose of this
   paper is to outline the complexities in this and to present some
   insights into the problem of ontology modification. Description logic
   (DL) is used in this paper as the underlying logic for the
   representation of ontology, and ontology modification is performed based
   on this logic.},

Title = {An Extension Problem of a Connectedness Preserving Map between Khalimsky
   Spaces},
Journal = {FILOMAT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},

Pages = {15-28},
Abstract = {The goal of the present paper is to study an extension problem of a
   connected preserving (for short, CP-) map between Khalimsky (K-for
   brevity, if there is no ambiguity) spaces. As a generalization of a
   K-continuous map, for K-topological spaces the recent paper {[}13]
   develops a function sending connected sets to connected ones (for
   brevity, an A-map: see Definition 3.1 in the present paper). Since this
   map plays an important role in applied topology including digital
   topology, digital geometry and mathematical morphology, the present
   paper studies an extension problem of a CP-map in terms of both an
   A-retract and an A-isomorphism (see Example 5.2). Since K-topological
   spaces have been often used for studying digital images, this extension
   problem can contribute to a certain areas of computer science and
   mathematical morphology.},

Title = {Governing knowledge in the scientific community: Exploring the role of
   retractions in biomedicine},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Although the validity of knowledge is critical to scientific progress,
   substantial concerns exist regarding the governance of knowledge
   production. While research errors are as relevant to the knowledge
   economy as defects are to the manufacturing economy, mechanisms to
   identify and signal ``defective{''} or false knowledge are poorly
   understood. In this paper, we investigate one such institution - the
   system of scientific retractions. We analyze the universe of
   peer-reviewed scientific articles retracted from the biomedical
   literature between 1972-2006 and comparing with a matched control sample
   in order to identify the correlates, timing, and causal impact of
   scientific retractions. This effort provides insight into the workings
   of a distributed, peer-based system for the governance of validity in
   scientific knowledge. Our findings suggest that attention is a key
   predictor of retraction - retracted articles arise most frequently among
   highly-cited articles. The retraction system is expeditious in
   uncovering knowledge that is ever determined to be false (the mean time
   to retraction is less than two years) and democratic (retraction is not
   systematically affected by author prominence). Lastly, retraction causes
   an immediate, severe, and long-lived decline in future citations.
   Conditional on the obvious limitation that we cannot measure the
   absolute amount of false science in circulation, these results support
   the view that distributed governance systems can be designed to uncover
   false knowledge relatively swiftly and to mitigate the costs that false
   knowledge for future generations of producers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Is the soundness-only quality control policy of open access mega
   journals linked to a higher rate of published errors?},
Journal = {SCIENTOMETRICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},
Number = {2},
Pages = {917-923},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Open access mega journals (OAMJs) are broad and centralized open access
   journals that have come to represent profitable outlets for accumulating
   large volumes of research from multiple fields of study, including
   papers that are rejected from other journals by the same publisher. Some
   OAMJs charge hefty (exceeding US\$1000) article processing fees. One
   characteristic of OAMJs is a large editorial board. In 2015, Bjork
   indicated that a primary characteristic of an OAMJ was its
   prepublication soundness only peer review, i.e., novelty, significance,
   relevance and impact are assessed only post-publication. However, such a
   premise ignores the inherent nature of peers' bias. This controversial
   claim is challenged in this paper by assessing whether there is a link
   between research output (number of papers published in each OAMJ) and
   number of errata, including retractions. We assessed 16 OAMJs indexed in
   Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science and found wide variation in
   published errata and retractions across OAMJs between 2012 and 2018.
   PLOS ONE had the highest correction rate (3.159\%), followed by Medicine
   (3.158\%), BMJ Open (2.949\%) and Scientific Reports (2.896\%). In
   contrast, PeerJ, Elementa, and Science of the Anthropocene did not
   publish any errata in 2012-2018 but IEEE Access had a correction rate of
   0.059\%. Regarding the retraction rate, the highest share of retracted
   publications was seen in Medicine (0.079\%), Cell Reports (0.035\%) and
   PLOS ONE (0.030\%), while nine out of the 16 studied OAMJs did not have
   any retracted publications during 2012-2018. We conclude that there is
   wide variation in quality control, as assessed through errata and
   retractions, among OAMJs. We recommend, therefore, that the soundness
   only peer review prerequisite for OAMJs should be scrapped.},

Journal = {ANAESTHESIA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Number = {5},
Pages = {573-584},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In 2016 the World Health Organization recommended intra-operative
   ventilation with 80\% inspired oxygen to reduce surgical site infection
   rates, based upon a meta-analysis of 15 randomised controlled trials, of
   which two were by Mario Schietroma's research group. Five trials by this
   group have been retracted for duplication, plagiarism, statistical error
   and lack of ethical approval. We analysed 40 papers by this group: 24
   randomised controlled trials (5064 participants) and 16 observational
   studies (1847 patients). There was evidence that data integrity was
   compromised in 38 out of the 40 analysed papers. The distribution of
   baseline characteristics in randomised controlled trials was unlikely, p
   = 1.5 x 10(-8): continuous variables within trials were heterogeneous, p
   = 1.9 x 10(-9), and categorical variables were homogeneous, p = 8.5 x
   10(-20). Effects of interventions varied less than expected between
   studies: for categorical variables, for instance postoperative wound
   infection, p < 1 x 10(-7), and for continuous variables, for instance
   HLA-DR concentration, p = 0.00001. Of 184 calculable p values, for
   baseline variables or results, 179 (98\%) were incorrect, ranging from
   three orders of magnitude too small to 10 orders of magnitude too large.
   Twenty-one graphs occurred 81 times in 23 out of 40 papers. Liberal
   peri-operative oxygen did not reduce surgical site infection in a
   meta-analysis of 20 trials that excluded seven trials by Mario
   Schietroma and colleagues (odds ratio (95\%CI) 0.89 (0.73-1.08); p =
   0.23). An update by the World Health Organization has now excluded
   trials of liberal oxygen by Schietroma's group, four of which have not
   been retracted. We conclude that Mario Schietroma's work should not
   inform practice until investigated.},

Abstract = {Public policies to promote research and development (R\&D), such as

   space E, A : D(A) is a m-accretive map such that - A generates a compact

Abstract = {The centers of the generic central simple algebras with involution are
   interesting objects in the theory of central simple algebras. These
   fields also arise as invariant fields for linear actions of projective
   orthogonal or symplectic groups. In this paper, we prove that when the
   characteristic is not 2, these fields are retract rational, in the case
   the degree is 8m and m is odd. We achieve this by proving the equivalent
   lifting property for the class of central simple algebras of degree 8m
   with involution. A companion paper {[}D.J. Saltman, Invariant fields of
   symplectic and orthogonal groups, preprint] deals with the case of m,
   2m, and 4m where stronger rationality results are proven. (C) 2002

Abstract = {In the growing field of rehabilitation robotics, the modelling of a real
   robot is a complex and passionate challenge. On the crossing point of

   an accurate simulation. In this paper, it is proposed the design of an
   efficient three-dimensional model of the quadruped Bioloid robot setting
   segmented pantographic legs, in order to actively retract the quadruped
   legs during locomotion and minimizing large forces due to shocks, such
   that the robot is able to safely and dynamically interact with the user

Abstract = {This paper summarizes new analytical and empirical results for the
   economic approach to simulation selection problems that we introduced
   two years ago. The approach seeks to help managers to maximize the
   expected net present value (NPV) of system design decisions that are
   informed by simulation. It considers the time value of money, the cost
   of simulation sampling, and the time and cost of developing simulation
   tools. This economic approach to decision making with simulation is
   therefore an alternative to the statistical guarantees or probabilistic
   convergence results of other commonly-used approaches to simulation
   optimization. Empirical results are promising. This paper also retracts
   a claim that was made regarding the existence of Gittins' indices for
   these problems - their existence remains an open question.},

Abstract = {Transfer printing is a volatile tool to retract micro devices from a

   device is assembled to an array for integration in various applications.
   Among the five approaches of transfer printing summarized in the paper,
   the viscoelastic property of stamps is widely adopted to modulate the
   interfacial adhesion between the stamp and devices by applying different
   pulling speeds. A viscoelastic model for transfer printing is
   analytically established. It shows that the interfacial adhesion
   increases with pulling speed, which is verified by the experiments and

Abstract = {While ethics in publishing has been increasingly debated, there seems to
   be a lack of a theoretical framework for making sense of existing rules
   of behavior as well as for designing, managing and enforcing such rules.
   This letter argues that systems-oriented disciplines, such as complexity
   science and human factors, offer insights into new ways of dealing with
   ethics in publishing. Some examples of insights are presented. Also, a
   call is made for empirical studies that unveil the context and details
   of both retracted papers and the process of writing and publishing
   academic papers. This is expected to shed light on the complexity of the
   publication system as well as to support the development of a just
   culture, in which all participants are accountable.},

Abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new version of the concept of order
   varieties. Namely, in addition to closure under retracts and products we
   require that the class of posets should be closed under taking
   idempotent subalgebras. As an application we prove that the variety
   generated by an order-primal algebra on a finite connected poset P is
   congruence modular if and only if every idempotent subalgebra of P is
   connected. We give a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether or not
   a variety generated by an order-primal algebra admits a near unanimity
   function and so we answer a problem of Larose and Zadori.},

Title = {Wetting and Drying of Aqueous Droplets Containing Nonionic Surfactants
   CnEm},
Journal = {LANGMUIR},

Volume = {37},
Number = {14},
Pages = {4091-4101},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic study of the wetting and drying of
   aqueous pico-liter droplets containing nonionic surfactants
   polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (CnEm; n = 10, 12, 14, m = 6 or 8) in
   comparison with the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The
   spreading and drying of droplets on hydrophilic substrates were studied
   by tracking the three-phase contact line (TCL) and by interferometry.
   CnEm droplets undergo phase separation during drying: a water-rich
   droplet retracts and leaves behind a thin film that is postulated to be
   a surfactant mesophase. This thin film either retracts or breaks up into
   small droplets on a longer time scale. The receding contact angle of the
   water-rich droplet on the thin film in the late stage of drying of CnEm
   droplets is independent of hydrophobicity of substrates, supporting the
   inference that a mesophase is present on the surface. Both CnEm and SDS
   solutions inhibit spreading on hydrophilic surfaces, which is attributed
   to Marangoni contraction as a result of a surface tension gradient
   across the gas-liquid interface. More pronounced suppression of
   spreading is observed in the case of CnEm solutions, possibly due to the
   phase transition of surfactant solution in the vicinity of the initial
   TCL leading to a viscous phase at the TCL that pins the droplet. Tracer
   particle measurements reveal that mild Marangoni flows exist for
   droplets with surfactant concentrations well above the critical micelle
   concentration (CMC). Origins of the surfactant gradients that result in
   Marangoni flows are discussed.},

   can increase the risk of honest error as well as misconduct. To date, 33
   papers have been identified as unsuitable for public use and either
   retracted, withdrawn, or noted with concern. Asia is the source of most
   of these manuscripts (n=19; 57.6\%) with China the largest Asian

Abstract = {A rigid space is a topological vector space whose endomorphisms are all
   simply scalar multiples of the identity map. This is in sharp contrast
   to the behavior of operators on l(2), and so rigid spaces are, from the
   viewpoint of functional analysis, fundamentally different from Hilbert
   space. Nevertheless, we show in this paper that a rigid space can be
   constructed which is topologically homeomorphic to Hilbert space. We do
   this by demonstrating that the first complete rigid space can be
   modified slightly to be an AR-space (absolute retract), and thus by a
   theorem of Dobrowolski and Torunczyk is homeomorphic to l(2).},

Year = {1995},
Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1169-1184},

Abstract = {A characteristic of wood chip refiners is that the static gain between
   the input (plate gap) and the output (motor load) is both nonlinear and
   time-varying, with reversal in the sign of the gain indicating the onset
   of pulp pad collapse towards lower values of the plate gap. The control
   objective is to regulate the motor load while avoiding pad collapse. The
   problem is principally stochastic in nature, since the gap at which gain
   reversal occurs can wander unpredictably. The control strategies
   developed in this paper are based primarily on viewing the refiner as a
   plant with uncertain linear characteristics. The proposed strategy
   consists of a multimodel parameter estimator (AFMM), a new active
   suboptimal dual controller, and some simple heuristic logic to deal with
   the nonlinearities. Several different combinations were evaluated by
   conducting a series of trials on an industrial refiner. The results show
   that while a more conventional estimator might have been used, the extra
   effort required to implement the dual controller appears to have been
   worthwhile, since probing aided significantly in the identification of
   gain changes and helped to prevent turn-off. The results also show that
   a variable retract strategy worked better than using a constant retract
   term for preventing operation in the pad collapse region, and that the
   control performance could be improved by identifying the maximum load
   the first time a pad collapse is encountered, and then using this
   information to set an upper limit on the set point.},

Abstract = {In this paper, generalized metrics mean metrics taking values in general
   linearly ordered Abelian groups. Using the Hahn fields, we first prove
   that for every generalized metric space, if the set of the Archimedean
   equivalence classes of the range group of the metric has an infinite
   decreasing sequence, then every nonempty closed subset of the space is a
   uniform retract of the ambient space. Next we construct simultaneous
   extensions of generalized metrics and ultrametrics. From the existence
   of extensors of generalized metrics, we characterize the final
   compactness of generalized metrizable spaces using the completeness of
   generalized metrics.

Abstract = {Results of full and reduced scale onshore and offshore testing of a new
   vertical load capable anchor type, the Suction Embedded Plate Anchor or
   SEPLA is presented in this paper. The SEPLA plate anchor is unique in
   that it uses a modified suction pile, renamed a suction follower, to
   install the plate anchor directly to final penetration depth in lieu of
   less precise drag embedment methods. The follower is immediately
   retracted once the plate anchor is brought to design soil depth and can
   be used to install additional plate anchors indefinitely. Although early
   research including laboratory and quarter-scale field testing will be
   discussed; the focus of this paper will be the results of full-scale
   offshore and 1/5(th)-scale onshore testing conducted between 1999 and
   2001.},

Abstract = {Linear logic programs are challenging to implement efficiently because
   facts are asserted and retracted frequently. Implementation is made more
   difficult with the introduction of useful features such as rule
   priorities, which are used to specify the order of rule inference, and
   comprehensions or aggregates, which are mechanisms that make data
   iteration and gathering more intuitive. In this paper, we describe a
   compilation scheme for transforming linear logic programs enhanced with
   those features into efficient C++ code. Our experimental results show
   that compiled logic programs are less than one order of magnitude slower
   than hand-written C programs and much faster than interpreted languages
   such as Python.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report several large classes of affine varieties (over
   an arbitrary field K of characteristic 0) with the following property:
   each variety in these classes has an isomorphic copy such that the
   corresponding isomorphism cannot be extended to an automorphism of the
   ambient affine space K-n. This implies, in particular. that each of
   these varieties has at least two inequivalent embeddings in K-n. The
   following application of our results seems interesting: we show that
   lines in K-2 are distinguished among irreducible algebraic retracts by
   the property of having a unique embedding in K-2. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {As it was proved in {[}4, Sect. 3], the poset of extensions of the

   generated by the class of the underlying algebras of the defining
   matrices. In the present paper we apply this general result to the
   three-valued paraconsistent logic proposed by Halkowska-Zajac {[}2].
   Studying corresponding prevarieties, we prove that extensions of the
   logic involved form a four-element chain, the only proper consistent
   extensions being the,last non-paraconsistent extension of it and the
   classical logic.},

Title = {The Fixed Point Property of Non-Retractable Topological Spaces},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Unlike the study of the fixed point property (FPP, for brevity) of
   retractable topological spaces, the research of the FPP of
   non-retractable topological spaces remains. The present paper deals with
   the issue. Based on order-theoretic foundations and fixed point theory
   for Khalimsky (K-, for short) topological spaces, the present paper
   studies the product property of the FPP for K-topological spaces.
   Furthermore, the paper investigates the FPP of various types of
   connected K-topological spaces such as non-K-retractable spaces and some
   points deleted K-topological (finite) planes, and so on. To be specific,
   after proving that not every one point deleted subspace of a finite

Title = {An investigation into the impact and implications of published papers
   from retracted research: systematic search of affected literature},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objective Analyses of the impact of a body of clinical trial reports
   subject to research misconduct have been few. Our objective was to
   examine the impact on clinically relevant research of a group of
   researchers' trial reports ('affected trial reports') affected by
   research misconduct, and whether identification of misconduct invoked a
   reappraisal.
   Design In 2016, we used five databases and search engines to identify
   `citing publications', that is, guidelines, systematic and other
   reviews, and clinical trials citing any of 12 affected trial reports,
   published 1998-2011, eventually retracted for research misconduct. The
   affected trial reports were assessed more likely to have had impact
   because they had hip fracture outcomes and were in journals with impact
   factor >4. Two authors assessed whether findings of the citing
   publications would change if the affected trial reports were removed. In
   2018, we searched for evidence that the citing publications had
   undertaken a reassessment as a result of the potential influence of the
   affected trial reports.
   Results By 2016 the affected trial reports were cited in 1158
   publications, including 68 systematic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative
   reviews, guidelines and clinical trials. We judged that 13 guidelines,
   systematic or other reviews would likely change their findings if the
   affected trial reports were removed, and in another eight it was unclear
   if findings would change. By 2018, only one of the 68 citing
   publications, a systematic review, appeared to have undertaken a
   reassessment, which led to a correction.
   Conclusions We found evidence that this group of affected trial reports
   distorted the evidence base. Correction of these distortions is slow,
   uncoordinated and inconsistent. Unless there is a rapid, systematic,
   coordinated approach by bibliographic databases, authors, journals and
   publishers to mitigate the impact of known cases of research misconduct,
   patients, other researchers and their funders may continue to be
   adversely affected.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Analysis of Microglial Ca2+ Activity at Single-Cell
   Resolution},
Journal = {JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Number = {190},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microglia are the sole resident immune cells in the central nervous
   system. Their morphology is highly plastic, changing depending on their
   activity. Under homeostatic conditions, microglia possess a highly
   ramified morphology. This facilitates their monitoring of the
   surrounding environment through the continuous extending and retracting
   of their processes. During brain injury and inflammation, however,
   microglia become activated and undergo dramatic morphological changes,
   retracting their ramified processes and swelling their cell body. This
   facilitates activities such as migration and phagocytosis, which
   microglia undertake to navigate the brain environment to a less
   pathological state. This close relationship between microglial
   morphology and changes in their activity have enabled considerable
   insights into various microglial functions. However, such morphological
   and activity changes are themselves phenomena that can result from any
   number of intracellular signaling pathways. Moreover, the time-lag
   between stimulus and response, as well as the highly compartmentalized
   morphology of microglia, make it difficult to isolate the causative
   mechanisms that underpin function. To solve this problem, we developed a
   genetically modified mouse line in which a highly sensitive fluorescent
   Ca2+ -indicator protein is specifically expressed in microglia. After
   describing methods for in vivo microglial Ca2+ imaging, this paper
   presents a structured analysis approach that classifies this Ca2+
   activity to rationally defined subcellular regions, thus ensuring that
   the spatial and temporal dimensions of the encoded information are
   meaningfully extracted. We believe that this approach will provide a
   detailed understanding of the intracellular signaling rules that govern
   the diverse array of microglial activities associated with both higher
   brain functions and pathological conditions.},

Title = {Adding Nanofat to Fat Grafting to Treat Velar Scarring in Velopharyngeal
   Incompetence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Despite improved surgical techniques in palatoplasty a number of
   patients will present post-operatively with incomplete velopharyngeal
   closure due to several reasons including inherent shortness of the
   palate or midline scar contracture. This incomplete closure of the
   velopharynx during speech, known as velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI)
   causes hypernasality and nasal turbulence during speech. Treatment
   options in severe cases include revisions, pharyngeal flaps, and
   pharyngoplasties while in mild cases fat grafting has demonstrated its
   efficacy in improving velopharyngeal closure. Nevertheless, midline
   scarring can cause velar rigidity and inelasticity giving rise to
   inadequate velar elevation and retro position. Management of retracting
   velar scars is a real challenge. Despite an accurate surgical correction
   retracting scars tend to recur with negative effects on speech.
   Emulsified fat (nanofat) has proven to be a relevant source of stem
   cells and growth factors and has been successfully employed so far for
   the treatment of facial wrinkles and scars. The aim of this paper is to
   propose the application of the nanofat technique for the improvement of
   velar scar elasticity and pliability in addition to fat grafting to the
   posterior pharyngeal wall and the tonsillar pillars to further improve
   results when treating mild VPI. Studies with larger samples should
   follow to substantiate our findings but based on our preliminary
   experience, the authors feel that the nanofat could be a promising
   adjunct to the current repair procedures, due to its regenerative
   properties.},

Abstract = {In a 1981 paper, Duffus and Rival define an order variety as a class of
   posets that is closed under the formation of products and retracts. They
   also introduce the notion of an irreducible poset. In the present paper
   we define nonextendible colored posets and certain minimal nonextendible
   colored posets that we call zigzags. We characterize via nonextendible
   colored posets the order varieties generated by a set of posets. If the
   generating set contains only finite posets our characterization is via
   zigzags. By using these theorems we give a characterization of finite
   irreducible posets.
   As an application we show that two different finite irreducible posets
   generate two different order varieties. We also show that there is a
   poset which has two different representations by irreducible posets. We
   thereby settle two open problems listed in the Duffus and Rival paper.},

Abstract = {Direct, semidirect and Zappa-Sz,p products provide tools to decompose
   algebraic structures, with each being a natural generalisation of its
   predecessor. In this paper we examine Zappa-Sz,p products of monoids and
   semigroups and investigate generalised Greens relations and for these
   Zappa-Sz,p products. We consider a left restriction semigroup S with
   semilattice of projections E and define left and right actions of S on E
   and E on S, respectively, to form the Zappa-Sz,p product . We further
   investigate properties of and show that S is a retract of . We also find
   a subset T of which is left restriction.},

   Different collision avoidance algorithms have been implemented: change
   of tool orientation, selection of other machine axes configurations and
   simple tool retract. The effect of a tool orientation change on the
   quality of the machined surface has been studied in order to define the
   range of tool orientations that may be used for collision avoidance.},

Abstract = {We show that with proper accounting of convention-dependent phases the
   mass spectra evaluated by us in an earlier paper satisfy the trace,
   SU(5) reassembly and Goldstone counting consistency checks. Phase
   accounting shows that the transposition symmetry called Hermiticity will
   be manifest only if signs arising from the product of six phase factors
   are reinserted. This uncovers the errors in the claims of others
   (retracted in subsequent work) concerning the inconsistency of our
   results. The chiral multiplet spectra of the two calculations are
   equivalent. However our method also gives all gauge and gauge chiral
   spectra as well as a decomposition of all SO(10) minimal supersymmetric
   grand unified theory couplings, for both tensors and spinors, which are
   unavailable, even in principle, using the methods of the above papers.},

Abstract = {In the paper hereby, design of a single stage Fowler flap is proposed.
   The flap is meant to increase lifting abilities of a straight wing at
   low speeds. It is applicable to small-sized remotely controlled unmanned
   aerial vehicles widely available to hobbyists.
   The design process included thorough analysis of flow around a wing foil
   in case of both retracted and deployed flap. To obtain aerodynamic
   coefficients values at different angles of attack and Reynolds numbers
   was a primary goal. In addition, a linkage mechanism was developed to
   make it possible for the flap to move along a complex path.
   Various plots and charts are depicted thereafter with sole purpose of
   providing better understanding of the idea.},

Abstract = {A new approach of paper defect recognition is proposed. To implement
   this method, computer is used to acquire paper image and the subtraction
   algorithm is used to determine if the image contains defect at first.
   For the image with paper defect, wavelet packet decomposition is applied
   to extracting the feature vector of the defect. A BP neural network is
   designed for recognizing the defect type according to the feature
   vector. This approach provides a unified detection algorithm for
   different types of paper defects. The experiment data prove this method
   is valid and can be applied in modern paper defect inspection system.

   having an approach that is coherent, internally consistent, capable of
   generating propositions testable in real organizations and generating

Abstract = {As a byproduct of solving the surprise-exam paradox, Saul Kripke
   formulates a ``dogmatism paradox{''} which seems to show that knowledge
   entails dogmatism. In this paper, the author analyzes the nature of the
   dogmatism paradox from a logical dynamical perspective. The author
   suggests that the dogmatism paradox is better understood as a paradox of
   knowledge attribution rather than of knowledge. Therefore, the dogmatism
   paradox could be solved without sacrificing the principle of epistemic
   closure. Based on a famous version of relevant alternatives theory, the
   author formalizes a logic of knowledge attribution in the style of
   logical dynamics, namely, public retraction logic, and analyzes how
   knowledge attributions are retracted with the expansion of relevant
   alternatives.},

   independent Bernoulli random variables. In this short note we show that
   these approximations, presented in the literature as being exact, can be
   very inaccurate when compared with the true ARL values. Moreover, the
   use of these poor ARL approximations has led to many flawed articles,
   which should be either corrected or retracted.},

Abstract = {In this paper we study the notion of injectivity in the category Pos-S
   of S-posets for a pomonoid S. First we see that, although there is no
   non-trivial injective S-poset with respect to monomorphisms, Pos-S has
   enough (regular) injectives with respect to regular monomorphisms (sub
   S-posets). Then, recalling Banaschewski's theorem which states that
   regular injectivity of posets with respect to order-embeddings and
   completeness are equivalent, we study regular injectivity for S-posets
   and get some homological classification of pomonoids and pogroups. Among
   other things, we also see that regular injective S-posets are exactly
   the retracts of cofree S-posets over complete posets.},

Abstract = {Surface adhesion properties are important to various applications of
   graphene-based materials. Atomic force microscopy is powerful to study
   the adhesion properties of samples by measuring the forces on the
   colloidal sphere tip as it approaches and retracts from the surface. In
   this paper we have measured the adhesion force between the colloid probe
   and the surface of graphene (graphene oxide) nanosheet. The results
   revealed that the adhesion force on graphene and graphene oxide surface
   were 66.3 and 170.6 nN, respectively. It was found the adhesion force
   was mainly determined by the water meniscus, which was related to the
   surface contact angle of samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The Effect of Pheromone Synthesis and Gland Retraction on Translocation
   and Dynamics of Pheromone Release in the MothChloridea virescens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {7},
Pages = {581-589},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Most species of moths use a female-produced sex pheromone to bring mates
   together. Typically, sex pheromone is synthesized in a specialized gland
   and released during the behavior of ``calling{''}, in which the
   ovipositor and gland are extruded, allowing pheromone to evaporate.
   Although there has been much study on how a gland makes specific
   pheromone components, we know relatively little about how it actually
   functions with regard to synthesis, storage and release. In this paper,
   we investigated three aspects of gland function in the noctuid
   mothChloridea virescens(Fabricius): (i) whether translocation of
   pheromone from site of synthesis to release is dependent on calling or
   ovipositor movement, (ii) whether pheromone synthesis rate limits
   release and (iii) how intermittent calling (observed in this and other
   species) might affect the dynamics of release rate. Firstly, by
   manipulating the gland to simulate calling (extruded) or non-calling
   (retracted), we showed that pheromone translocation occurred regardless
   of whether the gland was retracted or extruded. Secondly, by
   manipulating pheromone production, we found that females that produced
   more pheromone had higher release rates. It was especially noticeable
   that females had a higher release rate at the start of calling, which
   dropped rapidly and leveled off over time. Together, these data suggest
   that intermittent calling inC. virescens(and other species) may function
   to allow females to replenish pheromone stores on the gland surface
   between calling bouts, so that brief, high release rates occur at the
   start of a calling bout; thus, potentially increasing a female's chances
   of attracting a mate.},

Abstract = {In many contexts a retraction of commitment is frowned upon. For
   instance, it is not appreciated, generally, if one withdraws a promise
   or denies an earlier statement. Critical discussion, too, can easily be
   disrupted by retractions, if these occur too frequently and at critical
   points. But on the other hand, the very goal of critical discussion -
   resolution of a dispute - involves a retraction, either of doubt, or of
   some expressed point of view. A person who never retracts, not even
   under pressure of cogent arguments, would hardly qualify as a reasonable
   discussant. Also, inconsistencies in one's position, once they have been
   pointed out, must be dealt with by some kind of retraction. The problem
   of retraction is to find a suitable model of dialogue that allows
   retractions where they seem reasonable, or even required, and rules them
   out (or puts sanctions upon them) whenever they would become disruptive
   of a well-organized process of dialogue. The present paper tries to
   point to a solution based on the following principles: (1) Retraction
   rules determine what retractions are permissible, and (2) if permissible
   what the consequences of retraction are. (3) Retraction rules vary
   according to the type of dialogue and (4) according to the type of
   commitment retracted. For instance, assertions and mere concessions need
   to be distinguished, as well as light-side and dark-side commitments.
   (5) To account for our contradictory intuitions on the issue of
   retractions, one may best resort to a complex type of dialogue in which
   different retraction rules hold for different parts. The paper explains.
   summarizes, and expands upon the discussion of retraction in Commitment
   in Dialogue by Douglas Walton and the present author (cf. Walton and
   Krabbe 1995).{*}},

Abstract = {The paper aims to propose the fixed point property(FPP for short) of

   the n-dimensional Khalimsky space denoted by (Z(n); kappa(n)). Although
   not every connected Khalimsky topological space (X; kappa(n)(X)) has the
   FPP, we prove that for every point x is an element of Z(n) the smallest
   open K-topological neighborhood of x, denoted by SNK(x) subset of (Z(n);
   kappa(n)), has the FPP. Besides, the present paper also studies the
   almost fixed point property (AFPP, for brevity) of a K-topological

Abstract = {In 2011, this journal published the paper `A Boltzmann transformation

   vapour permeability via the Boltzmann-Matano method. This critique
   points out that this publication is flawed, since it proposes an invalid
   approach and presents erroneous results. The analysis first shows that
   the presented vapour permeability values cannot be reproduced and
   instead far lower vapour transport properties are obtained. These
   corrected outcomes are however also much below the dry-cup reference
   values, and it is established that these deviations stem from the
   invalidity of the proposed approach, due to disregarding the material's
   hygroscopicity. Given its erroneous results and invalid approach, it is
   finally recommended to have the paper officially retracted by the

Abstract = {In this paper, we present experimental results on how minute droplets
   are formed on fiber optic end faces. Results show that reproducible
   picoliter volumes can be generated when fibers are retracted from an
   aqueous phase contained under an inert fluorinated immiscible liquid,
   with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.7-2.3\%. The droplet formation
   was analyzed as a function of the fiber diameter, retraction speed, and
   wettability. Experiments reveal a volume-determining critical

   republished in this journal. Seralini et al found that a GM maize and
   its associated herbicide Roundup resulted in numerous chronic
   abnormalities in rats. The vehemence of the critics is not matched by
   their evidence; it is often based on entrenched assumptions and on
   mis-representing published material. The arguments have challenged
   normal healthy scientific dialogue, and appear to be driven by other
   motives. A further interpretation of Seralini et al's results on tumour
   formation is suggested. The probability that Seralini et al's results
   are significant is sufficient to justify further study.},

Abstract = {A recent incident at the Eastman Chemical Company's Kingsport site
   involved a 20 foot section of PTFE-lined pipe that failed at a flange
   joint, resulting in a leak, but no injuries. Initial scene observations
   indicated that a section of the liner had disintegrated, leaning an open
   space where the liner forms the flange gasket. More detailed analysis
   showed that the entire liner was intact, but had retracted approximately
   2.5 inches into the pipe.
   This paper will discuss the physical mechanisms (thermal cycling,
   viscoelastic properties of PTFE) that explain the liner retraction, as
   well as the installation factors (electrical tracing, liner length),
   which influenced the timing and nature of the failure mechanism.},

Title = {The influence of astrocytic leaflet motility on ionic signalling and
   homeostasis at active synapses},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Astrocytes display a highly complex, spongiform morphology, with their
   fine terminal processes (leaflets) exercising dynamic degrees of
   synaptic coverage, from touching and surrounding the synapse to being
   retracted from the synaptic region. In this paper, a computational model
   is used to reveal the effect of the astrocyte-synapse spatial
   relationship on ionic homeostasis. Specifically, our model predicts that
   varying degrees of astrocyte leaflet coverage influences concentrations
   of K+, Na+ and Ca2+, and results show that leaflet motility strongly
   influences Ca2+ uptake, as well as glutamate and K+ to a lesser extent.
   Furthermore, this paper highlights that an astrocytic leaflet that is in
   proximity to the synaptic cleft loses the ability to form a Ca2+
   microdomain, whereas when the leaflet is remote from the synaptic cleft,
   a Ca2+ microdomain can form. This may have implications for
   Ca2+-dependent leaflet motility.},

Abstract = {A semigroup prime of a commutative ring R is a prime ideal of the
   semigroup (R, .). One of the purposes of this paper is to study, from a
   topological point of view, the spaceS(R) of prime semigroups of R. We
   showthat, under a natural topology introduced by B. Olberding in 2010,
   S(R) is a spectral space (after Hochster), spectral extension of
   Spec(R), and that the assignment R (bar right arrow) S(R) induces a
   contravariant functor. We then relate-in the case R is an integral
   domain-the topology on S(R) with the Zariski topology on the set of
   overrings of R. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between
   S(R) and the space X(R) consisting of all nonempty inverse-closed
   subspaces of Spec(R), which has been introduced and studied in
   Finocchiaro et al. (submitted). In this context, we show that S(R) is a
   spectral retract of X(R) and we characterize when S(R) is canonically
   homeomorphic to X(R), both in general and when Spec(R) is a Noetherian
   space. In particular, we obtain that, when R is a Bezout domain, S(R) is
   canonically homeomorphic both to X(R) and to the space Overr(R) of the
   overrings of R (endowed with the Zariski topology). Finally, we compare
   the space X(R) with the space S(R(T)) of semigroup primes of the Nagata
   ring R(T), providing a canonical spectral embedding X(R) (bar right
   arrow) S(R(T)) which makes X(R) a spectral retract of S(R(T)).},

Abstract = {Defeasible argumentation is typical of legal and scientific reasoning. A
   defeasible argument is one in which the conclusion can be accepted
   tentatively in relation with the evidence known so far, but may need to
   be retracted as new evidence comes in. This paper analyses the role of
   defeasible argumentation in the explanation and evaluation of
   architectural decisions. We analyse technical explanations offered by
   engineers at Twitter and eBay about several architectural decisions
   adopted in those systems. We generalize these examples in four
   argumentation schemes. We also study the typical case of reasoning with
   a formal model of an architecture, and we infer a fifth argumentation
   scheme. Finally, we apply Hastings' method of attaching a set of
   critical questions to each scheme. We show that the existence of
   critical questions reveals that the inferred schemes are defeasible: in
   argumentation theory, if a respondent asks one of the critical questions
   matching a scheme and the proponent of an argument fails to offer an
   adequate answer, the argument defaults and the conclusion is retracted.
   This dialogical structure is the basis of typical architectural
   evaluations. We conclude that the provided evidence supports the
   hypothesis that defeasible argumentation is employed in architectural
   evaluation. In this context, a rich catalogue of argumentation schemes
   is a useful tool for the architect to organize his or her reasoning;
   critical questions assist the architect in identifying the weak points
   of his or her explanations, and provide the evaluation team with a
   checklist of issues to be raised.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the singular initial-value problem

   y(2) (0(+)) = 0.
   A nonuniqueness result is derived by a generalization of Wazewski's
   retract technique. In contrast to known nonuniqueness criteria which use
   comparison theory combined with Lyapunov functions, the presented method
   does not require the construction of auxiliary functions for concrete
   problems. The essential monotonicity assumptions can be easily verified.
   In addition, the type of nonuniqueness can be specified. The initial
   point of the given system is a special branching point. Some necessary
   existence conditions are analysed as well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In his well-known Knowledge Argument (KA) Frank Jackson attempted to
   show that physicalism is false by offering a case that allegedly showed
   that a complete physicalist description of the world leaves something
   crucial out, namely the phenomenal qualities of experience. Eventually
   Jackson himself retracted and claimed that the interesting task is to
   explain where and why intuition-pumping arguments against physicalism
   such as the KA go wrong. This is exactly the task that occupies this
   paper: to discuss and criticize three of the most important diagnoses of
   the KA's weak points and to offer my own view about the latter. Along
   the way, several important but often neglected features of the KA are
   expounded and clarified.},

Abstract = {A pair of Banach spaces (X, Y) is said to be coarsely stable if for
   every coarse Lipschitz embedding f:X -> Y, there exist alpha,gamma>0 and
   a Lipschitz mapping T:L(f)-> X with its Lipschitz constant TLip <=alpha
   such that Tf(x)-x <=gamma for all x is an element of X, where L(f) is
   the closed linear span of f(X). In this paper, we study the coarse
   stability of a pair of Banach spaces (X, Y) when X is an absolute
   Lipschitz retract (resp. X is an arbitrary Banach space; L2)and Y is an
   arbitrary Banach space (resp. Y is a Hilbert space; Lp for
   2<p<+infinity).},

Abstract = {A typical retractable mechanism for rigid solar array consisting of
   several panels, is addressed in the paper. Two continuous cables, which
   are used to deploy and retract the solar array respectively, are
   analyzed according to multi-body dynamics. For the motion
   synchronization between each panel, the Closed Synchro Loops (CSLs)
   mount on fixed pulleys is necessary in the mechanism. Firstly, the
   analytical model of two types of cable-pulley were proposed and studied
   from statics. And then, the whole model of the mechanism is built, and
   is deeply studied in view of dynamics. All the simulation results of the
   dynamics are beneficial to the optimal design of the cable-driven
   mechanism in near future.},

   and prove a formerly proposed (and retracted) framework that was shown
   to be unprovable with the classical OT functionality. Our functionality
   still remains reasonably close to natural expectation for Oblivious
   Transfer. Once our global framework is proven in the new functionality,
   we propose two instantiations using recent code-based candidates of the
   NIST post-quantum standardization process. We show that the resulting
   instantiations are both efficient and secure. Our new functionality
   opens the way to round-optimal oblivious transfer instantiations.},

   connecting between their joints to constraint direction of motion.
   Several cobots have been developed in recent years. All have fix
   configurations and some will be reviewed. In this paper, we propose a
   novel transformable Cobot, called T-Cobot which is able to expand or
   retract its configuration. Design and construction of T-Cobot prototype
   is described. Then, kinematics is presented with computer simulation. In
   addition, experiment results in free and path mode are provided.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a three-fingered nine-degrees-of-freedom hand whose
   parts can be inserted through trocars and assembled inside the abdominal
   cavity. Unlike other studies of surgery robots, this study focuses on a
   nondominant hand of a surgeon and its goal is to develop a robotic hand
   that can carry out assistive tasks for surgery, as if the human
   nondominant hand existed in the abdominal cavity. Another advantage of
   such a robotic hand is that it can grasp and retract large internal
   organs. The assemblage of the developed hand consists of center, right,
   and left finger units. The center finger unit is inserted through one
   trocar, and the right and left finger units are inserted through another
   trocar and then passed through the trocar, where the center finger unit
   is inserted. Then, the three finger units are connected to form the
   hand. One notable advantage of this assembly procedure is that the power
   transmission used to drive the finger joints is connected outside the
   abdominal cavity, which makes assembly and disassembly much easier and
   safer than the previously proposed hand. Although the hand has no wrist,
   its three finger joints play the role of a wrist joint. In vivo
   experiments demonstrate that the assembly procedure is simple, and that
   the hand can be made to grasp, hold up, and retract large internal
   organs, such as small intestine and spleen, by manipulating its joints
   in such a way that the hand fits the shape of the organ.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY},

Pages = {1365-1444},
Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a paracyclic version of S-modules. These new
   objects are called para-S-modules. Paracyclic modules and parachain
   complexes give rise to para-S-modules much in the same way as cyclic
   modules and mixed complexes give rise to S-modules. More generally,
   para-S-modules provide us with a natural framework to get analogues for
   paracyclic modules and parachain complexes of various constructions and
   equivalence results for cyclic modules or mixed complexes. The datum of
   a para-S-module does not provide us with a chain complex, and so notions
   of homology and quasi-isomorphisms do not make sense. However, chain
   maps and chain homotopies continue to make sense, and so by equivalences
   we actually mean chain homotopy equivalences. We establish some
   generalizations for para-S-modules and parachain complexes of the basic
   perturbation lemma of differential homological algebra. These
   generalizations provide us with general recipes for converting
   deformation retracts of Hoschschild chain complexes into deformation
   retracts of para-S-modules. By using ideas of Kassel this then allows us
   to get comparison results between the various para-S-modules associated
   with para-precyclic modules, and between them and Connes' cyclic chain
   complex. These comparison results lead us to alternative descriptions of
   Connes' periodicity operator. This has some applications in periodic
   cyclic homology. We also describe the counterparts of these results in
   cyclic cohomology. In particular, we obtain an explicit way to convert a
   periodic (b, B)-cocycle into a cohomologous periodic cyclic cocycle.},

Abstract = {The use of endoscopic techniques has gained significant popularity over
   the past decade. The potential advantages of angled lenses to visualize
   around tight corridors without retracting have proven to be an
   attractive feature. The limitation of endoscopy has been the inability
   to obtain a true three-dimensional perspective for which microscopy is
   ideal. Therefore we postulated that for complex intradural lesions the
   merger of the two technologies would prove to be ideal. In this paper we
   report our experience with simultaneous microscopy and endoscopy, using
   picture-in-picture technology, for intracranial vascular and oncological
   surgery. We have found it useful to offer enough visualization to allow
   for performing surgery and not just for inspection.},

Abstract = {Transactional memory has arisen as a good way for solving many of the
   issues of lock-based programming. However, most implementations admit
   isolated transactions only, which are not adequate when we have to
   coordinate communicating processes. To this end, in this paper we
   present OCTM, an Haskell-like language with open transactions over
   shared transactional memory: processes can join transactions at runtime
   just by accessing to shared variables. Thus a transaction can co-operate
   with the environment through shared variables, but if it is rolled-back,
   also all its effects on the environment are retracted. For proving the
   expressive power of OCTM we give an implementation of TCCSm, a CCS-like
   calculus with open transactions.},

Abstract = {This paper contains a new algorithm that recognizes whether a given
   graph G is a Hamming graph, i.e. a Cartesian product of complete graphs,
   in O(m) time and O(n(2)) space. Here m and n denote the numbers of edges
   and vertices of G, respectively. Previously this was only possible in
   O(m log n) time. Moreover, we present a survey of other recognition
   algorithms for Hamming graphs, retracts of Hamming graphs and isometric
   subgraphs of Hamming graphs. Special emphasis is also given to the
   bipartite case in which these classes are reduced to binary Hamming
   graphs, median graphs and partial binary Hamming graphs. (C) 1996

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present an algebraic generalization of
   the traditional two-valued logic. This involves introducing a theory of
   automorphism algebras, which is an algebraic theory of many-valued logic
   having a complete lattice as the set of truth values. Two
   generalizations of the two-valued case will be considered. viz., the
   finite chain and the Boolean lattice. In the case of the Boolean
   lattice, on choosing a designated lattice value, this algebra has binary
   retracts that have the usual axiomatic theory of the propositional
   calculus as suitable theory This suitability applies to the Boolean
   algebra of formalized token models {[}2] where the truth values are, for
   example, vocabularies. Finally. as the actual motivation for this paper.
   we indicate how the theory of formalized token models {[}2] is an
   example of a many-valued predicate calculus.},

Abstract = {This paper reports a tensegrity manipulator driven by 40 pneumatic
   cylinders without mechanical springs. In general, tensegrity robots use
   mechanical springs to achieve a stable/curved tensegrity structure, and
   this is true even when a component extends/retracts with an actuator.
   The stiffness of the mechanical spring should be high to increase the
   stiffness of the entire structure and improve the control response, but
   low to deform the structure. This fact means that the introduction of
   mechanical springs causes serious trade-offs in its design and control.
   In this study, we use pneumatic actuators not only for active
   deformation but also for passive. In this paper, we introduce the design
   and control system and then show the difference in response
   characteristics between the case with and without a spring,
   demonstrating the importance of the approach without a mechanical
   spring.},

Abstract = {To ensure the aerodynamic performance of the slat in aircraft when
   retracted, it is necessary to set rubber seals in the seam between the
   leading-edge slat and the fixed leading edge. However, the extrusion and
   friction of the seal will induce the increment frictional loading on the
   slat driver. In the present Paper, a rigid-flexible body configuration
   model of the increment frictional loading was proposed based on
   multibody dynamics and theory of elasticity, and the increment
   frictional loading caused by the slat seal was calculated and analyzed.
   Besides, the influences of friction coefficient and temperature on the
   incremental frictional loading were investigated. The results will
   provide a guidance reference in simulation analysis and experimental
   verification methods for designing the slat seals in aircraft.},

   compact or bounded and separable and suppose that E has both (FPP) and
   (CFPP), then for any commuting family S of nonexpansive self-mappings of

   retract of E. In this paper, we extend the above result when one of its

   results (on common fixed points of a pair of single valued and
   multivalued commuting mappings) to infinite number of mappings and to a

Title = {LNTgate: How LNT benefited from editorial actions},
Journal = {CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {362},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {This paper illustrates how the acceptance of the linear non-threshold
   (LNT) dose response model was unethically advocated and advanced both by
   key scientists within the radiation genetics community, and by editorial
   practices in Science, a leading international scientific journal. Four
   key papers became the cornerstones in the acceptance of the LNT model.
   In the publication process of these papers, editorial decisions to
   circumvent peer review occurred in at least two cases. As well, the
   summarized data of one paper were never shared with the scientific
   community and remain missing to date. Publication of a paper in Science
   on which a senior editor of the journal was a co-author is alleged to
   have intentionally falsified the research record (BEAR Genetics Panel).
   These findings raise the question of whether foundational papers for
   major contemporary regulatory policy (i.e., LNT/cancer risk assessment)
   that lack scientific legitimacy, as identified herein, should be
   retracted. These findings also should serve as the basis for
   considerable ethical concern, as well as a prompt for ongoing ethical
   diligence and rigor in the conduct and publication of scientific
   research.},

Title = {First syllable vowels in Surgut Khanty according to the ultrasonography
   data},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This paper describes the Surgut Khanty vowel articulation by
   ultrasonography methods. 193 vowel segments were sampled by Articulate
   Instruments equipment and processed with Articulate Assistant Advanced
   software. 97 consonant segments were recorded to estimate a contact
   influence of vowels on consonants. The data were collected from a woman,
   a Tromagan dialect native speaker born in 1970. The tongue contours were
   analyzed by certain features: the highest point and its coordinates, the
   most remote point and its distance from the coordinate center. The most
   distant point was found to allow distinguishing three basic tongue
   movement types according to J. Esling's laryngeal articulator theory:
   front movement correlates with phonemes /i:/, /i:/, partial
   derivative./, /epsilon/, raised movement correlates with phonemes
   /upsilon:/, /partial derivative:/, /./partial derivative /o/, a
   combination of these two types yields /u/, /i:/, /o:/, and retracted
   movement is characteristic of phonemes /a:/, /a/. The vocal movement
   types can be differentiated by the most distant point number. The points
   1-8 are placed in the frontal part of the dorsum, the points 9-16 are in
   the middle part, the points 17-24 are placed in the back part. Front
   vowels have the most distant point in the range 14-17. Retracted vowels
   and combination of front and raised position are characterized by 18-19
   and raised vowels by 19-20. The distance of tongue shift within each
   type allows distinguishing individual phonemes. The radical plosive
   phoneme was proved experimentally to have velar allophone {[}k] and
   uvular allophone {[}q] depending on the vowel row.},

Title = {Strain-induced crystallization of natural rubber as detected real-time
   by wide-angle X-ray diffraction technique},
Journal = {POLYMER},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {41},
Number = {14},
Pages = {5423-5429},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the past, the stress-strain behavior of natural rubber has been
   studied by a variety of mechanical analytical techniques in order to
   understand the role of induced crystallization by deformation. But, this
   was generally done in a sequential manner by stretching to a certain
   extent and examining the stretched part separately. This type of
   sequential experiment may not follow the exact dynamics of the process
   and thus may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the evolution of
   microscopic mechanisms. It is therefore advantageous to measure the
   mechanical response simultaneously with the structural response to map
   the structural evolution onto the stress-strain behavior. In this paper,
   simultaneous measurements of the stress-strain behavior and X-ray
   scattering intensity of vulcanized natural rubber were made continuously
   by a specially designed instrument during elongation and subsequent
   retraction. These studies revealed three new characteristics of the
   strain-induced crystallization. 1. The strain-induced crystallization
   starts at around 400\% strain at 25 degrees C, then increases steeply,
   although sequential measurements reported that natural rubber starts
   strain-induced crystallization at 200\%. 2. At the onset of retracting,
   the degree of crystallinity continues to increase, although a drastic
   decrease of stress occurs. We suggest the morphology of the
   strain-induced crystallites changes such that do not contribute to
   stress. 3. Strain-induced crystallites disappear at the strain where the
   stress-strain loop is closed during retracting. The hysteresis of the
   stress-strain curve might be attributed to strain-induced
   crystallization. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper I will compare two competing accounts of assertion: the

   evidence that is typically used to assess accounts of
   assertion-including the evidence from lottery propositions, the evidence
   from Moore's paradoxical propositions and the evidence from
   conversational patterns-I will argue that the justified belief account
   has at least as much explanatory power as its rival. I will argue,
   finally, that a close look at the ways in which assertions can be
   challenged and retracted reveals a certain advantage for the justified
   belief account. The paper will touch upon a number of further topics
   along the way, including the logical interaction between knowledge and
   justified belief, the nature of defeat, and the hypothesis that
   knowledge and justified belief are normatively coincident goals.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the sustainability of urban housing in the European

   affordability and food production. Utilizing the 2007 tranche of the
   European Quality of Life Survey, it finds significant variations between
   countries in the sustainability of urban housing and communities and
   highlights the leaders and laggards in this regard. The relative success
   of urban areas in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Finland deserves some
   additional research, although there is scope for considerable
   improvement even in these ``leader{''} countries. The paper highlights
   significant problems with housing and communities in some urban
   locations which must significantly retract from (a) the quality of life
   of residents in these locations and (b) the sustainability of their

Title = {The ANTI-order for caccc posets .1.},
Journal = {DISCRETE MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {This paper deals with a generalization of the following simple
   observation. Suppose there are distinct elements a, b of the chain
   complete poset (P, less than or equal to) such that P(< a) subset of or
   equal to P(< b) and P(> a) subset of or equal to P(> b); if P(< a) and
   P(> a) are both fixed point free (fpf), then P is also fpf (we say P is
   trivially fpf), otherwise, P has the fixed point property (fpp) if and
   only if P\textbackslash{}\{a\} has this property. We introduce a new
   quasi-order on a poset (P, less than or equal to), called the ANTI-order
   denoted by much less than or equal to, where x much less than or equal
   to y holds if and only if every element strictly comparable with x is
   also strictly comparable with y. A set X subset of or equal to P is an
   ANTI-good subset of P, if X is maximal (with respect to inclusion) and
   its elements are much less than or equal to-maximal and pairwise much
   less than or equal to-incomparable. A poset (P, less than or equal to)
   is caccc if it is chain complete and every countably infinite antichain
   has a supremum (infimum) whenever the antichain is bounded above
   (below). The caccc property is preserved by retracts and the
   intersection of a decreasing chain of caccc subposets also has this
   property. We show that for a caccc poset (P, less than or equal to) an
   ANTI-good subset is a retract and it is uniquely determined up to
   isomorphism. Moreover, if P is not trivially fpf, then P has the fpp if
   and only if an ANTI-good subset has the fpp. A strictly decreasing
   sequence, Pi = {[}P-xi: xi less than or equal to lambda], of subsets of
   a caccc poset P is called an ANTI-perfect sequence of P, if P = P-0 and,
   for each xi < lambda, P-xi+1 is a much less than or equal to(xi)-good
   subset of P-xi, where much less than or equal to(xi) is the ANTI-order
   on P-xi and P-xi = boolean AND\{P-eta: eta < xi\} when xi is a limit
   ordinal, and P-lambda is a much less than or equal to(lambda)-good
   subset of itself. We call P-lambda an ANTI-core of P. Our main result is
   that an ANTI-core of a caccc poset is a retract. The proof of this will
   be given separately in the second part of the paper {[}5]. In this part
   we establish the existence of ANTI-perfect sequences.},

   Cues for discussion from a case study},

Abstract = {This paper takes the cue from the case of a retracted paper, cited both
   by the retraction notice and by an article published later in the same
   journal. This led to analysis and discussion on the skewness of
   citations in the journal Sustainability and within Multidisciplinary
   Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) journals, particularly investigating
   self-citations at journal and publisher levels. I analysed articles
   published by Sustainability in 2015 and found that self-citations are
   higher than expected under a uniform probability distribution.
   Self-citations in this journal make a 36\% difference to the journal's
   impact factor. This research raises the question of what citation
   patterns can be expected as normal, and where the boundary between
   normal and anomaly lies. I suggest the issue deserves further
   investigation because self-citations have several implications, ranging
   from impact factors to visibility and influence of scientific journals.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper we investigate the structure of semigroups with the ideal
   retraction property i.e., semigroups which are not simple and have the
   property that each ideal is a homomorphic retract of the semigroup.
   We present examples to show that the ideal retraction property is
   neither hereditary nor productive. That this property is preserved by
   homomorphisins is established for some classes of semigroups, but the
   general question remains open.
   The classes of semigroups investigated in this paper are separative
   semigroups, ideal semigroups, semilattices, cyclic semigroups, nil
   semigroups, and Clifford semigroups.
   It is established that a semigroup with zero 0 which is expressible as a
   direct sum of each ideal and a dual ideal (complement with 0 adjoined)
   has the ideal retraction property. The converse holds for ideal
   semigroups, and an example is presented which demonstrates that the
   converse does not hold in general.},

Abstract = {Astrocytes are a non-homogeneous cell type, highly mobile which
   constantly extend and retract their cytoplasmic processes in what would
   seem random in direction. In this paper, we investigate how simple
   geometric microshapes can be used to control the outgrowth of human
   astrocytes cytoplasmic processes. We investigate the effect of how five
   regular microshapes: the circle, triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon
   control astrocyte cytoplasmic process outgrowth. For all the different
   microshape types, we observe that it is the corners of the shapes that
   that cause the astrocyte to produce spontaneous outgrowth except for the
   circle where the outgrowth occurs at a random radial position. This work
   suggests that the geometry of cell adhesive regions effects the
   outgrowth of hNT astrocytes.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the contact of an infinitely extended plane

   self-consistent approach with surface (traditional formulation) and
   volumetric (refined formulation) application of intermolecular
   interaction forces. Equations that describe the time change in the
   contact gap for such a contact are obtained. A condition, under which an
   abrupt time change in the contact gap is possible, is formulated.
   Calculations that indicate the nonmonotonic nature of the time
   dependences of the contact gap and pressure in the indenter approach and
   retract modes are performed. It is shown that the traditional and
   refined problem formulations can lead to significantly different results
   of calculating the characteristics of the contact between the indenter
   and the viscoelastic layer.},

   involve dynamically introduced or retracted assumptions: `reasoning by
   assumption'. It is shown for this type of reasoning how relevant dynamic
   properties at different levels of aggregation can be identified as
   requirements that characterize the reasoning capability. A software
   agent has been built that performs this type of reasoning. The dynamic
   properties have been expressed using the temporal trace language TTL and
   can and have been checked automatically for sample traces.},

   monomorphisms. Then, we present some adjoint relations of Pos-S with
   Pos, Set, and Act-S. In particular, we discuss free and cofree objects.
   We also examine other category-theoretic properties, such as cartesian
   closedness and monadicity. Finally, we consider projectivity in Pos-S
   with respect to regular epimorphisms and show that it is the same
   asprojectivity, although projectives are not generally retracts of free
   objects over posets.},

Abstract = {Let K be an algebraically closed field and A(n) congruent to K-n affine
   n-space. It is known that a finite group G can only act freely on A(n)
   if K has characteristic p > 0 and G is a p-group. In that case the group
   action is ``non-linear{''} and the ring of regular functions K{[}A(n)]
   must be a trace-surjective K - G-algebra.
   Now let k be an arbitrary field of characteristic p > 0 and let G be a
   finite p-group. In this paper we study the category Ts of all finitely
   generated trace-surjective k - G algebras. It has been shown in {[}13]
   that the objects in Ts are precisely those finitely generated k - G
   algebras A such that A(G)<= A is a Galois-extension in the sense of
   {[}7], with faithful action of G on A. Although Ts is not an abelian
   category it has ``s-projective objects{''}, which are analogues of
   projective modules, and it has (s-projective) categorical generators,
   which we will describe explicitly. We will show that s-projective
   objects and their rings of invariants are retracts of polynomial rings
   and therefore regular UFDs. The category Ts also has ``weakly initial
   objects{''}, which are closely related to the essential dimension of G
   over k. Our results yield a geometric structure theorem for free actions
   of finite p-groups on affine kvarieties. There are also close
   connections to open questions on retracts of polynomial rings, to
   embedding problems in standard modular Galois-theory of p-groups and,
   potentially, to a new constructive approach to homogeneous invariant
   theory.},

Abstract = {Robotic bronchoscopy has the potential to improve the early detection of
   lung cancer. For the technology to be broadly adopted, the physician
   needs to be able to control the robotic bronchoscope in an instinctive
   and effective manner. In this paper, we describe the algorithms used to
   manipulate/drive the Auris Monarch Platform, a 10 degree-of-freedom
   bronchoscope and sheath, using a 3 degree-of-freedom user input. We
   introduce the concept of paired driving where the devices co-insert and
   co-articulate depending on their relative insertion. The paper presents
   safety algorithms such as auto-relax on retract and tension monitoring.
   The drive modes were developed, optimized, and clinically tested in lung
   models, human cadavers and live porcine models prior to their commercial
   release. Clinical studies show that the physician is able to reach
   significantly deeper in the lung than with classic bronchoscopes.},

Abstract = {Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is the infectious disease caused by
   the recently discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. This new virus and
   disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in
   December 2019. The number of publications with regard to
   COVID-19-related information is exponentially increasing, but there are
   also some retracted papers appearing on PubMed, including those
   retracted from The Lancet Global Health and the New England Journal of
   Medicine. In a PubMed search for ``COVID,{''} there were 1595 articles
   by April 1, 2020. As of June 30, the number of articles has now reached
   25,913.
   In this editorial, 4 specific areas of information are looked at but the
   principles apply to many other areas of medicine. The specifics looked
   at are PPE for tracheostomy, testing for COVID-19, pregnancy and
   COVID-19, and surgical expectations during redeployment.
   We must make no mistake that we are seeing a disease that modern
   medicine has never encountered before.
   This article is not aimed at belittling or dismissing any of the advice
   of the Royal Colleges' or PHE advice, but it demonstrates the tsunami of
   information and the ambiguity that surgeons are experiencing throughout
   the UK right now.
   This is unlikely to be the end of progression regarding healthcare
   planning and development for unencountered viruses9. In the next few
   months and beyond, there are likely to be adaptions and revisions of
   more documents advising on various aspects of healthcare with regard to
   COVID-19 management and for possible future viruses not yet seen by the
   modern world before. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {For the velocity control of an asymmetric hydraulic actuator the
   servovalve is not operated in the vicinity of zero. Thus the linearized
   model is not easily defined and the classical controller cannot be
   readily found. Also, because of its asymmetry, a fixed reference model
   of adaptive control cannot result in optimal performances for both
   directions.
   In this paper, to minimize the performance index associated with the
   estimated model and control penalty, the self-optimization
   alpha-adaptive control shows an ability to adapt to variations in
   directions and operating conditions. Thus it win provide similarly
   optimal performances for both extending and retracting processes. Then,
   comparing with the variable gain control, the experimental results
   clearly show its superior performance and disturbance rejection.},

   bases his paper on a paper by Demjanov that has already been retracted

   relativistic light speed in arbitrary media as opposed to the incorrect
   ones given in V. P. Dmitriyev, Z. Naturforsch. 66a, 228 (2011). We will
   follow by explaining the correct equations of the Michelson Morley

Abstract = {A flat stick-shaped whip antenna was developed for Japanese commercial
   portable telephones. It provides a high gain even though it is short and
   retractable. It is an open-sleeve type antenna, i.e., the
   inductance-loaded dipole-antenna element parallels a twin-lead type
   feeder. It suppresses the currents on the radio housing even at short
   antenna lengths. Moreover, it is easy to achieve two resonant
   characteristics and able to construct retractable type. A relatively
   high gain is gotten even when the antenna is in a retracted state. This
   antenna has a suitable configuration for commercial portable telephones.
   This paper first calculates, the current suppression of the housing on a
   principal model of this antenna, i.e., without a twin-lead feeder. The
   second analysis determines the effects of the twin-lead feeder and the
   dielectric coat on the antenna. Next, the two resonant technique and the
   configuration for the retractable-type antenna describes. In addition,
   the return loss and radiation pattern for the trial model were measured.
   The return loss shows that the two resonant characteristics and the
   bandwidths of the high and low resonant frequencies are 2.2\% and 1.5\%
   (VSWR< 2), respectively. For when the antenna is extended, radiation
   patterns are nearly the same as for the case of the 1/2 wavelength
   dipole antenna, and the antenna efficiencies are -1.6 dB at 820 MHz and
   -1.1 dB at 950 MHz. Other hand, for the retracted state, they are
   destroyed by the housing currents, but the efficiency is relatively high
   of -1.8 dB at 950 MHz. In these experiments, it is clear that the
   antenna achieves high performances.},

   first humanist to make use of his knowledge in antiquarianism to better
   understand passages of meals in the Gospels, according to the Latin text
   of the Vulgata. He showed it in his book De arte gymnastica (1573), 2nd
   edition, chapter I, XI. Notwithstanding, Fulvio Orsini published the
   same contents in his work De triclinio (1588), where he incorporated as
   well some old drafts of the already died Spanish Pedro Chacon (dagger
   1581). As soon as De triclinio was published, Mercuriale accused Orsini
   and Chacon of plagiarism. However, in 1601 he nearly refused his
   originality in the topic. This paper deals with the possible reasons of
   retracting and the context of this controversy.},

Abstract = {A closure endomorphism of a Hilbert algebra A is a mapping that is
   simultaneously an endomorphism of and a closure operator on A. It is
   known that the set CE of all closure endomorphisms of A is a
   distributive lattice where the meet of two elements is defined pointwise
   and their join is given by their composition. This lattice is shown in
   the paper to be isomorphic to the lattice of certain filters of A,
   anti-isomorphic to the lattice of certain closure retracts of A, and
   compactly generated. The set of compact elements of CE coincides with
   the adjoint semilattice of A; conditions under which two Hilbert
   algebras have isomorphic adjoint semilattices (equivalently, minimal
   Brouwerian extensions) are discussed. Several consequences are drawn
   also for implication algebras.},

Journal = {TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 25},
Abstract = {This paper raises a new form of speaker error objection to the analysis
   of disputes as metalinguistic negotiations in cases in which disputants
   reject that analysis. It focuses on an obvious but underexplored form of
   speaker error: speakers' misattribution of contents both to others and
   to themselves. It argues that the analyses of disputes that posit this
   type of speaker error are uncharitable in three different ways: first,
   by portraying speakers as mistaken interpreters of their interlocutors;
   second, by portraying speakers as uncharitable interpreters of their
   interlocutors; third, by portraying speakers who retract their claims as
   mistaken interpreters of their own prior utterances. Taken together,
   these unfavorable consequences weigh significantly against the
   plausibility of this type of analysis for the cases in question.},

   conditions on the fundamental group which guarantee a positive answer to
   the Borsuk question. On the other end, we construct various examples of
   compact h-equal, not homotopy equivalent continua, with distinct
   properties. The first class of these examples has trivial all known
   algebraic invariants (such as homology, homotopy groups etc.) The second
   class is given by n-connected continua, for any n, which are infinite
   CW-complexes, and hence ANR spaces, on a complement of a point.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a single defect in graphene was created by an Au
   nanoparticle attached to atomic force tip working in tapping mode. Then
   it was investigated by tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). The TERS
   tip interacted with the graphene are able to induce an atomic
   deformation of carbonic structure which then can be recovered after
   retracting the tip. The reversible defect was confirmed by the iterative
   observation of D-band Raman signal of graphene as the tip force on and
   off. Further more, the Au particles as a nano-antenna can enhance the
   weak D-band signal from the single graphene defect significantly. These
   finds will give us better understanding of the origination of graphene
   defects and the interaction between nanoparticles and graphene.},

   dominating infinitely many different homotopy types (or equivalently,
   shapes). In this paper we show that every polyhedron with virtually
   polycyclic fundamental group has finite depth, i.e., there is a bound on
   the lengths of all descending sequences of different homotopy types (or
   shapes) dominated by this polyhedron. As a corollary, we deduce that for
   two ANR's with virtually polycyclic fundamental groups the so-called
   index of h-proximity, introduced by K. Borsuk in his monograph on
   retract theory, is finite. We also obtain an answer to some question of
   K. Borsuk concerning homotopy (or shape) decompositions of polyhedra

Abstract = {In many human robot cooperation tasks, robotic agents are usually
   controlled by commands which are explicitly input by human. Although the
   explicit control method is straightforward and easy to implement, it
   will decrease the efficiency, fluency and adaptiveness of human robot
   cooperation. In this paper, we proposed an implicit control method that
   recognizes human intention and facilitates human robot cooperation. A
   finite state machine approach was used to implement human intention
   recognition algorithm. Four assembly configurations were designed and
   intention recognition experiments were carried out by using simulation
   and real data respectively. We have shown that our method can flexibly
   adapt to human intention even if the human operator retracts some
   assembly parts and changes mind during the tasks. Furthermore, the
   robustness of our method has also been demonstrated in noisy situations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an implemented approach of processing situated
   dialogue between a human and a robot. The focus is on task-oriented
   dialogue, set in the larger context of human-robot collaborative
   activity. The approach models understanding and production of dialogue
   to include intension (what is being talked about), intention (the goal
   of why something is being said), and attention (what is being focused
   on). These dimensions are directly construed in terms of assumptions and
   assertions on situated multi-agent belief models. The approach is
   continual in that it allows for interpretations to be dynamically
   retracted, revised, or deferred. This makes it possible to deal with the
   inherent asymmetry in how robots and humans tend to understand dialogue,
   and the world in which it is set. The approach has been fully
   implemented, and integrated into a cognitive robot. The paper discusses
   the implementation, and illustrates it in a collaborative learning
   setting.},

Abstract = {The concept of the hydraulic infinite linear actuator consists of two
   double-acting cylinders with hydraulically detachable pistons driving a
   common rod. Alternatingly, one cylinder engages and drives the load,
   whereas the other retracts; the actuator, thus, works in a kind of
   rope-climbing motion. The actuator has three degrees of freedom, which
   are temporarily coupled compared with one in a conventional cylinder.
   Hence, the actuator is a hybrid system with both continuous and discrete
   states and control inputs. This paper presents a tracking control
   problem and a solution for high-performance motion, which is interpreted
   as utilizing the hardware limits in the sense of velocity, accuracy,
   smoothness, and usability. The concept is demonstrated by simulation for
   the case of a rest-to-rest motion, but the intended use cases also
   include arbitrary trajectories.},

Abstract = {Let Z(n) be the Cartesian product of the set of integers Z and let (Z,
   T) and (Z(n), T-n.) be the Khalimsky line topology on Z and the
   Khalimsky product topology on Z(n), respectively. Then for a set X
   subset of Z(n), consider the subspace (X, T-X(n)) induced from (Z(n),
   T-n). Considering a k-adjacency on (X, T-X(n)), we call it a (computer
   topological) space with k-adjacency and use the notation (X, k, T-X(n))
   := X-n,X-k. In this paper we introduce the notions of KD-(k(0),
   k(1))-homotopy equivalence and KD-k-deformation retract and investigate
   a classification of (computer topological) spaces X-n,X-k in terms of a
   KD-(k(0), k(1))-homotopy equivalence.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the design and development of a re-configurable
   dual-robot assembly system using off-the-shelf re-configurable pneumatic
   modules, Hall-effect sensors, a vision system, and a programmable logic
   controller (PLC). Each robot arm consists of three sets of pneumatic
   modules and a pneumatic gripper. Each module consists of a pneumatic
   housing, an air cylinder, and a Hall-effect sensor, and provides one
   degree of freedom. Solenoids are used to redirect airflow and thereby
   extend and/or retract the air cylinder. A vision system is used for
   fixture inspection. A conveyor and part stopper are designed to transfer
   and stop pallets. All these modules, the gripper, the part stopper, and
   the vision system are controlled and synchronized using a PLC. At the
   end of this paper, a framework for making the system over the Web for
   remote operation and diagnosis is proposed and described.},

Abstract = {Flying typically involves thrust or buoyancy in order to climb in
   altitude while trying to minimize drag. These setups can result in
   large, energy-exhaustive mechanisms. This paper presents a novel
   alternative to the traditional approaches of flying by utilizing
   aerodynamic drag. Drag can be used as an opposing force needed to lift a
   load off of the ground. The concept is verified through a series of
   experiments in which a balloon is used to lift a parachute to a desired
   height, and then an actuator with a load on the ground retracts a rope
   connected to the parachute. Aerodynamic drag is translated into a
   lifting force. This cost-effective, energy efficient, and modular method
   can increase the mobility of robots, delivery systems etc.},

   swallowing, applies the soft tissues of the tongue, lips, and cheeks
   against the hard tissues of the bones and teeth. This action molds the
   soft tissues, adapting them in accordance to the architecture of teeth

Abstract = {This paper describes the design, the construction and the control of a
   flexible surface that is able to shape arbitrary forms. From a hardware
   point of view, the surface is realized by fifty linear motors that are
   mounted beneath a latex foil and are capable of extending or retracting
   a piston. Through the correct position of each piston, the overall latex
   surface forms the desired shape. From the software side, three type of
   controllers are used: Synchronizing controllers that reduce the stress
   on the material, feedforward controllers that enable each motor to track
   a reference trajectory, and proportional-integral controllers to
   compensate for model uncertainties and mismatched initial conditions.
   The paper shows experiments in which the surface should form a
   travelling wave. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen
   controllers as the overall surface forms the desired shape with
   practically no tracking error.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the walking control problem of a compass-like
   biped robot with underactuated ankles in the framework of hybrid control
   systems. The compass-like biped robot is equipped with a constraint
   mechanism to lock the hip angle when the swing leg retracts. First,
   based on the Poincare return map, a limit cycle gait is obtained, and
   the stability of the gait is also checked. Then, a method based on
   transverse coordinate transformation is introduced to transform the
   problem of tracking a desired limit cycle into the stabilization problem
   of a linear time-invariant impulsive system. A feedback control design
   for stabilizing the walking gait is then presented. Finally, comparisons
   to several existing approaches for the similar model are provided to
   demonstrate the advantages of our proposed approach.},

Abstract = {Tapping-mode atomic force microscope (TM-AFM) is currently the most
   widely utilized instrument for atomic-resolution imaging and
   nano-manipulation. However, the complex cantilever-tip dynamics has not
   been fully understood due to the inherent nonlinear property of
   tip-sample interaction. Experiments and analytical techniques are two
   basic methods to investigate the nonlinear effects, but they are either
   too costly or requires extremely advanced mathematical and physical
   knowledge to apply. In this paper, we present an alternative solution
   for this problem by constructing a virtual tapping-mode AFM system built
   in Matlab-Simulink environment. As demonstrated in the paper, the
   virtual AFM is capable of performing various classic experiments in AFM
   including approach-retract, sweeping frequency, PID-based amplitude
   regulation etc. It also provides a numerical platform for research work
   to explore new ambitious control strategies aiming at improving the
   scanning speed and precision of the AFM system.},

Abstract = {The approach by competencies explains the articulation between training
   processes and the work market. Without an obvious epistemic position, in
   the last decades, the concept of competencies has evolved toward an
   important framework to consider the work's human talent in many
   countries. Likewise, with consideration of the framework as occupation
   and employability, the approach by competencies has expanded its use to
   different fields and knowledge areas, such as educational ones among
   them, with proposals that defend it and retract it. This paper proposes
   a theoretical review of the most important models of approach by
   competencies, and the relation between these models with the
   occupational guidance and its intervention models so that the
   professionals in the area can considerer their contributions to
   developing the processes they implement in different contexts,
   especially in educational ones.},

   correlations may be made between the elements of the discourse moving
   from the northern to the southern border, but not in the opposite
   direction; 2) the process of securitising the discourse about migrants
   is continuous, and new securitising elements are regularly added; 3) an
   ``elastic borders{''} phenomenon exists, where borders extend or
   retract, thereby creating new border regions; and 4) discourses around
   the southern border are constructed with more pejorative elements than
   the northern, despite the fact that crime rates are higher in the north.},

Abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides information not only about the level
   of expression of individual genes but also about genomic sequences of
   host cells. When we use transcriptome data with whole-genome single
   nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant information, the allele frequency
   can show the genetic composition of the cell population and/or
   chromosomal aberrations. Here, I show how SNPs in mRNAs can be used to
   evaluate RNA-seq experiments by focusing on RNA-seq data based on a
   recently retracted paper on stimulus-triggered acquisition of
   pluripotency (STAP) cells. The analysis indicated that different types
   of cells and chromosomal abnormalities might have been erroneously
   included in the dataset. This re-evaluation showed that observing allele
   frequencies could help in assessing the quality of samples during a
   study and with retrospective evaluation of experimental quality.},

Abstract = {In this paper we describe in detail the coordinated practices of walking
   away as reflexively contributing to the organization of activity
   closings. The paper contributes to conversation analytic studies
   interested in multimodality, space and mobility, by showing the
   relevance of walking for the systematic and situated organization of
   talk-in-interaction. More particularly, the paper deals with sequential
   environments in which activity closings are projected, and achieved by
   the participants; it shows that in this position, initiating walking
   away is a resource that makes closing publicly projectable and
   recognizable. Moreover, the study shows how walking away is a negotiated
   matter, being initiated by some, aligned or disaligned by others,
   possibly retracted and revised. Finally, the study demonstrates that
   walking away as a coordinated and negotiated practice raises normative
   expectations among the participants: a deviant case is discussed in
   which participants orient to the absence of such a coordination. In sum,
   the paper offers a detailed analysis of a particular multimodal practice
   walking as a conduct systematically coordinated with
   talk-in-interaction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with an online tethered coverage (TC), in which
   a mobile robot of size D is attached to a fixed point S by a cable of
   finite length L. Starting at S, the robot has to cover an unknown planar
   environment that contains obstacles and return to S with the cable fully
   retracted. The paper first establishes an optimal offline TC
   methodology, then introduces the TC algorithm that performs an online TC
   using position and local obstacle detection sensors. The performance of
   the TC algorithm is measured by its competitiveness, determined by
   measuring its total online path length l relative to the optimal offline
   solution l(opt). The paper establishes that the TC algorithm has a
   competitive performance of l <= 2 L/D l(opt). The paper additionally
   establishes a lower bound of l >= log(L/D)l(opt) over a generic family
   of TC algorithms of which the TC algorithm is a special case. Execution
   example and experiments with a tethered recoiling mechanism illustrate
   the usefulness of the TC algorithm.},

Title = {Effect of different typical high speed train pantograph recess
   configurations on aerodynamic noise},

Abstract = {For high-speed trains, the aerodynamic noise becomes an essential
   consideration in the train design. The pantograph and pantograph recess
   are recognised as important sources of aerodynamic noise. This paper
   studies the flow characteristics and noise contributions of three
   typical high-speed train roof configurations, namely a cavity, a ramped
   cavity and a flat roof with side insulation plates. The Improved Delayed
   Detached-Eddy Simulation approach is used for the flow calculations and
   the Ffowcs Williams \& Hawkings aeroacoustic analogy is used for
   far-field acoustic predictions. Simulations are presented for a
   simplified train body at 1/10 scale and 300 km/h with these three roof
   configurations. In each case, two simplified pantographs (one retracted
   and one raised) are located on the roof. Analysis of the flow fields
   obtained from numerical simulations clearly shows the influence of the
   train roof configuration on the flow behaviour, including flow
   separations, reattachment and vortex shedding, which are potential noise
   sources. A highly unsteady flow occurs downstream when the train roof
   has a cavity or ramped cavity due to flow separation at the cavity
   trailing edge, while vortical flow is generated by the side insulation
   plates. For the ramped cavity configuration, moderately large pressure
   fluctuations appear on the cavity outside walls in the upstream region
   due to unsteady flow from the upstream edge of the plate. The raised
   pantograph, roof cavity, and ramped cavity are identified as the
   dominant noise sources. When the retracted pantograph is located in the
   ramped roof cavity, its noise contribution is less important.
   Furthermore, the insulation plates also generate tonal components in the
   noise spectra. Of the three configurations considered, the roof cavity
   configuration radiates the least noise at the side receiver in terms of
   A-weighted level.},

Title = {Spreading and bouncing of liquid alkane droplets upon impacting on a
   heated surface},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {159},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper reports an experimental investigation on the impact dynamics
   of liquid normal alkane (nheptane, n-decane and n-tetradecane) droplets
   on a stainless steel surface using high speed photography and long
   distance microscopic techniques. Particular interest is paid to
   comprehensively explore the effects of liquid viscosity and surface
   roughness on droplet spreading and bouncing dynamics at different
   thermal hydrodynamic impact regions. Specifically, firstly, high speed
   images identified four regimes (evaporation, nucleate boiling,
   transition boiling and film boiling regime) of physical phenomena that
   couple the droplet spreading hydrodynamics, heat transfer and phase
   change. Bubbles generation due to the heating of the surface with
   compression of air disk under the droplet was observed and this
   phenomenon is firstly promoted and then inhibited with the increase of
   the wall temperature until finally no bubbles were observed when wall
   temperature is beyond the Leidenfrost point (T-L). Rim disturbances
   during spreading were observed at relatively high Weber number with wall
   temperature higher than T-L. Increasing wall temperature reduces the rim
   disturbance. Secondly, the measured non-dimensional maximum spreading
   diameter beta(max) decreases with the increase of surface temperature
   until it becomes a constant when temperature is beyond T-L. Rough
   surface was found to have a lower T-L because of larger vapor pressure
   provided by more nucleation sites. Finally, for wall temperature beyond
   T-L, droplet bounces up after a certain period of residence time
   (tau(r)). It takes more time for droplet to rebound at larger We because
   of larger beta(max) takes longer time to retract and rebound. Both
   surface roughness and liquid viscosity showed no influence on time to
   reach beta(max) (tau(max)), but significantly increases tau(r) by
   slowing the retracting process, which both should be considered in
   future model of tau(r). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Individuals with mobility impairments often discuss the challenges
   associated with donning and doffing shirts (i.e. putting them on and
   taking them off). Limited previous work has tackled this issue, but the
   comfort and aesthetic integrity of the shirt is often forgotten. In this
   paper, we co-designed an adaptive shirt with individuals with mobility
   impairments and personal support workers. With the insights from these
   discussions, we developed an augmented top that transforms wide sizes
   (for the easy donning and doffing) into their preferred fit. The study
   resulted in the design of SMAller Aid, which uses Shape Memory Alloy
   (SMA) springs to retract to a smaller size. The shirt adapts to their
   needs while retaining its aesthetic integrity to empower them with
   independence and no required assistance.},

Abstract = {Let K be a nonempty closed convex subset of a real reflexive Banach
   space X that has weakly sequentially continuous duality mapping J(phi)

   nonexpansive mappings with F := boolean AND(infinity)(i=0) F-(Ti) not

   convergence of two viscosity approximation schemes to a common fixed
   point (x) over bar = Qf ((x) over bar) of a family of multivalued
   nonexpansive mappings in Banach spaces. Moreover, (x) over bar is the
   unique solution in F to a certain variational inequality. (C) 2011

Abstract = {This paper discusses collar spine arrangements in the genus Echinostoma.
   All arrangements are of uneven numbers of collar spines on the oral
   collar. The total number of collar spines in these arrangements ranges
   from a low 31 to a high 51. There are 11 models of collar spine
   arrangements in the Echinostoma consisting of spine numbers 31, 33, 35,
   37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, and 51. Representative species with these
   collar spine arrangements are given in the article. The number of collar
   spines in a species is identical in both the larval and adult forms.
   Reports of even numbered spine counts in the genus Echinostoma are
   erroneous and probably reflect counts on worms with lost, retracted, or
   supernumerary spines.},

Abstract = {In this paper we explore discrete random variables over domains. We show
   that these lead to a continuous endofunctor on the categories RB
   (domains that axe retracts of bifinite domains), and FS (domains where
   the identity map is the directed supremum of deflations finitely
   separated from the identity). The significance of this result lies in
   the fact that there is no known category of continuous domains that is
   closed under the probabilistic power domain, which forms the standard
   approach to modeling probabilistic choice over domains. The fact that RB
   and FS are cartesian closed and also are closed under the discrete
   random variables power domain means we can now model, e.g., the untyped
   lambda calculus extended with a probabilistic choice operator,
   implemented via random variables.},

Abstract = {On May 22, 2017, administrative law Judge Leslie Rogall of the

   California at Riverside biochemistry professor Frank Sauer with research
   misconduct for fabricating or falsifying digital image data included in
   three papers and seven grant applications submitted to the National
   Institutes of Health. More specifically, Sauer was deemed responsible
   for manipulating, reusing, and falsely labeling images of autoradiograms
   and gels in his research in epigenetics. One month after this decision,
   ORI announced its final ruling concerning Sauer, which barred him from
   serving in any advisory capacity to the Public Health Services and
   required him to retract affected papers. The case raises some
   interesting and important questions concerning research integrity

Title = {Modeling and simulation of viscoelastic film retraction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {249},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the retraction of a circular viscoelastic
   liquid film with a hole initially present in its center by means of
   finite element numerical simulations. We study the whole retraction
   process, aiming at understanding the hole opening dynamics both when the
   hole does not feel any confinement and when it interacts with the solid
   wall bounding the film. The retraction behavior is also interpreted
   through a simple toy model, that highlights the physical mechanism
   underlying the process.
   We consider three different viscoelastic constitutive equations, namely,
   Oldroyd-B, Giesekus (Gsk), and Phan Thien Tanner (PIT) models, and
   several system geometries, in terms of the film initial radius and
   thickness. For each given geometry, we investigate the effects of liquid
   inertia, elasticity, and flow-dependent viscosity on the dynamics of the
   hole opening. Depending on the relative strength of such parameters,
   qualitatively different features can appear in the retracting film shape
   and dynamics.
   When inertia is relevant, as far as the opening hole does not interact
   with the wall bounding the film, the influence of liquid elasticity is
   very moderate, and the retraction dynamics tends to the one of Newtonian
   sheets; when the hole starts to interact with the solid wall, hole
   radius/opening velocity oscillations are detected. Such oscillations are
   enhanced at increasing elasticity. From the morphological point of view,
   the formation of a rim at the edge of the retracting film is observed.
   If inertial forces become less relevant with respect to viscous forces,
   R-oscillations disappear, the hole opening velocity goes through a
   maximum and then monotonically decays to zero, and no rim forms during
   the film retraction. Geometrical changes have the effect of enlarging or
   reducing the portion of the retraction dynamics not influenced by the
   presence of the solid wall with respect to the one governed by the
   hole-wall interactions.},

Abstract = {Frequent use of herbicides may impose a risk on non-target species. The
   objective was to test the combined toxic effect of binary herbicide
   mixtures-metribuzin:halosulfuron and metribuzin:flumioxazin-on
   non-target earthworms in two test systems: filter paper and a soil
   toxicity test system. The joint action experiments were independently
   run twice to substantiate the findings. The most potent individual
   herbicide was metribuzin, with a 50\% lethal concentration (LC50) of
   17.17 mu g ai. cm(-2) at 48 h in the filter paper test. The toxicity of
   the individual herbicides on the filter paper test was ranked as
   metribuzin>halosulfuron>flumioxazin. In the soil test, metribuzin and
   halosulfuron had high toxicity with an LC50 of 8.48 and 10.08 mg ai.
   kg(-1), respectively, on day 14. Thus, the individual herbicide ranking
   did not change between the filter paper and artificial soil tests. The
   herbicide's mixed effect in both test systems showed a consistent
   antagonistic effect relative to a Concentration Addition reference
   model. It indicates that the mixtures retracted the herbicide's action
   in the earthworms.},

Abstract = {Fraisse's theorem characterizing the existence of universal homogeneous
   structures is a cornerstone of model theory. A categorical version of
   these results was developed by Droste and Gobel. Such an abstract
   version of Fra < ss, theory allows to construct unusual objects that are
   far away from the usual structures. In this paper we are going to derive
   sufficient conditions for a comma category to contain universal
   homogeneous objects. Using this criterion, we characterize homogeneous
   structures that possess universal homogeneous endomorphisms. The
   existence of such endomorphisms helps to reduce questions about the full
   endomorphism monoid to the self-embedding monoid of the structure. As
   another application we characterize the retracts of homogeneous
   structures that are induced by universal homogeneous retractions. This
   extends previous results by Bonato, DeliAc, Mudrinski, Dolinka, and

   in a very natural way, a Conley-type (integer valued) index for K. This
   index is computed and it is shown that it only depends on what is called
   the attracting part of K. The index is used to obtain a characterization
   of isolating neighbourhoods of compact invariant sets with non-empty
   attracting part. This index also provides a characterization of compact

Abstract = {We study the homotopy properties of set-valued maps from a class
   containing, for example, the finite compositions of acyclic upper
   semi-continuous maps of finite-dimensional absolute neighbourhood
   retracts. We prove some generalizations of the classical Hopf theorems
   concerning homotopy classification and the extension of set-valued maps.
   We show that under some mild conditions on spaces, each map from the
   considered class is homotopic within this class to a single-valued map.
   Therefore the results of the paper yield answers to some old questions
   of the theory of set-valued maps. The main results rely on the proved
   theorem stating that a perfect surjection with acyclic fibres induces a
   bijective (co)transformation of the sets of homotopy classes and
   constituting an extension of the famous Vietoris theorem.},

Abstract = {Nonmonotonic reasoning is a logical inference system which attempts to
   approximate human commonsense reasoning and is characterized as
   defeasible: having reasonably drawn a conclusion from some premises we
   may be forced to retract that conclusion upon learning new facts. This
   paper introduces a Petri net model for nonmonotonic reasoning with
   nonmonotonic rules generated by annotated logic programs and the unless
   operator. In the Petri net model, a fixpoint of a nonmonotonic theory
   can be represented as a maximal and consistent support of a firing
   sequence. We propose a structural method for finding extensions
   (coherent consequences) for a given set of nonmonotonic logic rules. It
   is based on the T-invariant technique for testing fireability of a goal
   transition in the Petri net model of Horn clause logic programs.},

Abstract = {We describe the ongoing citations to biomedical articles affected by
   scientific misconduct, and characterize the papers that cite these
   affected articles. The citations to 102 articles named in official
   findings of scientific misconduct during the period of 1993 and 2001
   were identified through the Institute for Scientific Information Web of
   Science database. Using a stratified random sampling strategy, we
   performed a content analysis of 603 of the 5,393 citing papers to
   identify indications of awareness that the cited articles affected by
   scientific misconduct had validity issues, and to examine how the citing
   papers referred to the affected articles. Fewer than 5\% of citing
   papers indicated any awareness that the cited article was retracted or
   named in a finding of misconduct. We also tested the hypothesis that
   affected articles would have fewer citations than a comparison sample;
   this was not supported. Most articles affected by misconduct were
   published in basic science journals, and we found little cause for
   concern that such articles may have affected clinical equipoise or
   clinical care.},

Abstract = {HDD heads have various interaction mechanisms with thermal asperities
   (TAs), and protection mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure the
   head-disk interaction (HDI) resulting from them is eliminated or
   minimized to the highest extent possible. It is straightforward to not
   allow the head sit-on-track on cylinders that have such TAs on them, and
   the same principle can be extended to so-called high TAs (HTAs), whose
   height is more than the fly height of the head, so heads do not
   inadvertently interact with the TA even when motion is triggered on
   another head, since the entire head stack moves together.
   Similar TA interactions also occur when the head seeks across the
   tracks. Typical short seeks have thermal fly-height control (TFC) turned
   on while it is turned on during long seeks, which is greater than a few
   hundred tracks. Heads can also interact with TAs during retract and
   arrival of the head during such long seeks. Finally, background media
   scan (BGMS), which is an industry standard, when the drive enters an
   idle state. Interaction with HTAs can also occur when the drive enters
   such a state.
   Typical seek avoidance attempts to eliminate TA interaction during
   seeking, however it is not straightforward to determine which of the
   seek mechanism: TFC On during short seeks, retract/arrival during long
   seeks, HTA interaction during long seeks with TFC off, or idle TA
   interaction causes the greatest HDI. Through theoretical analysis and
   experimental corroboration, this paper intends to rank the various modes
   of TA interaction, so by developing features for eliminating or
   minimizing them in that order could help bring the maximum benefit for
   achieving minimum lifetime reduction of the head due to such
   interaction.},

Abstract = {We describe a method for updating the classification of ontologies
   expressed in the EL family of Description Logics after some axioms have
   been added or deleted. While incremental classification modulo additions
   is relatively straightforward, handling deletions is more problematic
   since it requires retracting logical consequences that are no longer
   valid. Known algorithms address this problem using various forms of
   bookkeeping to trace the consequences back to premises. But such
   additional data can consume memory and place an extra burden on the
   reasoner during application of inferences. In this paper, we present a
   technique, which avoids this extra cost while being very efficient for
   small incremental changes in ontologies. The technique is freely
   available as a part of the open-source EL reasoner ELK and its
   efficiency is demonstrated on naturally occurring and synthetic data.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that some traditional fallacies should be considered
   as reasonable arguments when used as part of a properly conducted
   dialog. It is shown that argumentation schemes, formal dialog models,
   and profiles of dialog are useful tools for studying properties of
   defeasible reasoning and fallacies. It is explained how defeasible
   reasoning of the most common sort can deteriorate into fallacious
   argumentation in some instances. Conditions are formulated that can be
   used as normative tools to judge whether a given defeasible argument is
   fallacious or not. It is shown that three leading violations of proper
   dialog standards for defeasible reasoning necessary to see how fallacies
   work are: (a) improper failure to retract a commitment, (b) failure of
   openness to defeat, and (c) illicit reversal of burden of proof.},

Abstract = {Headspace solvent microextraction (HSM) is a novel method of sample
   preparation for chromatographic analysis. It involves exposing a
   microdrop of high-boiling point organic solvent extruded from the needle
   tip of a gas chromatographic syringe to the headspace above a sample.
   Volatile organic compounds are extracted and concentrated in the
   microdrop. Next, the microdrop is retracted into the microsyringe and
   injected directly into the chromatograph. HSM has a number of
   advantages, including renewable drop (no sample carryover), low cost,
   simplicity and ease of use, short time of analysis, high sensitivity and
   low detection limits, good precision, minimal solvent use, and no need
   for instrument modification. This paper presents analytical
   characteristics of HSM as applied to the determination of benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes in water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Title = {Defying gravity: Drops that climb up a vertical wall of their own accord},

Abstract = {Drops that move uphill on a gradient surface have been introduced in the
   past. In this paper, however, we present drops that climb a surface that
   does not have a gradient to begin with. In our study, Octadecylamine in
   Tetradecane (ODA/TD) drops were placed on either vertical or horizontal
   mica surfaces, and both the cases show spreading and retraction that
   initiate the motion of the ODA/TD drops. On horizontal surfaces,
   initially, the drop spreads in all directions. Then, after some time,
   which is a function of the solute concentration, the rear edge of the
   drop jerks in the direction opposite to spreading with a retraction that
   reminds breaststroke swimming motion: the front sides keep spreading
   while the back retracts, followed by the sides closing on themselves and
   pushing all the liquid forward which is the only place that never
   retracts. The front side of the drop then spreads faster in a way that
   reminds the circle that the arms make during breaststroke. The back and
   front sides of the drop continue to shrink and expand, respectively,
   with a net result of moving forward. The reason this motion can happen,
   is that the drop self-creates a local interfacial gradient at its
   surrounding. The direction of this self-induced interfacial gradient is
   against the gravity for inclined surfaces and is random if the surface
   is horizontal. Tilting the surface results in a local gradient that is
   preferentially opposite to the direction of gravity, hence the drop's
   motion results in climbing up. The drop leaves behind it a surfactant
   covered, but otherwise dry, surface. To the best of our knowledge such a
   system has not been explored before. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

   solution originated from three moving planar traveling fronts, and
   evolved to a V-shaped traveling front as time changes, which means that
   the profile of this solution is not invariant at all. Here an entire
   solution is referred to a solution that is defined for all time t is an
   element of R and in the whole space x is an element of R-N. Furthermore,
   we show that not only the entire solution but also all transition fronts
   share the same global mean speed by constructing suitable radially

   a method which unifies the hybrid method introduced by Solodov and
   Svaiter {[}24] and the shrinking projection method introduced by
   Takahashi, Takeuchi and Kubota {[}29] and then prove a strong
   convergence result by this method for finding a common fixed point of
   the family of new generalized nonexpansive mappings in a Banach space.
   Using this result, we prove two strong convergence theorems by the
   hybrid method and the shrinking projection method. Using these two
   results, we obtain well-known and new strong convergence theorems in a
   Hilbert space and a Banach space.},

Abstract = {In a recent paper we have introduced a notion of continuity in digital
   spaces which extends the usual notion of digital continuity. Our
   approach, which uses multivalued maps, provides a better framework to
   define topological notions, like retractions, in a far more realistic
   way than by using just single-valued digitally continuous functions. In
   particular, we characterized the deletion of simple points, one of the
   most important processing operations in digital topology, as a
   particular kind of retraction.
   In this work we give a simpler algorithm to define the retraction
   associated to the deletion of a simple point and we use this algorithm
   to characterize some well known parallel thinning algorithm as a
   particular kind of multivalued retraction, with the property that each
   point is retracted to its neighbors.},

Abstract = {Starting with the notion of modelling biologically inspired agents, this
   paper focuses on their spatial characteristics. It will be demonstrated
   that one of the most prominent formalisms in modelling the behaviour of
   biological colonies, X-machines, cannot provide a neat and effective way
   to modelling spatial agents (i.e. agents distributed and move through a
   physical space). We introduce a X-machines variation that besides
   facilitating formal modelling.. will provide grounds towards visual
   animation of these systems. This approach resulted into a novel
   progression, Spatial X-machines, without retracting the legacy
   characteristics X-machines such as testing and verification strategies.
   Unlike other formalisms that go behind the concept of treating the
   agent's behaviour as one uniform component, Spatial X-machines tend to
   draw a separation between different types of agent's behaviour.},

   The experimental method used is based on a highspeed cinematography
   technique combined with advanced image processing means. The
   observations are made at ambient pressure, ambient temperature, with an
   initial droplet diameter of 2 mm.
   The measurements are performed on a large range of variation of relevant
   dimensionless parameters in order to determine different thresholds. We
   show that whatever the operating conditions, the drop spreads and
   retracts under the action of inertia and capillarity respectively. In
   the initial stages of impact, the transient evolution of wetted area and
   spreading rate for a given impact Weber number, appear to be independent
   of the surface on which the droplet impinges. These results are
   discussed within the framework of possible physical mechanisms.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the dynamic model of the high-power pretensioner used for
   the seat belt of a passenger vehicle is developed. The operating device
   of the pretensioner is optimised to improve the length of the web
   retraction. The three-dimensional rigid dynamic model of the
   pretensioner is created using the commercial multi-body programme,
   ADAMS, and the nonlinear spring element is used to represent the seat
   belt. The reliability of the dynamic model is validated by comparing the
   simulation results with the actual test results. The pretensioner
   presented in this paper is operated by the rack and pinion gear
   mechanism. The profile of the rack and pinion is optimised to improve
   the retracting performance of the pretensioner using the design of
   experiments. The optimised rack and pinion gear is applied to the
   dynamic model, and the optimisation results are verified by comparing
   the simulation results of the original and the optimised model.},

Journal = {TEXT \& TALK},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {This paper examines instances of swearing in live television broadcasts.
   While some cable television shows routinely involve swearing without
   censorship and recorded shows may include swearing ``bleeped out,{''}
   our interest is in instances of swearing in contexts where swearing is
   prohibited. We look at live interviews and panel debates where swearing
   is clearly noticed and reacted to strongly-and in all cases retracted or
   apologized for in some way. The examples we examine thus involve a
   participant visibly moving outside the normative limits of the
   interaction, and as such reveal the boundaries that serve as
   organizational structures for the interactions. Drawing on Goffman's
   work on gaffes and slips and ethnomethodological conversation analysis,
   the paper explores how swearing is treated by the participants as a
   practical concern, and how swearing and its management implicates the
   identities and relationships of the participants and the specific
   context of the interaction. We discuss how swearing in live broadcasts
   reveals the limits of authenticity within informal, conversational
   interviews and debates.},

Title = {Design of an ultra-thin steerable probe for percutaneous interventions
   and preliminary evaluation in a gelatine phantom},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 4},
Abstract = {Needles with diameter under 1 mm are used in various medical
   applications to limit the risk of complication and patient discomfort
   during the procedure. Next to a small diameter, needle steerability is
   an important property for reaching targets located deep inside the body
   accurately and precisely. In this paper, we present a 0.5-mm prototype
   probe which is able to steer in three dimensions (3D) without the need
   of axial rotation. The prototype consists of three Nitinol wires (each
   with a diameter of 0.125 mm) with a pre-curved tip. The wires are kept
   together by a stainless steel tube. Each wire is clamped to a block
   which translates along a leadscrew, the rotation of the latter being
   controlled by a wheel connected at the distal end of the leadscrew. The
   tip bends upon retraction of one or two wires. When pushed through a
   soft solid structure (e.g., a soft tissue or soft tissue phantom), the
   probe deflects due to off-axis forces acting on its tip by the
   surrounding structure. We tested the performance of the prototype into a
   10\% wt gelatine phantom, in terms of the predictability of the steering
   direction and the controllability of the final position after steering
   inside the substrate. The results showed that the probe steered in the
   direction of the retracted wire and that the final position varied from
   small deflections from the straight path when the wires were slightly
   retracted, to sharp curvatures for large wire retraction. The probe
   could be used in various applications, from cases where only a small
   correction of the path in one direction is needed to cases where the
   path to be followed includes obstacles and curves in multiple
   directions.},

Title = {Evolution of Neck Vertebral Shape and Neck Retraction at the Transition
   to Modern Turtles: an Integrated Geometric Morphometric Approach},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-204},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The unique ability of modern turtles to retract their head and neck into
   the shell through a side-necked (pleurodiran) or hidden-necked
   (cryptodiran) motion is thought to have evolved independently in crown
   turtles. The anatomical changes that led to the vertebral shapes of
   modern turtles, however, are still poorly understood. Here we present
   comprehensive geometric morphometric analyses that trace turtle
   vertebral evolution and reconstruct disparity across phylogeny.
   Disparity of vertebral shape was high at the dawn of turtle evolution
   and decreased after the modern groups evolved, reflecting a
   stabilization of morphotypes that correspond to the two retraction
   modes. Stem turtles, which had a very simple mode of retraction, the
   lateral head tuck, show increasing flexibility of the neck through
   evolution towards a pleurodiran-like morphotype. The latter was the
   precondition for evolving pleurodiran and cryptodiran vertebrae. There
   is no correlation between the construction of formed articulations in
   the cervical centra and neck mobility. An increasing mobility between
   vertebrae, associated with changes in vertebral shape, resulted in a
   more advanced ability to retract the neck. In this regard, we
   hypothesize that the lateral tucking retraction of stem turtles was not
   only the precondition for pleurodiran but also of cryptodiran
   retraction. For the former, a kink in the middle third of the neck
   needed to be acquired, whereas for the latter modification was necessary
   between the eighth cervical vertebra and first thoracic vertebra. Our
   paper highlights the utility of 3D shape data, analyzed in a
   phylogenetic framework, to examine the magnitude and mode of
   evolutionary modifications to vertebral morphology. By reconstructing
   and visualizing ancestral anatomical shapes, we provide insight into the
   anatomical features underlying neck retraction mode, which is a salient
   component of extant turtle classification.},

Abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated an ongoing change across varieties of
   English in which /s/ retracts before consonants, particularly before
   /tI/ clusters (e.g., Lawrence, 2000; Shapiro, 1995; Stuart-Smith et al.,
   2019). Much of this work has focused on the social and linguistic
   distributions of /stL/ within single communities, without an examination
   of the broader sibilant space (e.g., /s/ and /integral/). Meanwhile,
   analyses across multiple corpora have shown that /s/ and /integral/=
   also show within-community variability, beyond /stL/ contexts
   (Stuart-Smith et al., 2019, 2020). Intersecting these approaches, this
   paper explores sibilant variation and change across /stL/ /s/, and
   /integral/= using a corpus of Washington D.C. African American Language
   (AAL). Results indicate that /stI/-retraction is a stable variant in
   this variety of AAL and /s/ and /integral/ show evidence of socially
   stratified variation and change. Overall, this paper demonstrates the
   need to examine the sibilant space more holistically when examining
   changes in /stJ/.},

Abstract = {Normal kinematic joint can be transformed to variable kinematic
   joint(VKJ), which refers to a kinematic joint that is capable of
   topological variation in a mechanism, by utilizing effect of friction
   and self-locking. In this paper a metamorphic mechanism cell which can
   realize deploying, self-locking, unlocking, retracting and interlocking
   with other cells, is designed by incorporating VKJs. Self-locking margin
   is proposed to estimate the selflocking capability. The variable
   topology configurations of this cell are presented and the mobility of
   this cell is analyzed. With the new metamorphic cell, a cable-driven
   telescopic model with 3 tubes is built, and its motion simulations are
   conducted to verify the design method. The results demonstrate that the
   impact in transformation is mitigated and multistage orderly
   deployable/retractable mechanisms can be built by this method. (C)

   as no surprise that ethics did not escape Dr Brumback's consideration.
   Reading Dr Brumback's vitae, I came across several publications that
   afford insights into topics that tugged at his moral fabric. Dr Brumback
   was a steadfast defender of the scientific method. Reading his
   commentaries, one gets the sense that Dr Brumback felt personally
   attacked when quackery challenged science. In addition, and as long-time
   Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child Neurology, Dr Brumback
   considered it a personal affront every time a paper he published, or for
   that matter published by any scientific journal, had to be retracted or

Abstract = {The work presented in this paper focuses on the description and
   evaluation of an augmented reality nanomanipulator, called ``nanoLearner
   platform{''} used as educational tool in practical works of nanophysics.
   Through virtual reality associated to multisensory renderings, students
   are immersed in the nanoworld where they can interact in real time with
   a sample surface or an object, using their senses as hearing, seeing and
   touching. The role of each sensorial rendering in the understanding and
   control of the ``approach-retract{''} interaction has been determined
   thanks to statistical studies obtained during practicals. Conjointly,
   qualitative analyses of student reports revealed the NanoLearner
   platform efficiency, compared to the use of classical tools. Finally, we
   present extension of the use of this innovative tool for investigating
   nano effects in living organisms and for allowing grand public to have
   access to a natural understanding of nanophenomena.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we study whether voters are more likely to ``vote out{''}
   a corrupt incumbent than to re-elect him. Specifically, we examine
   whether they retract their support from political candidates who they
   think are corrupt by looking at changes in an index of corruption
   perceptions between the current and the last elections. Our results
   suggest that corruption in public office is effectively punished by
   voters. Furthermore, our findings support the idea that both the
   political system and the democratic experience are important
   determinants of the voters' reaction and control of corruption; while
   voters in countries with parliamentary systems or with relatively low
   levels of democracy react negatively to an increase in corruption, no
   perceptible effect of this kind was found in countries with mature
   democracies, and the evidence is inconclusive in the case of countries
   with presidential systems.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the control of an autonomous underwater vehicle
   (AUV) with a deployable energy-harvesting kite for oceanographic
   observation and surveillance. The proposed design and control strategies
   specifically address objectives of achieving high-payload,
   long-endurance AUV operation through the deployment of an
   energy-harvesting kite while the AUV is anchored to the seabed, followed
   by the retraction of the kite for continued operation of the AUV. While
   deployed, the kite executes power-augmenting cross-current flight
   motions, using a hierarchical controller. When the AUV is in motion and
   the kite is retracted, a dynamic programming-based controller is used to
   select charging locations that minimize total charging time when
   traversing a prescribed mission path. Focusing on oceanographic
   observation along a Gulf Stream transect, using a hindcast model of the
   Gulf Stream current resource, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of the
   proposed control approach, as compared to several non-optimized
   alternatives.},

Abstract = {For a pomonoid S, let us denote Pos-S the category of S-posets and
   S-poset maps. In this paper, we consider the slice category Pos-S/B for
   an S-poset B, and study some categorical ingredients. We first show that
   there is no non-trivial injective object in Pos-S/B. Then we investigate
   injective objects with respect to the class of regular monomorphisms in
   this category and show that Pos-S/B has enough regular injective
   objects. We also prove that regular injective objects are retracts of
   exponentiable objects in this category. One of the main aims of the
   paper is to draw attention to characterizing injectivity in the category
   Pos-S/B under a particular case where B has trivial action. Among other
   things, we also prove that the necessary condition for a map (an object)
   here to be regular injective is being convex and present an example to
   show that the converse is not true, in general.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a silicone retractor, which is a continuation and
   extension of a previously developed system that had the same three
   functions as the old version: 1) retracting, 2) suction, and 3) force
   sensing. These features make the retractor a safe choice for use in
   neurosurgery. Suction is achieved by attaching the retractor to a
   suction pipe. The retractor has a deformation area filled with an
   incompressible liquid that is displaced in proportion to the extent of
   deformation; fiberscopes or human eyes detecting the displacement get a
   visual representation of the force. The new design improves on the old
   one in three ways-miniaturization, made possible by the
   incompressible-liquid-based mechanism, and measurement of force
   distribution by distribution of the areas deformed by force. The system
   was validated by conducting experiments.},

Abstract = {Most of the development of shape theory was in the so-called outer shape

   This paper belongs to the so-called inner shape theory, in which the
   shape of spaces is described intrinsically without the use of any
   outside gadgets. We give a description of shape theory that does not
   need absolute neighbourhood retracts. We prove that the category HN
   whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are proximate
   homotopy classes of proximate nets is naturally equivalent to the shape
   category Lh. The description of the category HN for compact metric
   spaces was given earlier by Jose M. R. Sanjurjo. We also give three
   applications of this new approach to shape theory.},

Abstract = {In this paper we compute the generating function of modular,

   does not contain any isolated arcs and any arc has length at least four.
   Modular diagrams represent the deformation retracts of RNA tertiary
   structures and their properties reflect basic features of these
   bio-molecules. The particular case of modular noncrossing diagrams has
   been extensively studied. Let Q(k)(n) denote the number of modular
   k-noncrossing diagrams over n vertices. We derive exact enumeration
   results as well as the asymptotic formula Qk(n) similar to
   c(k)n(-(k-1)2-k-1/2) gamma(-n)(k) for k = 3, ... , 9 and derive a new
   proof of the formula Q(2)(n) similar to 1.4848 n(-3/2) 1.8489(n)

Abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive control scheme for a hyper-redundant
   robot articulated nimble adaptable trunk (ANAT) subject to spatial
   constraints. An optimization scheme is applied to avoid obstacles in 3D
   space present in the robot's trajectory by using redundancy, and to
   prevent the robot from retracting and crashing into the base by setting
   a security envelop. The generation of the trajectory with obstacles
   avoidance is performed by calculating the differential inverse
   kinematics of the robot based on the generalized inverse function. The
   obstacles are modeled by hyper-surfaces in order to reduce calculations
   and improve the computation time. When the optimal trajectory is
   attained in presence of the imposed constraints, an adaptive control law
   is applied to the robot. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of
   the proposed approach. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Recent observations of intense, impulsive gamma-ray- and X-ray-emitting
   solar flares underline the suddenness of these events.  The simultaneous
   emission of X-rays > 40 keV from electron bremsstrahlung and gamma-rays
   requiring several MeV protons shows that all particles must be
   accelerated in less than 5 s.  This paper proposes a simple model to
   explain such events, using the energy stored in the stretched field
   lines of a coronal arch.  When reconnection occurs at the top of the
   arch, field lines retract like stretched rubber bands, sweeping up
   plasma and acting like a piston or slingshot.  When the slug of plasma
   caught in the magnetic fields strikes the photosphere, it deposits its
   considerable kinetic energy, heating and compressing the intruding slug.
   Ten slugs of 100 km radius striking the photosphere may account for the
   10(29) ergs radiation from loop flares.},

Abstract = {Attack-Support Argumentation Framework (ASAF) is an extension of the
   Bipolar Argumentation Framework that allows for attacks and supports not
   only between arguments but also targeting attacks and supports at any
   level. In this paper we propose an incremental approach for computing
   the skeptical preferred acceptance in dynamic ASAFs. Specifically, we
   investigate how the skeptical acceptance of a goal element (an argument,
   an attack, or a support) evolves when a given ASAF is updated by adding
   or retracting an argument, an attack, or a support, and propose an
   incremental algorithm for solving this problem. Our approach relies on
   identifying a portion of the given ASAF which is sufficient to determine
   the status of the goal w.r.t. the updated ASAF. We experimentally
   evaluate our approach showing that it outperforms the computation from
   scratch on average.},

Abstract = {The 2-primary Hopf invariant 1 elements in the stable homotopy groups of
   spheres form the most accessible family of elements. In this paper, we
   explore some properties of the epsilon(infinity) ring spectra obtained
   from certain iterated mapping cones by applying the free algebra
   functor. In fact, these are equivalent to Thom spectra over infinite
   loop spaces related to the classifying spaces BSO, BSpin, BString. We
   show that the homology of these Thom spectra are all extended comodule
   algebras of the form A({*})square(A(r){*}) P-{*} over the dual Steenrod
   algebra A({*}) with A({*})square(A(r){*}) F-2 as an algebra retract.
   This suggests that these spectra might be wedges of module spectra over
   the ring spectra HZ, kO or tmf; however, apart from the first case, we
   have no concrete results on this.},

Abstract = {We present a bibliometric analysis of a large corpus of research work by
   H. J. Eysenck (1916-1997), who was one of the most famous and productive
   psychologists of the 20th century. It utilizes new bibliometric tools to
   update an analysis of Rushton (2001), examining how articles cluster in
   terms of themes and co-authors. We present our analysis in the light of
   a recent investigation by King's College London, which concluded that a
   number of Eysenck's papers are `unsafe' and they recommended that
   journal editors should consider their retraction. We enquire about the
   relationship between these personality and fatal disease papers and the
   wider body of Eysenck's work. Our analysis revealed that these papers
   are part of a research topic that stands apart from his many other
   seminal contributions to psychological knowledge; and, even if they were
   all retracted, this would have little impact on the main corpus of his
   work. Our analysis and presentation shines a new light on the
   contribution of Britain's most productive, but sometimes controversial,
   psychologist.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a new approach is presented for modeling and control of
   an automated polishing/deburring process that utilizes a dual-purpose
   compliant toolhead. This toolhead has a pneumatic spindle that can be
   extended and retracted by three pneumatic actuators to provide tool
   compliance. By integrating a pressure sensor and a linear encoder, this
   toolhead can be used for polishing and deburring. For the polishing
   control, the tool pressure is pre-planned based on the given part
   geometry, and a PID controller is applied for pressure tracking though
   pressure sensing. For the deburring control, another PID controller is
   applied to regulate the tool length through tool extension sensing. The
   two control methods have been tested and implemented on a
   polishing/deburring robot, and the experiment results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the presented methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Some Factors Influencing Calling Behavior and Mass Emission Rate of Sex
   Pheromone from the Gland of the Moth Chloridea virescens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To attract a mate, females of most moth species synthesize and emit sex
   pheromone from a specific gland in a behavior termed ``calling{''}. In a
   broad temporal sense, calling behavior and pheromone synthesis are
   synchronized through the overlap of their circadian rhythms. However,
   the limited amount of pheromone a female produces each day must be
   managed so that pheromone is emitted at a sufficient (to attract males)
   mass emission rate (MER) over the entire calling period, typically many
   hours. We are studying pheromone synthesis and emission in the moth
   Chloridea (formerly Heliothis) virescens (family Noctuidae). One way
   that female C. virescens manage pheromone over their calling period is
   by calling intermittently; the period between calling bouts allows
   females to replenish pheromone, and resume calling at high MERs.
   However, militating against replenishment is loss of pheromone through
   putative catabolism. In this paper, we examined three aspects pertaining
   to pheromone MER in C. virescens: (i) the effect of adult feeding on
   calling behavior, (ii) the effect of certain behavioral/physical
   parameters on MER, and (iii) the relative loss (putative catabolism) of
   pheromone in retracted (non-calling) and everted (calling) glands. We
   found that (i) adult feeding increases calling duration, consistent with
   the known concomitant increase in pheromone production, (ii) various
   physical factors relating to the gland, including degree of eversion
   (surface area), orientation to airstream, and air velocity over the
   gland influence MER, and (iii) putative catabolism occurs in both
   retracted and everted glands, but substantially less pheromone is lost
   in the everted gland primarily because of the high MER when the gland is
   first everted. Together, these data demonstrate that, over the calling
   period, the efficient use of pheromone for emission by female C.
   virescens is dependent on the interaction among synthesis, storage,
   catabolism, and calling behavior.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a new Hamiltonian nodal position finite element
   method for dynamic analysis of spatial flexible cable systems with large
   deformation. The dynamic governing equation is derived from finite
   elasticity theory. Logarithmic strain is applied to construct large
   deformation Hamiltonian canonical equations. An efficient second-order
   symplectic difference algorithm is built to solve the canonical
   equations numerically. A large strain conical pendulum system is
   analyzed numerically by the proposed method, and the numerical results
   are compared with those retracted from the existing Hamiltonian methods
   and Livermore Software Technology Corporation: dynamics (LS-DYNA). The
   proposed method is further verified by two tethered dynamic experiments
   involving large displacement motion and large deformation. The
   comparisons and verifications demonstrate that the proposed method is of
   symplectic conservation, has high accuracy and has stability for
   calculating flexible cable system dynamics with large deformation.},

Abstract = {this paper presents a design for a tissue-sampling capsule robot, which
   consists of a small-scale gripper mechanism for performing tissue cuts,
   a novel assembly of three cone-shaped gripper structures that can hold
   the required amount of tissue sample. It implements a new method of
   linear ballscrew actuator to provide folding and unfolding motions of
   the gripper. Successful sets of experiments conducted on the gripper
   system have shown the new ballscrew mechanism was efficient to provide
   rotary-to-linear motion conversion and actuate the gripper. The gripper
   has successfully retracted 3 mm(3) of gel, similar to soft tissue, at
   3.1 mm/s and a force of 1350 mN. These results can lead to further
   investigations in the design of advanced systems for in-vivo medical
   devices, minimally invasive surgery, and, specifically, for capsule
   robots.},

Abstract = {The applicability of term rewriting to program transformation is limited
   by the lack of control over rule application and by the context-free
   nature of rewrite rules. The first problem is addressed by languages
   supporting user-definable rewriting strategies. The second problem is
   addressed by the extension of rewriting strategies with scoped dynamic
   rewrite rules. Dynamic rules are defined at run-time and can access
   variables available from their definition context. Rules defined within
   a rule :,cope are automatically retracted at the end of that scope. In
   this paper, we explore the design space of dynamic rules, and their
   application to transformation problems. The technique is formally
   defined by extending the operational semantics underlying the program
   transformation language Stratego, and illustrated by means of several
   program transformations in Stratego, including constant propagation,
   bound variable renaming, dead code elimination, function inlining, and
   function specialization.},

Abstract = {In this paper a versatile and adaptive in-pipe robot is designed and
   tested. The existing problem of versatility and adaptability of in pipe
   inspection robots are addressed in this study. The robot is equipped
   with a screw type assembly, which uniformly contracts and retracts a
   tri-arm assembly of wheels connected to it. This mechanism ensures that
   the robot grips the pipe walls when the arms are expanded. The dynamic
   model of the robot is derived and implemented in a proportional integral
   controller. The robot can maintain vertical position by maintaining the
   force exerted on the screw system. Simulations and experiments were
   conducted to determine the robustness and stability of the robot system.
   In addition, the robot is also capable of rust mapping, which enables
   easier pipe monitoring. The rust mapping yielded an 83.2\% success rate.},

Title = {An easy-to-implement filter for separating photo-excited signals from
   topography in scanning tunneling microscopy},
Journal = {REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS},
Year = {2013},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In order to achieve elemental and chemical sensitivity in scanning
   tunneling microscopy (STM), synchrotron x-rays have been applied to
   excite core-level electrons during tunneling. The x-ray
   photo-excitations result in tip currents that are superimposed onto
   conventional tunneling currents. While carrying important physical
   information, the varying x-ray induced currents can destabilize the
   feedback loop causing it to be unable to maintain a constant tunneling
   current, sometimes even causing the tip to retract fully or crash. In
   this paper, we report on an easy-to-implement filter circuit that can
   separate the x-ray induced currents from conventional tunneling
   currents, thereby allowing simultaneous measurements of topography and
   chemical contrasts. The filter and the schematic presented here can also
   be applied to other variants of light-assisted STM such as laser STM.

   Dorroh extension, the Nagata extension, the Jordan extension, and some

   is a weakly 2-primal alpha-compatible ring with an isomorphism alpha of
   R, then R{[}x; alpha] is NJ; if R is a weakly 2-primal delta-compatible
   ring with a derivation delta of R, then R{[}x; delta] is NJ. Moreover,
   we consider some topological conditions for NJ rings and show for a NJ
   ring R that R is J-pm if and only if J- Spec(R) is a normal space if and
   only if Max(R) is a retract of J- Spec(R).},

   Molecular and Cellular Biology Experience},
Journal = {MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We analyzed 960 papers published in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB)
   from 2009 to 2016 and found 59 (6.1\%) to contain inappropriately
   duplicated images. The 59 instances of inappropriate image duplication
   led to 41 corrections, 5 retractions, and 13 instances in which no
   action was taken. Our experience suggests that the majority of
   inappropriate image duplications result from errors during figure
   preparation that can be remedied by correction. Nevertheless, similar to
   10\% of papers with inappropriate image duplications in MCB were
   retracted (similar to 0.5\% of total). If this pro- portion is
   representative, then as many as 35,000 papers in the literature are
   candi-dates for retraction due to inappropriate image duplication. The
   resolution of inappropriate image duplication concerns after publication
   required an average of 6 h of journal staff time per published paper.
   MCB instituted a pilot program to screen images of accepted papers prior
   to publication that identified 12 manuscripts (14.5\% out of 83) with
   image concerns in 2 months. The screening and correction of papers
   before publication required an average of 30 min of staff time per
   problematic paper. Image screening can identify papers with problematic
   images prior to publication, reduces postpublication problems, and
   requires less staff time than the correction of problems after
   publication.},

Abstract = {Considerable attention has been given to the psychology of confession
   evidence in recent years. While various factors have been used to define
   the types of confessions possible, most classification frameworks have
   focused on the various types of false confessions. An expanded framework
   is outlined using a decision-tree model in which confessions are defined
   according to a number of dimensions, including whether or not a
   confession is retracted, veracity or truthfulness, legal culpability of
   the suspect, voluntariness, and specific nature of the coercion that
   might produce a confession. A proposal is made for a new subtype of
   false confession, the coerced-reactive type, to supplement current
   theoretical approaches. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of
   the implications of this conceptual model for providing consultation and
   expert testimony in cases involving disputed confessions. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {A polygon-scaling mechanism is a single DOF (degree-of freedom)
   mechanism for scaling a polygon. This paper presents a tetragon-elements
   based synthesis method of polygon:scaling mechanisms. According to
   movable conditions of radial scaling elements, four basic tetragon
   elements (rhombus element, parallelogram element, kite element and
   general tetragon element) are proposed. For a given polygon, these four
   types of elements can be selected based on the characteristics of target
   polygons to construct polygon-scaling mechanisms in a straightforward
   manner. Using this synthesis method, some planar 1-DOF scaling
   mechanisms are obtained with the characteristics of retracting and
   deploying. Their 3D models are also presented to proof the validity of
   the proposed method. Finally, a table of tetragon elements with the
   characteristics of their associated polygon-scaling mechanisms is
   summarized using which polygon-scaling mechanisms can be easily
   constructed.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel interactive motion planning system for
   assembly/disassembly operations. Our system consists of three layers:
   interaction layer, learning layer and motion library layer In
   interaction layer user's manipulation in difficult scenario is liberated
   by relaxing collision constraints. The resulting path is retracted and
   connected by random retraction method and BiRRT algorithm. A motion path
   which successfully passed through the narrow passage or information of
   geometrical interference in failed case is returned to user In learning
   layer, motion primitives corresponding to prior similar scenario are
   selected by scenario comparison which is based on medial axis, and then
   transformed to generate new motions. Significant improvement for motion
   planning of non-convex object in challenging scenarios with narrow
   passages is obtained by interactive process. The introduction of
   learning mechanism can reduce global planning time and obtain
   experiential knowledge.},

Abstract = {The azygos arch is usually divided during esophagectomy. To achieve
   thorough lymphadenectomy up to upper mediastinum, many surgeons prefer
   to retract the distal stump of the azygos arch by pulling out the thread
   which ligates the stump to the skin through the dorsal side of the
   intercostal space. However, the access to the dorsal chest wall near
   vertebrae for percutaneous puncture is difficult during robot-assisted
   minimally invasive esophagectomy in the prone position. This paper
   reports a new simple method of azygos arch division and retraction using
   a polymer locking ligation system Hem-o-lok (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC,
   USA) and a barbed suture device. This technique can be easily performed
   completely as a robotic procedure without extra puncture, and it is also
   applicable for conventional thoracoscopic procedures with the potential
   benefits of less trauma and bleeding.},

Abstract = {One of the main machining operations to create or widen the holes for
   bolts or screws to fasten the mechanical parts together is drilling
   operation. Peck drilling is a very similar machining operation to
   conventional drilling in which drilling is performed in an interrupted
   fashion to prevent chip accumulation in front of the tool particularly
   when creating deep holes. Peck drilling includes repeatedly plunging and
   retracting the tool to finish the hole. Peck drilling demonstrates its
   superior performance by delivering extended tool life, higher surface
   quality and higher removal rate in comparison to drilling. In this
   paper, an analysis of exergy flow for the two drilling methods is
   presented and the effects of various cutting parameters are analysed.
   Comparison of exergy efficiencies for the two techniques proves that
   peck drilling is more successful in achieving the objectives of
   sustainable manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) often needs to construct an
   underground power transmission tunnel under a heavy-traffic arterial
   road. To reduce cost and on-street construction work by eliminating the
   need for shafts for tunnel connection, the company developed a
   mechanical underground docking method which eliminates the need for
   joint sealing work and applied the method to actual tunneling work. In
   this methoa, after two shields have reached the docking point, space is
   made in the larger shield ({''}concave shield{''}) by, for example,
   retracting the cutter plate, to accommodate the smaller shield
   ({''}convex shield{''}), and the two shields are docked together.
   Complete watertightness is obtained by pushing out an annular seal
   installed on the circumference of the convex shield. This paper reports
   on a study conducted for the field application of the docking method and
   the results of the field application.},

Abstract = {After reminding what coherences spaces are and how they interpret linear
   logic, we define a modality ``flag{''} in the category of coherence
   spaces (or hypercoherences) with two inverse linear (iso)morphisms:
   ``duplication{''} from (flag A) to ((flag A) \&\#x25c1; (flag A)) and
   ``contraction{''} in the opposite direction - where \&\#x25c1; is the
   self dual and non-commutative connective known as ``before{''} in pomset
   logic and known as ``seq(ential){''} in the deep inference system (S)BV.
   In addition, as expected, the coherence space A is a retract of its
   modal image (flag A). This suggests an intuitive interpretation of (flag
   A) as ``repeatedly A{''} or as ``A at any instant{''} when ``before{''}
   is given a temporal interpretation. We hope the semantic construction of
   flag(A) will help to design proof rules for ``flag{''} and we briefly
   discuss this at the end of the paper.},

Abstract = {Handovers are seamless events that occur frequently and naturally
   between people. Although previous works have focused on the design of
   robot handover controllers synthesizing one of the phases of a handover
   (approaching, passing, or retracting) in an isolated manner, we take a
   different approach and treat the handover as a single continuous entity.
   In this paper we present a novel bi-directional and human-inspired
   handover controller using insights we learned from human-human
   experiments. We model the dynamics of the handover in a continuous and
   time-independent way yielding robust and fluid behavior. We implemented
   our approach on a robot platform consisting of a 7-DoF robotic arm with
   a 16-DoF humanoid hand. Our results show that resulting humanrobot
   handovers are smooth and reduce internal forces with the human compared
   to traditional switching approaches.},

   under the umbrella of a meta-theoretic orientation. In the present
   paper, I will review this approach by retracting the development and
   architecture of the model and evaluating its importance from a
   present-day perspective. After that I will summarize my theoretical
   elaborations build on the model and present the current version of the
   model of productive processing of reality. In the third section, I
   demonstrate in which areas of research the model has been used
   empirically, focusing on studies in the area of childhood, youth, health
   / illness and family / school. In the last section, I will take stock of
   the reception of the model in theory and practice.},

Abstract = {The goal of most scientific research published in peer-review journals
   is to discover and report the truth. However, the research record
   includes tongue-in-cheek papers written in the conventional form and
   style of a research paper. Although these papers were intended to be
   taken ironically, bibliographic database searches show that many have
   been subsequently cited as valid research, some in prestigious journals.
   We attempt to understand why so many readers cited such ironic science
   seriously. We draw from the literature on error propagation in research
   publication for ways categorize citations. We adopt the concept of irony
   from the fields of literary and rhetorical criticism to detect,
   characterize, and analyze the interpretations in the more than 60
   published research papers that cite an instance of ironic science. We
   find a variety of interpretations: some citing authors interpret the
   research as valid and accept it, some contradict or reject it, and some
   acknowledge its ironic nature. We conclude that publishing ironic
   science in a research journal can lead to the same troubles posed by
   retracted research, and we recommend relevant changes to publication
   guidelines.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the design of a prototype robotic arm for a
   quadcopter (drone). This prototype is a modular folding mechanism that
   extends from the body of the drone. When fitted with an appropriate
   gripper, this mechanism can be used to retrieve or sample objects and
   then can retract so that the drone can fly with minimal drag from air
   resistance. This foldable robotic arm only uses one actuator to move and
   extends to almost six times its original length. The use of a drone for
   sampling can be advantageous since it can allow access to areas that
   otherwise might be difficult or impossible to reach by Autonomous Ground
   Vehicles (AGV's). In this project, a SolidWorks model of the mechanism
   was created and analyzed, then a prototype of this mechanism was built
   and tested and it has performed as expected.},

Abstract = {This work aims to reflect on the symbolic conditions (Durand, Bachelard)
   that, in cinema, can take part of the image of success. This, considered
   in its requirements of consensus and collective adhesion, is defined
   from the premise of the Imaginary Studies on the representations of the
   logical principles of antithesis, analogy and complexity, pondering that
   the relation with difference is fundamental to understanding the
   symbolic condition of success. With this premise, three of the ten films
   considered the greatest box-office hits of all time are examined: Gone
   with the Wind, Avatar and Titanic. The paper concludes that in both
   Avatar and Titanic there is a dualistic approach to otherness, while in
   Gone with the Wind the approach is monistic. In either case, plurality
   is retracted, with the refusal of the Other's effectiveness as a third

Abstract = {Current mobile context-aware applications for pervasive environments
   have been designed to consume information from computational nodes or
   devices in their surroundings or environments. As the hardware industry
   continues making much smaller, compact and cheap hardware, the vision of
   having plenty of very small powerful digital networking nodes in, for
   e.g., the living room or bedroom, is not so far. Designing software that
   can make optimal use of all these computational nodes when needed is
   still challenging; since software will not only consume information from
   these nodes but parts of the software can be hosted on these different
   nodes. In this paper we propose the BubbleCodes Framework which is a
   generic application partitioning and retraction framework for next
   generation context-aware applications that will have the capabilities to
   partition and retract themselves on multiple computational nodes in a
   pervasive environment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a set of spacecraft consisting of multiple chasers and a
   single target is considered for rendezvous and along-orbit formation
   maneuvers. Each spacecraft can change its experienced drag acceleration
   by extending/retracting drag surfaces. First, the relative states of the
   linearized relative dynamics of each chaser-target pair are driven to
   zero using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Then, a Constrained Least
   Squares (CLS) Problem is formulated to find the best achievable set of
   individual inputs to control all chasers under mutual constraints and
   actuator saturations. Tests using a multiple spacecraft simulation
   framework that includes J(2) perturbation and the NRLMSISE-00
   atmospheric density model, are conducted to validate the robustness of
   the proposed algorithm along with a method that uses the along-orbit
   formation as an intermediate stage to reduce the risk of potential
   collisions.},

   neighborhood retract M being invariant with respect to the resolvents of
   A. The construction is performed under the assumption that resolvents of
   A are completely continuous. In the second part we derive index formulae
   for isolated zeros and apply them to show the existence of nontrivial
   positive steady state solutions for a class of nonlinear
   reaction-diffusion equations and equations with one-dimensional
   p-Laplacian with possibly non-positive perturbations as well as some
   controlled Neumann-like problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The hand gestures used in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are generally
   posed by complicated and large amplitude actions of arm/hand. Thus

   presents new hand shapes and the corresponding recognition system for
   the HCI with robot or Coordinate Measuring Machine. Using a touchpad to
   precept the touching of ringers, hand shapes posed to express HCI
   instructions are defined by the combinations of 2 binary status, i.e.
   status of touching/detaching on touchpad and status of
   stretching/retracting over touchpad, of Index, Middle, Ring and Little
   fingers. Method of extracting the features in hand shape image is
   presented. Based on Neural Network, a decision binary tree is used in
   the real-time recognition of the hand shapes. A correctness ratio of
   about 95\% is obtained when implemented by DSP processor in the
   recognition of 12 hand shapes.},

   Cells},
Journal = {SCIENCE AS CULTURE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-23},
Abstract = {In early 2014, Dr Haruko Obokata and her co-authors caused a global
   media storm by publishing two scientific papers in Nature on stem cells.
   The papers proposed a surprisingly simple new method called
   stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) to generate
   pluripotent stem cells for research purposes in a fast and inexpensive
   way. To the dismay of many, both papers were retracted within six months
   of their release due to data fabrication and falsification. The rise and
   fall of the STAP research illustrates the impacts of open science
   practices of quality control and validation on new scientific claims. In
   the STAP case, collective action generated through two online forums-the
   Knoepfler Lab Stem Cell Blog and PubPeer-exposed not only data
   manipulation in the two papers but also the irreproducibility of the
   purported new cellular reprogramming method. The case brings to the fore
   the tentative possibilities as well as potential pitfalls of
   `accelerated virtual witnessing' through crowdsourced post-publication
   peer reviews that value accessibility and inclusiveness. Indeed, it
   calls for empirically grounded discussion on the ongoing reconfiguration
   of the shared system of values and norms or the moral economy of
   science.},

Abstract = {China's Belt and Road Initiative and its associated domestic industrial
   policies represent a parallel trade and investment strategy that
   challenges the Akamatsu principle of the Flying Geese pattern of
   industrial development in East Asia. This paper is positioned against
   the dominant orthodox theory of national systems of industrial
   development in East Asia. It argues that China's trade and industry
   policy in the 2012-2017 period has demonstrated that government will
   expand its industrial policy market intervention rather than retract,
   moving away from the regional economic integration order by moving
   industrial production and import trade away from the Asia-Pacific along
   a Westward axis to the Indian Ocean and Eurasia. Implications are that
   the emergence of China's geoindustrial policy will subvert multilateral
   trade norms as China begins to institutionalise its external trade and
   industrial policies.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the construction of a general-purpose defeasible
   reasoner that is complete for first-order logic and provably adequate
   for the argument-based conception of defeasible reasoning that I have
   developed elsewhere. Because the set of warranted conclusions for a
   defeasible reasoner will not generally be recursively enumerable, a
   defeasible reasoner based upon a rich logic like the predicate calculus
   cannot function like a traditional theorem prover and simply enumerate
   the warranted conclusions. An alternative criterion of adequacy called
   i.d.e.-adequacy is formulated. This criterion takes seriously the idea
   that defeasible reasoning may involve indefinitely many cycles of
   retracting and reinstating conclusions. It is shown how to construct a
   reasoner that, subject to certain realistic assumptions, is provably
   i.d.e.-adequate. The most recent version of OSCAR implements this
   system. and examples are given of OSCAR's operation.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at developing a highly efficient walking scheme for
   compass-like biped robots with feet. Towards this goal, a latch attached
   to the hip is introduced to lock the hip joint when the hip joint
   retracts to the desired value and spring devices are installed in the
   ankle joints to reduce the inputs of the ankles. Moreover, the stance
   foot allowed to rotate about the toe is considered. With these setups, a
   highly efficient limit-cycle walking gait is obtained by using the
   method of Poincare shooting with the objective of minimizing the
   dimensionless specific mechanical cost of transport. However, this
   limit-cycle walking gait is unstable. To stabilize it, a new control
   strategy is proposed based on transverse coordinate linearization on
   moving Poincare sections. A series of numerical simulations show that
   such a robot model under the proposed control law can walk stably and
   efficiently.},

   ability to develop a proactive strategy towards handling degradations

   community. In this paper, we introduce a methodology using an analogy to
   molecular systems in which a directional wireless network utilizing free
   space optical (FSO) or RF links is modeled as a molecule whose links can
   grow/retract similarly to bonds. A normal mode analysis (NMA) is
   performed to identify link instabilities (degradations and failures) and
   an N-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) is derived with respect
   to network and environmental parameters to aide in the detection of when
   a new topology is available ahead of the topology computation stage.
   Together, the NMA and PES form a basis for a proactive network
   methodology aimed at improving performance in directional wireless
   networks.},

Abstract = {Stable, self-cleansing retraction pockets of the pars tensa are common

   This paper presents the results of surgery using a graft composed of
   cartilage and perichondrium for retraction pockets involving the
   posterior half of the tympanic membrane, as well as early results using
   a larger graft designed to manage retraction of the entire tympanic
   membrane. Data on 51 patients with posterior retraction pockets are
   presented. Forty-two (82 per cent) patients had no aural discharge one
   year following surgery and the tympanic membrane was not retracted in 43
   (84 per cent). The larger `Mercedes-Benz' graft was used in four
   patients and the results obtained suggested that it may prove a
   successful technique for extensive retraction pockets.},

Abstract = {Marcelino Freire, a notable contemporary Brazilian writer, builds a very
   particular fictional universe in which his characters - who come

   their voices in scene to open wide our social woes. This is demonstrated
   in a very special way regarding the hypocrisy of discourses about the
   universality of the rights prescribed by law in a markedly unequal
   country like Brazil. Irony is an important discursive strategy for the
   author in this endeavor and violence seems to be one of the few
   accessible resources used by the voices evoked by Marcelino to invade
   the public space, for which they would never be invited. These are the
   fundamental issues discussed in this paper, in these times when the
   public space retracts and the common interest is supplanted by private
   interest and even rights that are not yet effectively guaranteed are

Abstract = {This paper presents a nanovalve that uses electrodeposited

   thereby closing and opening the nanovalves. Electrodeposited
   nanostructures can be grown and retracted on the electrolyte Surface by
   applying voltages between 5V and -20V at room temperature. The nanovalve
   Successfully closes and opens de-ionized water (DI) now in a 20 mu m
   tall and 500 mu m wide microfluidic channel. Closing and opening a
   single nanovalve takes 5.3 min and 3 min, respectively, with a power
   consumption of 0.08 mW and 0.17mW, respectively. A triple nanovalve
   takes 3.8min and 2.5min to close and open, representing a 28\% and 17\%
   decrease in valving time as compared to a single nanovalve.},

Abstract = {This study characterizes the combustion of paper and sewage sludge in a
   pilot-scale fluidized bed. The highest temperature during combustion
   within the system was found at the surface of the fluidized bed. Paper
   sludge containing roughly 59.8\% water was burned without auxiliary
   fuel, but auxiliary fuel was required to incinerate the sewage sludge,
   which contained about 79.3\% water. The stability of operation was
   monitored based on the average pressure and the standard deviation of
   pressure fluctuations. The average pressure at the surface of the
   fluidized bed decreased as the sludge feed rate increased. However, the
   standard deviation of pressure fluctuations increased as the sludge feed
   rate increased. Finally, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions decreased as
   oxygen content increased in the flue gas, and nitrogen oxide (NOx)
   emissions were also tied with oxygen content.},

Abstract = {Chip breakability plays an essential role in automated machining
   systems. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the
   effects of progressive tool wear and the resulting formation of the tool
   restricted contact on chip breakability in a turning operation. Six
   parameters of tool wear, namely, major flank wear (VB), crater wear
   depth (KT), crater wear length (KK), crater wear width (KB), wear
   retract of cutting edge (KS) and nose wear (N), are shown to contribute
   to the variations of chip breakability with tool wear progression. The
   results show that the chip breakability varies significantly with tool
   wear progression, especially with the combined crater and flank wear
   progression, and contributes to the development of a restricted rake
   face land, making the tool behave like a restricted contact grooved
   tool. The chip curling and breaking action is largely influenced by the
   nature and magnitude of the restricted contact and the groove profile
   being developed on the tool face. The results presented in this paper
   are also intended to provide guidelines for designing effective chip
   grooves on the tool face.},

Abstract = {Academic publishing is undergoing a highly transformative process, and
   many established rules and value systems that are in place, such as
   traditional peer review (TPR) and preprints, are facing unprecedented
   challenges, including as a result of post-publication peer review. The
   integrity and validity of the academic literature continue to rely
   naively on blind trust, while TPR and preprints continue to fail to
   effectively screen out errors, fraud, and misconduct. Imperfect TPR
   invariably results in imperfect papers that have passed through varying
   levels of rigor of screening and validation. If errors or misconduct
   were not detected during TPR's editorial screening, but are detected at
   the post-publication stage, an opportunity is created to correct the
   academic record. Currently, the most common forms of correcting the
   academic literature are errata, corrigenda, expressions of concern, and
   retractions or withdrawals. Some additional measures to correct the
   literature have emerged, including manuscript versioning, amendments,
   partial retractions and retract and replace. Preprints can also be
   corrected if their version is updated. This paper discusses the risks,
   benefits and limitations of these forms of correcting the academic
   literature.},

Title = {Circumferential dissection of deep fascia as ancillary technique in
   circumcision: is it possible to correct phimosis increasing penis size?},
Journal = {BMC UROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Background: Phimosis is the inability to retract the preputium downward
   over the glans penis. Despite the various techniques of preputial plasty
   described in literature, the most performed surgical treatment is still
   the conventional circumcision.
   Methods: In this paper we retrospectively reviewed data of a homogeneous
   population of 36 consecutive adult patients who underwent phimosis
   correction by circumcsion with dissection of the Deep Fascia. Patients
   were followed up by one independent plastic surgeon that measured penis
   length and circumference in nonerected state preoperatively and at 6
   month time postoperatively.
   Results: The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test showed a significant (p < 0.0001)
   difference between the two groups both in terms of length and
   circumference.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the ancillary technique we described leads
   to an increase of penis size, is safe and easy to perform and does not
   increase significantly operative time nor complication rate to the
   conventional procedure.},

   Slats},

Volume = {59},

Pages = {297-304},

Abstract = {To effectively reduce or eliminate the warping deformation of the slat
   trailing edge, the prebending design is widely used. However, excessive
   bending of the slate trailing edge may cause the structure to stick when
   the slat is retracted, thereby affecting the aerodynamic performance of
   the aircraft. There is a strong motivation for modeling and analysis of
   a prebending leading-edge slat. First, the rigid-flexible coupling
   theory model is established in this paper. Second, a rigid-flexible
   simulation of a leading-edge slat is carried out based on multibody
   dynamics and finite element analysis; Besides, the dynamic response
   properties of the leading-edge slat under multifactor coupling working
   conditions are obtained. Finally, the influences of the driving speed
   and prebending angle on the slat retraction are analyzed. The results of
   this study may help to provide a reference for the evaluation and
   optimization of the leading-edge slat's retractability.},

Abstract = {Data integration on a human-manageable scale, by users without database
   expertise, is a more common activity than integration of large
   databases. Users often gather fine-grained data and organize it in an
   entity-centric way, developing tables of information regarding
   real-world objects, ideas, or people. Often, they do this by copying and
   pasting bits of data from e-mails, databases, or text files into a
   spreadsheet. During this process, users evolve their notions of entities
   and attributes. They combine sets of entities or attributes, split them
   again, update attribute values, and retract those updates. These
   functions are neither well supported by current tools, nor formally well
   understood. Our research seeks to capture and make explicit the data
   integration decisions made during these activities. In this paper, we
   formally define entity resolution and deresolution, and show that these
   functions behave predictably and intuitively in the presence of
   attribute value updates.},

Abstract = {During contractual negotiations, parties often make reliance
   expenditures that would increase the surplus should a contract be made.
   This paper analyzes decisions to invest in precontractual reliance under
   alternative legal regimes. Investments in reliance will be socially
   suboptimal in the absence of any precontractual liability-and will be
   socially excessive under strict liability for all reliance expenditures.
   Given the results for these polar cases, we focus on exploring how
   ``intermediate{''}-liability rules could be best designed to induce
   efficient reliance decisions. One of our results indicates that the case
   for liability is shown to be stronger when a party retracts from terms
   that it has proposed or from preliminary understandings reached by the
   parties. Our results have implications, which we discuss, for various
   contract doctrines and debates. Finally, we show that precontractual
   liability does not necessarily have an overall adverse effect on
   parties' decisions to enter into contractual negotiations.},

Abstract = {Let A circle times(t) C be a twisted tensor product of an algebra A and
   a coalgebra C, along a twisting cochain t : C -> A. By means of what is
   called the tensor trick and under some nice conditions, Gugenheim, Lambe
   and Stasheff proved in the early 90s that A circle times(t) C is
   homology equivalent to the objects M circle times(t') C and A circle
   times(t{''}) N, where M and N are strong deformation retracts of A and
   C, respectively. In this paper, we attack this problem from the point of
   view of contractions. We find explicit contractions from A circle
   times(t) C to M circle times(t') C and A circle times(t{''}) N.
   Applications to the comparison of resolutions which split off of the bar
   resolution, as well as to some homological models for central extensions
   are given.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Abstract = {We have examined the estimates in Pramod et al. of IUU Alaskan Pollock
   imported into Japan. Based on extensive knowledge of this fishery we
   find that their estimates are not substantiated by any known facts from
   the fishery. Whereas in a retracted version of the paper the authors
   estimated that 15-22\% of Alaskan Pollock imported into Japan were IUU
   and listed the sources as discards \& high-grading; unreported by-catch
   in trawl fisheries and unreported catches in artisanal fisheries, the
   authors have now added blending of IUU Pollock overseas with Alaskan
   Pollock as the dominant source of IUU Alaskan Pollock entering Japan.
   Remarkably, the authors estimate the same 15-22\%, and continue to
   assert that discarded and high-graded fish in Alaska somehow make their
   way to Japan. None of the citations provided in the Pramod et al. paper
   provide any estimates of IUU, so their numerical estimates must
   therefore come from two confidential informants. No documentation of how
   the estimates are made is provided and the paper completely fails to
   meet normal standards of scientific replicability. The deficiencies in
   the estimate of IUU in Alaskan Pollock must cast serious doubt on their
   approach for all fisheries.},

   by all those compacta having the shape of finite polyhedra. As a
   corollary we get that for a still wide subclass, that whose elements are
   also absolute neighborhood retracts (ANR's), the homotopy properties are
   also preserved under appropriate digitizations. Our results are based in
   approximation results by finite polyhedra and on the fact that the usual
   digitizations, when applied to finite polyhedra, preserve the homotopy
   type. Moreover, we show that if a set does not have the shape of a
   finite polyhedron, then there is not any possible way to digitize it
   while having its shape preserved.},

Abstract = {The medial axis is transform is a representation of an object which has
   been shown to be useful in design, interrogation, animation, finite
   element mesh generation, performance analysis, manufacturing simulation,
   path planning, and tolerance specification. In this paper, the theory of
   the medial axis transform for 3-D objects is developed. For objects with
   piecewise C-2 boundaries, relationships between the curvature of the
   boundary and the position of the medial axis are developed. For
   n-dimensional submanifolds of R(n) with boundaries which are piecewise
   C-2 and completely G(1), a deformation retract is set up between each
   object and its medial axis, which demonstrates that if the object is
   path connected, then so is its medial axis. Finally, it is proven that
   path connected polyhedral solids without cavities have path connected
   medial axes. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Title = {Analysis of trace contaminants in hot gas streams using time-weighted
   average solid-phase microextraction: Proof of concept},

Abstract = {Time-weighted average (TWA) passive sampling using solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography was investigated as a new
   method of collecting, identifying and quantifying contaminants in
   process gas streams. Unlike previous TWA-SPME techniques using the
   retracted fiber configuration (fiber within needle) to monitor ambient
   conditions or relatively stagnant gases, this method was developed for
   fast-moving process gas streams at temperatures approaching 300 degrees
   C. The goal was to develop a consistent and reliable method of analyzing
   low concentrations of contaminants in hot gas streams without performing
   time-consuming exhaustive extraction with a slipstream. This work in
   particular aims to quantify trace tar compounds found in a syngas stream
   generated from biomass gasification. This paper evaluates the concept of
   retracted SPME at high temperatures by testing the three essential
   requirements for TWA passive sampling: (1) zero-sink assumption, (2)
   consistent and reliable response by the sampling device to changing
   concentrations, and (3) equal concentrations in the bulk gas stream
   relative to the face of the fiber syringe opening. Results indicated the
   method can accurately predict gas stream concentrations at elevated
   temperatures. Evidence was also discovered to validate the existence of
   a second boundary layer within the fiber during the
   adsorption/absorption process. This limits the technique to operating
   within reasonable mass loadings and loading rates, established by
   appropriate sampling depths and times for concentrations of interest. A
   limit of quantification for the benzene model tar system was estimated
   at 0.02 g m(-3) (8 ppm) with a limit of detection of 0.5 mg m(-3) (200
   ppb). Using the appropriate conditions, the technique was applied to a
   pilot-scale fluidized-bed gasifier to verify its feasibility. Results
   from this test were in good agreement with literature and prior pilot
   plant operation, indicating the new method can measure low
   concentrations of tar in gasification streams. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Cleft palate is one of common congenital malformations that has huge
   impacts on the physical and psychological health of patients. Pharyngeal
   fricative in cleft palate speech is a kind of common compensatory
   articulations, which is produced by retracting tongue position to
   posterior pharyngeal wall and narrowing velopharyngeal opening. In this
   paper, based on voice mechanism of pharyngeal fricatives in cleft palate
   speech, linear prediction inverse filter was used to extract glottal
   waveform and estimate vocal tract model coefficients. Then four features
   were extracted, including pitch period, glottal flow derivative
   waveform, vocal tract area and vocal tract gain. The cross-correlation
   function was used to calculate the correlation between features. Glottal
   flow derivative waveform was removed since it had strong correlation
   with the others. KNN classifier was applied to realize the automatic
   pharyngeal fricatives detection in cleft palate speech, which reaches
   the detection accuracy of 98.40\%.},

   characterization and evaluation software using a new concept to ``Sense

   operations. The soil properties and ground water conditions ahead of the
   machine are obtained by a specially designed tunnel boring machine
   instrumented with an automatically advancing and retracting miniature
   piezocone penetrometer in front of it. The acquired data is processed in
   real time to evaluate the engineering properties of the soil that are
   also displayed on a computer screen in graphic form. Such real time data
   acquisition gives continuously updated information of the soil ahead
   which can be used to accurately control the tunnel boring operation
   using an intelligent closed-loop computer-controlled feedback process.},

Abstract = {Cases of research misconduct in the ecological and environmental
   sciences appear to be relatively rare. A controversial paper published
   in Science in 2016 documenting the effects of microplastics on the
   feeding and innate behaviours of fish larvae has recently been
   retracted, with the authors found guilty of scientific misconduct. In
   addition to the expected fallout, such as individual and institutional
   reputational damage from a research misconduct finding, this case has
   two possibly wider-ranging ramifications. Firstly, there may be a
   presumptive notion that a strong negative effect could be more
   successfully published than a neutral effect. This presumption would
   belie the true stringency and rigor of research adopted by workers in
   the field. Secondly, the case may have a negative impact on the public's
   perception of and trust in legitimate and good science that addresses
   critical environmental issues, such as anthropogenic climate change.},

Number = {3},

Abstract = {Empirical studies have demonstrated that electrical activity of the
   neuron can directly affect neurite outgrowth. High levels of activity
   cause neurites to retract, whereas low levels allow further outgrowth.
   Previously we studied networks in which all the cells reacted in the
   same way on electrical activity. Since experiments have shown that
   neurons may in fact react differentially, we study in this paper
   networks in which the range of activity where outgrowth takes place
   varies among cells. We show that this can lead to complex periodic
   behaviour in electrical activity and connectivity of individual cells.
   The precise behaviour depends on the spatial distribution of the cells
   and the distribution of the outgrowth properties over the cells.
   Any other cellular property that adapts slowly to electrical activity
   such that neuronal activity is attempted to be maintained at a given
   level, can lead to similar results. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited.},

Abstract = {The projective orthogonal and symplectic groups POn (F) and PSp(n) (F)
   have a natural action on the F vector space V' = M-n(F) circle plus
   (...) circle plus M-n (F). Here we assume F is an infinite field of
   characteristic not 2. If we assume there is more than one summand in V',
   then the invariant fields F(V')(POn) and F(V')(PSpn) are natural
   objects. They are, for example, the centers of generic algebras with the
   appropriate kind of involution. This paper considers the rationality
   properties of these fields, in the case 1, 2, or 4 are the highest
   powers of 2 that divide n. We derive rationality when n is odd, or when
   2 is the highest power, and stable rationality when 4 is the highest
   power. In a companion paper joint with Tignol, we prove retract
   rationality when 8 is the highest power of 2 dividing n. Back in this
   paper, along the way, we consider two generic ways of forcing a Brauer
   class to be in the image of restriction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Currently, most tasks submitted to earth observation satellites (EOSs)
   are with deadlines, to satisfy users' timing requirements. Besides,
   tasks are normally submitted dynamically,. with uncertainties of tasks
   number and submission times. In this paper, we establish a
   multi-objective mathematic programming model for dynamic real-time
   scheduling of EOSs. To improve user's revenue and resource.utilization,
   a task dynamic merging strategy is proposed. With the dynamic merging in
   place, plus consideration of retracting and rearranging some scheduled
   tasks to make room for incorporating the newly arrived tasks, we present
   a novel dynamic real-time scheduling algorithm-DMTRH. To demonstrate the
   superiority of our DMTRH, we conduct extensive experiments by
   simulations to compare DMTRH with two algorithms-RHTSS and STI. The
   experimental results indicate that DMTRH improves the scheduling quality
   of others and is suitable for dynamic real-time scheduling. Crown

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of control of the tug-debris space
   tether system for debris De-orbiting. The motion of the tether system is
   considered when the space tug and tethered debris have an initial
   relative velocity, which can affect the tether tension. We investigate
   two stages of the space tether motion: tether elongation stage and
   tether retraction stage. Two control laws for the tether length are
   proposed for the each stage. The control law for the first stage is
   based on the measurement of the tether tension and is intended to
   decrease the relative velocity between the space tug and debris object.
   The control law for the second stage retracts the tether and decrease
   the distance between the space tug and debris assisting to the process
   of the docking of the space tug with debris. The proposed control laws
   are demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

   avoids collisions by automatically detecting such obstacles at about 70m
   in front of the train and retracting the pantograph in time. The system
   consists of three cameras mounted collinearly inside the train behind
   the front window.
   Up to now, the system only works when sufficient daylight is available.
   In this paper, we present methods for extending the system for operation
   at night and in tunnels. Within this context extension means that our
   concept of stereo triangulation via three cameras is to be kept as far
   as possible.
   In this paper, active as well as passive night vision techniques in the
   ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectrum are surveyed. Overall
   concepts for day-dawn-night vision are shown. These concepts are
   analyzed with regard to their applicability and results are presented.
   We conclude that thermal infrared is the best technique for our
   application since day and night images look the same.},

Abstract = {The legitimate devices are easy to be attacked in wireless transmission,
   which is harmful for communication security. As a candidate technology
   for the sixth-generation (6G) network, reconfigurable intelligent
   surface (RIS) has attracted much attention due to its ability to enhance
   the security of wireless communication. Existing works for RIS-assisted
   security design generally assume that the phase shift matrices of RIS
   are the same, which limits the security performance of the RIS-assisted
   system. In this paper, taking into account the independent optimization
   of each RIS, we develop the relax-and-retract based joint transmit and
   reflecting beamforming to enhance the received signal of the legitimate
   device and mitigate anti-jamming signal of the jammer. Simulation
   results verify that our developed scheme can enhance the anti-jamming
   performance of multiple RISs (multi-RIS) assisted aerial-ground system
   with lower complexity compared with existing methods.},

Abstract = {This paper presents experiments on the retraction/deployment of an
   active-passive composited driving deployable boom for space probes. To
   satisfy the requirements of accurate position tracking and unrumpled
   retraction/deployment of the boom, it is essential to maintain energy
   equilibrium in the retracting/deploying process and simultaneously
   compensate the model for uncertainties when controlling the deployable
   boom. To this end, parameter matching among the drive motor, reaction
   spring and lenticular boomis deduced from the energy equilibrium
   constraints of the system, and an adaptive controller augmented with a
   robust controller is investigated to compensate for or reject the effect
   of model uncertainties. Particularly, a terrestrial experimental setup
   is established to validate the efficiency of the parameter matching and
   the composited controller for the deployable boom. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the designed deployable boom can track the
   desired trajectory accurately with unrumpled retraction/deployment. (C)

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel space structure and its mathematic analysis for

   measure medium distributions and contents in a circular cross section of

   all arms stretching and retracting simultaneously. At the end of each
   arm a reflecting prism is employed to realize the transformation of the
   rays in the arm and the measured plane. Fibre cable and photoelectrical
   devices can be sealed in the arms or pole specially designed to
   withstand conditions such as high temperature and high pressure. A

Abstract = {A novel Vane Pump Power Split Transmission (VPPST), applied to a class 1
   pickup truck, is demonstrated in this paper. The VPPST, a power split
   hydraulic transmission consists of Vane Pump Power Split Unit (VPSU) and
   a variable displacement hydraulic motor. The VPSU is a double acting
   vane pump with a floating ring. The floating ring is coupled to the
   output shaft, which is connected to the drive shaft. The input shaft of
   the VPSU is coupled to the engine. The control flow of the VPSU is fed
   to a variable displacement motor mounted on the VPSU output shaft. The
   transmission ratio is adjusted by controlling the displacement of the
   variable motor. The resulting continuous variable transmission allows
   for optimum engine operation by decoupling the engine speed from the
   drive speed. The transmission also has an integral clutch that allows
   de-clutching the engine from the drive train by retracting the vanes of
   the VPSU. In this paper, a quasi-static simulation approach is used to
   study the performance of the transmission.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS},

Abstract = {A liquid filament recoils because of its surface tension. It may recoil
   to one sphere, the geometrical shape with lowest surface, or otherwise
   segment to several pieces which individually will recoil to spheres.
   This experiment is classical and its exploration is fundamental to the
   understanding of how liquid volumes relax. In this paper, we uncover a
   mechanism involving the creation of a vortex ring which plays a central
   role in escaping segmentation. The retracting blob is connected to the
   untouched filament by a neck. The radius of the neck decreases in time
   such that we may expect pinch-off. There is a flow through the neck
   because of the retraction. This flow may detach into a jet downstream of
   the neck when fluid viscosity exceeds a threshold. This sudden
   detachment creates a vortex ring which strongly modifies the flow
   pressure: fluid is expelled back into the neck which in turn reopens.},

Abstract = {Many approaches to handle inconsistent knowledge require some
   information to be dropped in order to ensure logical consistency. In
   this paper, a syntax-based technique that simply weakens the conflicting
   information by means of semaphores is proposed and analyzed in the
   context of the fusion of several possibly mutually conflicting knowledge
   sources. The proposed approach basically adopts a neutral position
   w.r.t. two knowledge sources in the sense that it does not conduct one
   source to predominate the other one. However marking a preference for
   one source and retracting this preference is easy. When the fusion
   process is iterated, it is shown that semaphores can conduct sources to
   become actually rejected. Conditions preventing such a drawback are
   investigated. It is also shown how this problem can be solved when all
   sources are available simultaneously and how a preference for
   less-contradicted sources can be realized as well.},

Abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging modality
   with the potential to provide in situ assessment to distinguish normal
   from cancerous tissue. However, limited image penetration depth has
   restricted its utility. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an
   OCT needle probe to perform interstitial imaging deep below the tissue
   surface. The side-facing needle probe comprises miniaturized focusing
   optics consisting of no-core and GRIN fiber encased within either a 22-
   or 23-gauge needle. 3-D OCT volumetric data sets were acquired by
   rotating and retracting the probe during imaging. We present the first
   published image of a human breast cancer tumor margin, and of human
   axillary lymph nodes acquired with an OCT needle probe. Through accurate
   correlation with the histological gold standard, OCT is shown to enable
   a clear delineation of tumor boundary from surrounding adipose tissue,
   and identification of microarchitectural features.},

Abstract = {Applying system identification methodology, an aerodynamic database
   covering the entire operational flight envelope, was estimated from
   Transall flight data, This paper emphasizes the modeling and
   identification of some of the Transall specific operational
   characteristics such as the ramp door and dropping of heavy loads, In
   addition, aerodynamic effects because of speed brakes and landing pear
   are determined applying a nonlinear maximum likelihood parameter
   estimation method, The identification results indicate that the speed
   brakes function as pure drag generators only for the retracted landing
   flaps. Fbr extended landing flaps, applying speed brakes affects the
   aircraft pitching motion. The landing gear is found to affect both the
   longitudinal and lateral-directional aircraft motion. Opening of the
   ramp door results in an effectively enlarged fuselage, affecting mostly
   the lateral-directional motion, It is demonstrated that the load
   dropping can be adequately modeled by properly accounting for the
   variations in the aircraft mass characteristics.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the design and manufacture of a compact telescopic
   morphing lattice (CTML) space boom. This boom stows within a 1U CubeSat
   volume and weighs only 0.475kg. Once deployed, the CTML has a total
   length of 2m, 20 times the stowed height. The device consists of three
   multi stable cylindrical composite lattices connected in series. To
   improve packaging efficiency, these lattices nest inside one another in
   the stowed configuration. The morphing lattice is a structure that uses
   prestress and lamina orientation to seamlessly morph from a short stowed
   state to a long deployed state. By tailoring the manufacturing
   parameters, the lattices in the boom have been designed to maximize the
   deployment force and to be self-deploying. Therefore, the CTML only
   requires a small, lightweight mechanism to regulate the deployment
   speed. The deployment speed regulator can also potentially retract the
   boom back to the stowed state, facilitating reconfigurability.},

Title = {Accurate flexural spring constant calibration of colloid probe
   cantilevers using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry},
Journal = {NANOTECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {23},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Calibration of the flexural spring constant for atomic force microscope
   (AFM) colloid probe cantilevers provides significant challenges. The
   presence of a large attached spherical added mass complicates many of
   the more common calibration techniques such as reference cantilever,
   Sader, and added mass. Even the most promising option, AFM thermal
   calibration, can encounter difficulties during the optical lever
   sensitivity measurement due to strong adhesion and friction between the
   sphere and a surface. This may cause buckling of the end of the
   cantilever and hysteresis in the approach-retract curves resulting in
   increased uncertainty in the calibration. Most recently, a laser Doppler
   vibrometry thermal method has been used to accurately calibrate the
   normal spring constant of a wide variety of tipped and tipless
   commercial cantilevers. This paper describes a variant of the technique,
   scanning laser Doppler vibrometry, optimized for colloid probe
   cantilevers and capable of spring constant calibration uncertainties
   near +/- 1\%.},

Abstract = {In his recent book, Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong, Jerry
   Fodor retracts the radical concept-nativism he once defended. Yet that
   position stood, virtually unchallenged, for more than twenty years. This
   neglect is puzzling, as Fodor's arguments against concepts being
   learnable from experience remain unanswered, and nativism has
   historically been taken very seriously as a response to empiricism's
   perceived shortcomings. In this paper, I urge that Fodorean nativism
   should indeed be rejected. I argue, however, that its deficiencies are
   not so obvious that they can simply be taken for granted. Fodor can
   counter extant objections by stressing two distinctions: between
   historicist and counterfactual semantic theories and between explaining
   reference and explaining concept-acquisition. But, I argue, this victory
   is pyrrhic. Reformulated as objections to his account qua theory of
   concept-acquisition, and not qua theory of reference, analogous
   difficulties are fatal to the Fodorean position.},

   replicate the movement of the user's hand to extend, retract, and rotate
   accordingly to accurately position as required for the application. The

Abstract = {Blade Technology in Clovis Assemblages in Kentucky: A Brief Comparison

   Brian Redmond on the Paleo Crossing Site, it has become clear we made an
   error in understanding. Eren has explained to the authors that in using
   the word prominent to characterize blades in Clovis assemblages, his
   intention was to point out that their presence is noteworthy and not to
   comment on their frequency. It is clear in our conversations and review
   of his paper, that there are no explicit statements regarding the
   numbers or proportions of blades at the Paleo Crossing Site or
   throughout Clovis culture as a whole. We apologize to Eren and Redmond
   for this misunderstanding and retract our statements in regards to their
   excellent study. Crista M. Haag, MA, Principal Archaeologist},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the high efficient walking problem of a planar
   compass-like biped robot with massless feet. The walking manner with the
   stance foot allowed to rotate about the toe, is considered. A latch
   attached to the hip is introduced to lock the hip joint, which works
   when the hip joint retracts to a desired angle, and spring devices are
   equipped at the ankle joints to reduce the inputs of the ankles. After
   modeling the walking robot as a hybrid system with multiple continuous
   state spaces, a high efficient walking gait limit cycle is found using
   the method of Poincare shooting with the objective of minimizing the
   dimensionless specific mechanical cost of transport. Then, an
   event-based feedback control law is proposed to stabilize the high
   efficient walking gait. The validity of our control strategies is
   illustrated by a series of numerical simulations.},

Abstract = {In this paper we define a set of radii called thickness for simple
   closed curves denoted by K, which are assumed to be differentiable.
   These radii capture a balanced view between the geometric and the
   topological properties of these curves. One can think of these radii as
   representing the thickness of at rope in space and of R as the core of
   the rope. Great care is taken to define our radii in order to gain
   freedom from small pieces with large curvature in the curve.
   Intuitively, this means that we tend to allow the surface of the ropes
   that represent the knots to deform into a non smooth surface. But as
   long as the radius of the rope is less than the thickness so defined,
   the surface of the rope will remain a two manifold and the rope (as a
   solid torus) can be deformed onto K via strong deformation retract. In
   this paper we explore basic properties of these thicknesses and discuss
   the relationship amongst them.},

   a solution to measure both the translation/rotation of the catheter and
   the pushing/retracting resistance force and twisting resistance torque
   caused by multiregion contacts between the catheter and the vascular
   wall. The prototype has been validated with manipulation experiments of
   inserting a catheter into a vascular phantom model. The results
   illustrate that the device can detect collisions between the catheter
   and the vascular walls. Subtle force/torque changes caused by changes of
   movement direction can be detected. Force/torque changes at some
   critical point, such as the intersection point of vessels, can also be
   detected. The measurement of the catheter position can cover required
   ranges of translation or rotation.},

Abstract = {Presynaptic nerve terminals are located at the ends of nerve cells; a
   signal propagating through a nerve cell reaches one of these
   compartments before being transmitted to an adjacent nerve cell.
   A tethered particle system (TPS) is a type of impulse-based model
   recently developed for the simulation of deformable biological
   structures. In a TPS, collisions can cause approaching particles to
   rebound outwards, as one would expect, but they can also caused
   separating particles to retract inwards.
   This paper demonstrates how a TPS can be used to simulate biological
   systems by presenting its application to a presynaptic nerve terminal.
   The model captures the clustering of sacs called vesicles in the
   presence of protein called synapsin. Both rigid and deformable membranes
   are also described. The simulated presynaptic nerve terminal may be
   used, for example, to predict how a change in synapsin concentration
   affects the size of vesicle clusters.},

   proved. This formula provides an infinite-dimensional counterpart of the
   well-known Krasnosel'skii theorem. By the use of the introduced
   topological degree and an abstract result concerning branching of fixed

Abstract = {Suppose M is a noncompact connected oriented C(infinity) n-manifold and
   omega is a positive volume form on M. Let D(+) (M) denote the group of
   orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of M endowed with the
   compact-open C(infinity) topology and let D(M; omega) denote the
   subgroup of omega-preserving diffeomorphisms of M. In this paper we
   propose a unified approach for realization of mass transfer toward ends
   by diffeomorphisms of M. This argument, together with Moser's theorem,
   enables us to deduce two selection theorems for the groups D(+) (M) and
   D(M; omega). The first one is the extension of Moser's theorem to
   noncompact manifolds, that is, the existence of sections for the orbit
   maps under the action of D(+) (M) on the space of volume forms. This
   implies that D(M; omega) is a strong deformation retract of the group
   D(+) (M; E(M)(omega)) consisting of h is an element of D(+) (M), which
   preserves the set E(M)(omega) of omega-finite ends of M. The second one
   is related to the mass flow toward ends under volume-preserving
   diffeomorphisms of M. Let D(EM) (M; omega) denote the subgroup
   consisting of all h is an element of D(M; omega) which fix the ends E(M)
   of M. S. R. Alpern and V. S. Prasad introduced the topological vector
   space S(M; omega) of end charges of M and the end charge homomorphisrn
   c(omega) D(EM) (M; omega) -> S(M; omega), which measures the mass flow
   toward ends induced by each h is an element of D(EM) (M; omega). We show
   that the homomorphism c(omega) has a continuous section. This induces
   the factorization D(EM) (M; omega) congruent to ker c(omega) x S(M;
   omega), and it implies that ker c(omega) is a strong deformation retract
   of D(EM) (M; omega).},

Abstract = {In this paper, a set of low Earth orbiting spacecraft consisting of
   multiple chasers and a single cooperative or unknown target, is
   considered for rendezvous and along-orbit formation maneuvers. Each
   maneuverable spacecraft can change its experienced atmospheric drag
   acceleration by extending/retracting dedicated surfaces. A
   Lyapunov-based adaptive controller is designed using an Integral
   Concurrent Learning (ICL)-based adaptive update law and the
   Schweighart-Sedwick equations of relative motion to regulate the
   in-plane relative states of each target-chaser pair. The controller is
   designed to compensate for uncertainties in atmospheric density, drag or
   ballistic coefficient and the velocity relative to the atmosphere of
   each spacecraft in the fleet. When the system is sufficiently excited,
   the controller also provides estimation of the uncertain parameters.
   Numerical simulations using nonlinear dynamics for each spacecraft and
   the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric density model, are conducted to validate the
   performance of the controller.},

Abstract = {Retraction of scientific publications can unmask scientific misconduct.
   We undertook a survey of publication rates, for authors with multiple
   retractions in the biomedical literature, to determine whether they
   changed after authors' first retractions. We collected publication and
   citation data from Scopus for 100 authors with multiple retractions
   (either >10 retractions or 2-5 retractions) in the Retraction Watch
   database. Publication rates increased until the year of the first
   retraction and decreased rapidly thereafter. By 4 years after the first
   retraction, the proportion of authors actively publishing at least one
   paper/year was <50\%, annual publication rates were <50\% of the
   pre-retraction rate, and only 22\% of authors had a publication rate
   >50\% of their pre-retraction rate. There was no difference in the
   decline in publication rates between authors associated with a
   retraction for misconduct and those not associated with such a
   retraction. After the first retraction, citation rates of retracted
   papers declined whereas those of unretracted papers by the same authors
   remained unchanged. In summary, publication rates of authors with
   multiple retractions, most of whom were associated with scientific
   misconduct, declined rapidly after their first retraction but a small
   minority continued to publish regularly.},

Abstract = {Wood is the most important, industrially used renewable resource on the
   planet, but the aging mechanism of biopolymers on cell walls is poorly
   understood. Adhesion properties are of critical importance for wood and
   many other lignocellulosic materials. We used atomic force microscopy
   and defined the jump-off force ratio in the retract force-displacement
   curve to study the adhesion force phenomenon and the effects of heat
   treatments. Here, we identified two sigmoidal curves describing the
   shift of the adhesion force and the jump-off force ratio: the first
   curve was attributed to the movement of extractives and the second to
   the degradation of the hemicellulose-lignin matrix. We confirmed the
   hypothesis formulated in this paper by the cell wall surface topography,
   the analysis of the treated samples by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy, and the analysis of volatiles during heating by headspace
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.},

Abstract = {A new approach is presented in this paper for modeling and control of an
   automated deburring process that utilizes a hybrid robot and a compliant
   toolhead. The robot is used for motion control while the toolhead is
   used for force control. This toolhead has a pneumatic spindle that can
   be extended and retracted by three pneumatic actuators to provide the
   tool compliance. The model for deburring process is developed based on
   the dynamics of the compliant toolhead and the micro-contact model. By
   integrating a linear encoder, this toolhead can be used for on-line burr
   measurement through sensing the tool length variation due to burrs. For
   the deburring control, a closed-loop tool length controller is developed
   to regulate the tool length through the tool length sensing. This
   control method has been modeled, simulated, and implemented. Both
   simulation and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   presented method.},

Abstract = {LHCb is one of the four main experiments of the Large Hadron Collider
   (LHC) project, which will start at CERN in 2008. The experiment is
   primarily dedicated to B-Physics and hence requires precise vertex
   reconstruction. The silicon vertex locator (VELO) has a single hit
   precision of better than 10 mu m and is used both off-line and in the
   trigger. These requirements place strict constraints on its alignment.
   Additional challenges for the alignment arise from the detector being
   retracted between each fill of the LHC and from its unique circular disc
   r/phi strip geometry. This paper describes the track-based software
   alignment procedure developed for the VELO. The procedure is primarily
   based on a non-iterative method using a matrix inversion technique. The
   procedure is demonstrated with simulated events to be fast, robust and
   to achieve a suitable alignment precision. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This paper introduces a method for the simulation of motions of a
   satellite which, while in motion, extrudes or retracts a long, elastic
   appendage. The undeployed part of the appendage which is assumed to be
   wrapped around a drum whose axis is fixed in the satellite is taken into
   account. The method is used to generate equations governing the motion
   of the entire system, coming to grips with the fact that the elastic
   properties of the deployed part of the appendage are time-dependent. It
   is shown that whereas the radius of the drum has a small effect on the
   dynamic behavior the satellite during deployment/retraction, the
   location of the centerpoint of the drum with respect to the mass center
   of the satellite is significant, and a location can be found that will
   leave the orientation of the satellite during deployment/retraction
   practically intact.},

Abstract = {The introduction of through-running trains between England and France
   has required the provision of shoegear to run on the British Rail (BR)
   system, and this shoegear must retract clear of the rail for operation
   in France and Belgium (SNCF and SNCB). This paper describes the shoegear
   development work. An initial design concept was compared with existing
   experience; mock-ups were tested to confirm essential interfaces with
   the bogie and track, and prototypes were installed on a test train. The
   paper will describe the experiences of these trials and the running of
   the pre-series train on BR and SNCF.
   GEC-Alsthom, the main contractor for the TMST Eurostar trains, awarded
   the contract for current collection to a joint venture between
   Brecknell, Willis of Chard, England, and Faiveley SA of Tours, France.
   The two companies have a total of 180 years experience in electric
   traction and the shoegear design was to be a joint exercise.
   A version of this paper was originally presented at the Railtech
   conference in May 1994; since that time the Eurostars have entered full
   passenger service and the shoegear has met the requirements of full

Abstract = {With the increasing demand for new sources of energy, solar power has
   become an attractive solution for the current energy crisis.
   Photovoltaic systems have been increasingly used in the form of solar
   panel arrays. However, despite the numerous advantages of solar
   technology, the energy-conversion efficiency of solar panels is low.
   Since these panels are stationary, they are also difficult to deploy and
   transport and are prone to damages and hindrance. The portable system
   prototype proposed in this paper can deploy the solar panels easily and
   retract them with minimal effort based on the Miura origami folding
   patterns and mechanical rotation of the panels. An active dual-axis
   solar tracking system based on tilt-and-swing mechanism is added to the
   system to maximize the efficiency of the solar energy conversion. This
   inexpensive solar-tracking system is composed of an Arduino
   microcontroller, photoresistors, and stepper motors. The mechanism of
   the proposed system is fully explained in this paper and it is
   demonstrated how this portable system can maximize the efficiency of the
   energy conversion.},

Abstract = {Strategies to suppress the coffee-ring effect are critical in various
   applications, such as printing, surface manufacturing, and biochemical
   analysis. We propose a simple and contactless method based on forced
   airflow to obtain uniform depositions of drying colloidal droplets in
   this work. This method eliminates the coffee-ring effect without
   chemical/physical modifications of the suspensions and substrates. The
   tangential liquid flow in the drying droplets caused by forced airflow
   prevents nanoparticles from accumulating on the periphery and diminishes
   the three-phase contact line's pinning. The contact line retracts
   continuously and smoothly, resulting in a relatively uniform stain
   pattern. This paper experimentally explores several critical parameters
   in this strategy, including the droplet volume, the distance between
   droplets and the air inlet pipe, and forced airflow velocity. Our
   comprehensive study of the forced-air strategy offers potential for
   further diverse applications in both industrial and scientific fields.},

Title = {An improved direct-forcing immersed boundary method with inward
   retraction of Lagrangian points for simulation of particle-laden flows},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {376},
Pages = {210-227},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The direct-forcing immersed boundary is widely adopted to study
   particle-laden flows. The effective hydrodynamic diameter of the
   particle is much or less overestimated by the original immersed boundary
   method, depending on the particle Reynolds number and grid resolution.
   In this paper, we propose an improved method to dynamically correct the
   effective hydrodynamic diameter by retracting inward the Lagrangian
   points to varying distances. The retraction distance is determined by
   querying a function fitted in this paper. The improved method is tested
   and validated by several cases, including falling of a spherical
   particle under gravity, the uniform flow past two stationary particles
   and the drafting-kissing-tumbling phenomenon of two settling particles.
   It turns out the improved method not only provides better results for
   the drag force but also predicts the flow field more accurately. What's
   more, due to the insensitivity to grid resolution, the improved method
   is suitable for simulating large-scale fluid-particle systems such as
   fluidized bed, which are computationally expensive. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper proposes a technique to reconstitute a lipid bilayer membrane
   by injecting an air bubble onto the raptured spot. Our group has been
   studying the artificial bilayer that can host membrane proteins and can
   be a fundamental to analyze their functions. The only drawback of the
   lipid bilayer formed at the interface of two water-in-oil droplets is
   its sustainability, namely, the bilayer often collapses and the droplets
   merges by the disturbance like self-exerted oscillation or sloshing. To
   overcome this issue, the newly proposed technique utilizes a bubble at
   approximately 4 mu L in volume. When the bubble is injected and
   retracted, the new artificial bilayer is reconstituted. The major
   advantage of this technique is the in-situ reconstitution of the bilayer
   during the electrical measurement of the membrane proteins. The proposed
   technique was successfully verified by confirming the emergence of
   nanopore membrane proteins.},

   outward to grasp an excised specimen and retract it into the center of
   the grasper, which then closes to achieve a secured containment of the
   specimen. Finally, the robot is manually removed from the abdominal

   mechanism to lock the hip angle when the swing leg retracts to a desired
   angle. For this system, an angular momentum based control is presented
   in order to make the biped robot walk on little downhill slope or even
   uphill. Existence conditions of limit cycle under angular momentum based
   control are presented. They can be used to determine whether there
   exists a gait on the slope or not. Furthermore, we apply the method of
   Poincare return map to analyze the stability property of the gait with
   angular momentum based control. Finally, an event-based control is
   adopted to make the walking gait of compass-like biped robot
   asymptotically stable.},

Abstract = {In many industrial gas turbines, a portion of the compressor discharge
   air is extracted through a secondary flow path to aid the cooling of
   critical turbine components as well as to supplement purge flow for
   preventing hot gas ingestion in the first forward turbine bucket wheel
   space. GE has developed advanced brush seals for controlling the amount
   of cooling/purge flow passing through this secondary flow path (also
   called the high pressure packing (HPP) circuit) and has successfully
   implemented them in the field in a variety of E, F \& H class gas
   turbines. During turbine shutdown, due to a lag in thermal response
   between the rotor and the stator interference can result between brush
   seal bristles and the rotor surface causing significant amounts of wear.
   This wear can accumulate over several start up / shut down cycles
   resulting in an increased secondary flow through the HPP circuit and
   thus a loss in turbine efficiency and power output. In order to
   alleviate this situation, a seal holder has been designed to passively
   retract the HPP brush seal, from a low clearance position to a high
   clearance position, during turbine shut down and thus prevent seal
   interference/wear.
   This paper delves into the design and optimization of a retractable
   seal. An analytical model was developed to predict the seal motion
   during startup and shutdown of the turbine. Critical geometry and design
   parameters affecting seal closure and retraction behavior were
   identified. In addition, criteria for stability of seal motion were
   developed and the design was optimized to meet these requirements. Seal
   wear during turbine shutdown is avoided by ensuring that the seal
   retracts faster than the rate of thermally induced interference. The
   effect of design variables was minimized to ensure seal closure and
   retraction behavior does not vary significantly over the operating life
   of the seal. Model predictions were validated by subscale rig tests
   performed in the laboratory.},

Title = {Better guidance is needed for editorial expressions of concern},
Journal = {ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH-ETHICS INTEGRITY AND POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 30},
Abstract = {On occasion, following the publication of a paper, serious concerns
   might be raised, either about the study, the author(s), or background
   processes. When editors-in-chief (EiCs) have sufficient evidence in the
   case of a serious ethical offense or methodological errors that may
   invalidate the paper's findings or ethical standing, they can retract
   the paper rapidly. However, in the interim period between receiving a
   report and seeking a solution, several weeks, months or even years might
   pass, and readers need to be alerted to its potential unreliability. In
   such an instance, the current alternative (but not corrective) document
   takes the form of an editorial expression of concern (EoC). However, a
   case might be unresolved for a long time, with an EoC attached to it, so
   EiCs are encouraged to seek a resolution as promptly as possible because
   there are academics who might need to cite and/or rely on that paper.
   Curiously, even though a comprehensive debate is provided by COPE ethics
   guidelines and ICMJE recommendations, which refer to EoCs, guidance is
   not entirely clear. This paper makes an attempt to improve guidelines
   that editors could consider when faced with the dilemma of whether to
   issue an EoC, or not.},

Abstract = {An improved design of an electrothermally actuated two-terminal bistable
   microswitch is the focus of this paper. The proposed design has bimodal
   bistability which is obtained by using a pair of arches, a V-beam
   electrothermal actuator, and a novel initially retracting actuator. All
   these elements are monolithically integrated in a single planar
   releasable layer. The salient feature of the design is the usage of only
   a single pair of electrodes to switch between ON and OFF states, even
   though there are two actuators. In order to reduce the stress, the two
   actuators are mechanically decoupled but are electrically coupled to
   satisfy the two-terminal actuation. The switch design is experimentally
   verified by realizing on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer using a
   single-layer micro-fabrication technique. An actuation voltage of 11.8 V
   with 200-ms pulse-width, drives the switch from OFF to ON state and a
   50-ms pulse of the same voltage across the same terminals, brings it
   back. {[}2018-0293]},

Abstract = {The cytoskeleton has been suggested to be one of the important
   endogenous factors that control the elaborate morphology of neuronal
   processes. In a previous paper, we showed that overexpression of
   neuronal actin-binding protein, drebrin A, in fibroblasts results in the
   appearance of thick, curving bundles of actin filaments. In this
   chapter, we have analyzed, using a time-lapse recording microscopy
   system, how drebrin-expressing fibroblasts formed highly branching cell
   processes. Because drebrin is a cytoskeletal protein, drebrin in living
   cells could not be immunostained. Therefore, L cells were cotransfected
   with cDNAs of both drebrin A and green fluorescent protein (GFP), and
   drebrin-expressing cells were identified as GFP-positive cells. Their
   cell shape was at first thick and round, seldom bearing any filopodia.
   Then, outgrowth of filopodia-like cell processes suddenly increased,
   apparently because of accumulation of drebrin A. The cell processes of
   drebrin-expressing cells were more stable than normal filopodia and
   seldom retract. Finally, these cell processes changed into long cell
   processes.},

Abstract = {Intracranial extension (ICE) is the spread of tumor into the
   subarachnoid space through dura or along cranial nerve roots. The
   single-stage removal of the skull base tumor with its ICE has been
   confounded by cerebrospinal fluid management and defect reconstruction.
   The purpose of this report is to review a current protocol for managing
   the cranial base tumor and its ICE as a unit. The ventricular shunting
   paper of 19871 is retracted.
   All tumors were managed at a single stage. Defect reconstruction was
   size dependent. Ninety-eight neurotologic skull base tumors with ICE
   were managed from 1971 to 1991. The new protocol was initiated in 1987.
   Results specific to this group are highlighted. For glomus tumors,
   cerebrospinal fluid leak rates have been dramatically reduced overall
   from 14.5\% to 4\%. The leak rates for nonglomus tumors, overall, have
   improved slightly. Complications are discussed.
   The development of this surgical approach protocol improves the
   functional outcome in patients of surgeons who aspire to disease
   ``cure{''} rather than ``control.{''}},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the properties of locally H-closed spaces with
   regard to extensions, subspaces, and functions. We solve the H-closed
   extension remainder problem by showing that a space is locally H-closed
   if and only if it has a theta-closed remainder in some H-closed
   extension. In fact, an H-closed space is Urysohn iff every H-closed
   subspace is theta-closed. We solve the locally H-closed subspace problem
   by giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a subspace of a
   locally H-closed space to be locally H-closed. In particular, an open
   subspace of a locally H-closed space is locally H-closed if and only if
   its boundary is a theta-closed subspace of its closure. An H-closed
   space is shown to be compact if and only if every open subset is locally
   H-closed. A retract of a locally H-closed space is locally H-closed.},

Abstract = {Large information spaces such as the WWW face the problem of how to
   maintain data warehouses (views) defined over Information Sources (ISs)
   whenever capabilities of these ISs change. We have developed a novel
   solution approach to address this problem, called the Evolvable View
   Environment (EVE). In EVE, knowledge of both the capabilities of as well
   as (partial) containment relationships between ISs is collected in a
   Meta Knowledge Base (MKB). The accuracy and consistency of the MKB has
   great importance to the EVE framework, because the MKB serves as an
   information pool enabling EVE to find alternative replacements for
   components of views that have become affected by IS capability changes.
   In this paper, we describe the meta knowledge management problem and
   focus on issues related to the MKB evolution process. The contributions
   of this paper are threefold. In this paper, we first formally define
   consistency criteria for the MKB evolution process. Second, we use PC
   constraint evolution to demonstrate our MKB evolution process. Third, we
   discuss techniques of keeping the MICE as powerful as possible by
   deriving and preserving minimal implicit knowledge from the affected
   explicit meta knowledge, before retracting the latter.},

Abstract = {Rehabilitation treatments applied to a local road prone to terrain

   main objective of this paper was to investigate the effectiveness of
   reinforcement by analysing the amount of produced on the pavement and
   the influence on pavement deflection. It was found that the
   reinforcement retracted the number of cracks, however, did not affect
   the bearing capacity. The influence of the applied geosynthetic was
   manifested in the values of the radius of curvature. The overall
   technical state of the road requires immediate treatment and the applied
   reinforcement proved obsolete because in this particular case of road
   located in the mining active terrain the glass fiber mesh did not

Abstract = {Over the last five decades, philosophers of language have looked into
   the mechanisms for doing things with words. The same attention has not
   been devoted to how toundothose things, once they have been done. This
   paper identifies and examines three strategies to make one's speech acts
   undone-namely, Annulment, Retraction, and Amendment. In annulling an
   act, a speaker brings to light its fatal flaws. Annulment amounts
   torecognizingan act as null, whereas retraction and amendment amount
   tomakingit null. Speakers employ retraction to cancel the deontic
   updates engendered by a given act. They instead use amendment to adjust
   its degree of strength. I will argue thatannulling,retracting,
   andamendingare second-order speech acts, whose felicity conditions vary
   with the type of illocution they operate on. Undoing is therefore
   conceived of as a form of doing. Furthermore, I claim that, in calling
   off our acts, we undo the conventional or illocutionary effects of our
   words while leaving intact their past causal or perlocutionary outcomes.},

   always vastly outnumber the winners); and they change when we retract
   our permission (as Ghandi demonstrated). These vital insights have
   inspired progress down the centuries - the enlightenment philosophers,
   the French Revolution, Tolstoy, the American civil rights movement as
   well as the Indian struggle against the British Empire. In an era when
   widening inequalities have become all too apparent, and the harm this
   does to the commonweal much better understood, this paper argues that La
   Boetie's analysis retains all its power and can inspire a new vision for
   public health. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published

Abstract = {Air-move paths are executed by machine tools to cut 2D patterns that
   must retract (or turn off) when travelling from one pattern to the next.
   These retractions are nonproductive and hence their travelling distances
   should be minimised. For instance, reducing air-move time can increase
   the efficiency of cloth cutting in the garment industry. In this paper,
   a novel algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. In several past
   works, this problem is formulated as an instance of the generalised
   travelling salesman problem. We divide this problem into two independent
   sub-optimal problems (pattern cutting order and entry/exit cutting
   point) and iteratively solve them using a max-min ant system. This
   strategy can greatly narrow down the search space. We also perturb the
   pattern cutting order to avoid dowelling at a local minimum. Experiments
   show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain near-optimal
   solutions, with the results beating the three state-of-the-art
   algorithms that were used as the benchmarks.},

Abstract = {This paper presents experimental results of a reactive deforming path
   algorithm, based on elastic strips, in a 2D / 3D simulator. This
   algorithm generates motion plans that respect global constraints while
   making sure that the robot avoids collisions with all stationary, moving
   and unexpected obstacles. The problem is addressed by integrating a
   global planning algorithm with a local reactive approach. The planner
   performs path planning in two stages: (i) Global planning of the path is
   done using a heuristic search algorithm such as A{*}. (ii) In a dynamic
   environment, with several obstacles moving around in an unpredicted
   fashion, the planner deforms the path reactively by subjecting it to
   artificial forces. For making sure that the robot is always on a
   collision free path, the plan is incrementally updated with changes in
   the environment. The plan representation uses deformable links
   connecting the robot's configurations along the path, stretching or
   retracting the path as required to avoid collisions.},

Abstract = {Every year the number of vehicles on the road is increasing. But there
   are people that start to choose public transport or greener
   transportation options like bicycles or electric cars over typical fuel
   cars. Regarding bicycle usage, the problems that arise are related to
   insufficient bicycle lanes and determination of future lane locations,
   so that the resources used for bicycle lane construction would be
   properly invested. To resolve mentioned problems municipality first need
   to learn where the suitable bicycle lane location for cyclists should
   be. Such a task can be done by applying a cyclist counting system. This
   paper describes a portable automatic cyclist counting system's prototype
   for bicycle lane location planning and also identifies the limitations
   for such a system. Proposed prototype is based on rubber tubes and
   pressure sensors, Wi-Fi module and open source electronic platform
   Arduino. This study is carried out within the ERANet-LAC project RETRACT
   (Enabling resilient urban transportation systems in smart cities).},

Abstract = {The mammalian motor cortex is topographically organized into
   representations of discrete body parts (motor maps). Studies in adult
   rats using long-duration intracortical microstimulation (LD-ICMS) reveal
   that forelimb motor cortex is functionally organized into several
   spatially distinct areas encoding complex, multijoint movement
   sequences: elevate, advance, grasp, and retract. The topographical
   arrangement of complex movements during development and the influence of
   skilled learning are unknown. Here, we determined the emergence and
   topography of complex forelimb movement representations in rats between
   postnatal days (PND) 13 and 60. We further investigated the expression
   of the maps for complex movements under conditions of reduced cortical
   inhibition and whether skilled forelimb motor training could alter their
   developing topography. We report that simple forelimb movements are
   first evoked at PND 25 and are confined to the caudal forelimb area
   (CFA), whereas complex movements first reliably appear at PND 30 and are
   observed in both the caudal and rostral forelimb areas (RFA). During
   development, the topography of complex movement representa-tions
   undergoes reorganization with `grasp' and `elevate' movements
   predominantly observed in the RFA and all four complex movements
   observed in CFA. Under reduced cortical inhibition, simple and complex
   movements were first observed in the CFA on PND 15 and 20, respectively,
   and the topography is altered relative to a saline control. Further,
   skilled motor learning was associated with increases in `grasp' and
   `retract' representations specific to the trained limb. Our results
   demonstrate that early-life motor expe-rience during development can
   modify the topography of complex forelimb movement representations.
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The motor cortex is topographically organized into
   maps of different body parts. We used to think that the function of
   motor cortex was to drive individual muscles, but more recently we have
   learned that it is also organized to make com-plex movements. However,
   the development and plasticity of those complex movements is completely
   unknown. In this paper, the emergence and topography of complex movement
   representation, as well as their plasticity during development, is
   detailed.},

Title = {TWO-SYLLABLE AND THREE-SYLLABLE PREPOSITIONS AS TONIC WORDS IN THE
   LANGUAGE VARIETY SPOKEN IN OSIJEK},
Journal = {JEZIKOSLOVLJE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-92},
Abstract = {One of the widely discussed problems of the orthoepic standard is the
   rule of the accent retraction to the proclitic when the tonic word has a
   descending accent, because in the Croatian standard there is
   inconsistency in relation to the ``(non)obligatory shift of accents and
   the neutrality of such spoken realisations ...{''} (Martinovie 2018).
   Around the middle of the last century, it was observed that in the
   phrase consisting of the proclitic and the tonic word, the accent
   retraction depended on the length of the clitic and that it was more
   often performed when the clitic was shorter. This led to the rule of
   accent retraction in case of one-syllable and two-syllable clitics,
   whereas in words with three or more syllables the accent does not need
   to be retracted. However, this ``adjusted{''} rule was not followed at
   that time and has not been followed since then, not even in the spoken
   language of some native speakers of the New Shtokavian variety. Delag
   (2003) reports that New Shtokavian speakers retract the accent to the
   one-syllable preposition but they do not do so with two-syllable or
   multi-syllable prepositions. Therefore, the problem of accent retraction
   to the proclitic may be viewed not only in regard to the length of the
   tonic word, but also in regard of the length of the proclitic. Although
   the accent realisations of native speakers do not necessarily become
   part of the orthoepic norm, in order for the rule to become established,
   it is important to know the speech habits of as many speakers as
   possible, from different dialectal backgrounds. The paper describes the
   accentuating habits of Osijek residents with special reference to
   expressions in which the accentuated whole is made of a preposition with
   the personal, demonstrative, and reflexive pronoun. Its purpose is to
   establish whether preposition length in these phrases is related to the
   accent retraction to the proclitic.},

Abstract = {The paper presents first positive results of the experiment with
   three-year outdoor cultivation of Cypripedium calceolus L. ex vitro
   seedlings in the Czech Republic. They were propagated in vitro from
   mature seeds of Carpathian provenance in a Prague private laboratory. In
   April 2006 after three months cool refrigerating at 4 degrees C the
   seedlings were prepared for planting. The rhizomes with 4 to 12 roots
   and visible dormant buds were used. They were planted in two types of
   substrates: mixture AN on the basis of liadrain (burned clay pebbles)
   and mixture BN on the basis of granodiorite. Both mixtures were amended
   with perlite, pumice, sand, zeolite and dolomite lime powder. The
   mineral substrates proved to be stable and convenient for transfer and
   cultivation of ex vitro seedlings. Additional treatment with lignohumate
   in other two variants of the experiment did not improve the effect. The
   seedlings were grown outdoors on a shaded bed till the retracting
   leaves. They overwintered in a cold glasshouse with temperature close to
   zero from late November to March. The substrates did not visually
   influence the phase of sprouting, the phase of growth and retracting of
   the plants. At the end of the third growing season the yield of
   4-year-old seedlings with two to four leaves ranged from 83\% to 98\% in
   four variants. In November 2008 seedlings were taken up from the mixes
   and were evaluated as bare root plants. The number of the living plants
   with visible now buds and the quality of root system were recorded and
   evaluated. The average length of roots in mixture A on the basis of
   liadrain and B on the basis of granodiorite was 14.5 cm and 12.1 cm,
   respectively. The rhizomes were planted into new Mixtures immediately.
   These seedlings will be able to grow up to the blooming size during two
   or three seasons. Seven year-old potted seedlings of C. calceolus will
   be planted into gene resource area of the Silva Tarouca Research
   Institute for Landscape and Ornamental Gardening at Pruhonice.},

Abstract = {Paper presents results of numerical and experimental analyses on dynamic
   properties of hydraulic loader crane. Both analyses were carried out in
   two loader cranes configurations first with telescopic boom sections
   partially extended and second fully retracted. Numerical analysis based
   on finite element method was conducted. There were used simplifications
   on hydraulic actuator models, that resulted in reduction of model order.
   Hydraulic actuators were modeled by rod elements with equivalent
   stiffness based on full hydraulic system built in Matlab. Developed
   model included parameters of valves, hydraulic pump and actuators
   itself. The main goal of the research was to develop a simplified model
   of hydraulic loader crane for dynamic analyses. The use of simplified
   models, the results of which are in line with the results obtained in
   experimental studies, allows to shorten the computational time. The
   findings of the presented studies show that, in spite of used
   simplifications, the results of numerical analyses and experimental
   studies are consistent.},

Abstract = {Underwater vehicles such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and
   Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are widely used to collect large
   volumes of data from underwater wireless sensor nodes and networks on
   the surface or in deep ocean. These vehicles are mostly battery-powered
   and charging the on-board batteries of underwater vehicles is considered
   as a challenge. In order to charge the on-board batteries, either power
   is delivered to these vehicles using long cables underwater or drained
   batteries are replaced with charged batteries after retracting the
   underwater vehicles out of water. In this paper, design and evaluation
   of an indigenously designed 1kW Underwater Wireless Charging Station is
   proposed, which enables the underwater vehicles to come near the
   proposed charging station and get charged. In order to evaluate the
   performance of proposed system designed, various experiments are carried
   out and the results are reported. The proposed system can charge
   wireless sensor nodes and networks too.},

Abstract = {With the advent of autonomous vehicles on public roads imminent in the
   near future, special emphasis needs to be placed on addressing scenarios
   pertaining to mixed-traffic settings, comprised of human-driven and
   autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we address the problem of autonomous
   vehicle overtaking in a bidirectional mixed-traffic setting. We design a
   mixed-integer model predictive controller that maximizes the ego
   vehicle's velocity while prioritizing safety and accounting for driver
   comfort. The proposed approach: (i) operates in a limited sensing range
   while accounting for occlusion; (ii) is able to retract the overtake
   decision through a receding horizon approach; (iii) is robust to the
   variations in sensory input and driving behaviors of external agents due
   to behavior-dependent safety margins; and (iv) reduces to a
   mixed-integer optimization problem with linear constraints, yielding low
   computational complexity. We demonstrate the behavior of the proposed
   approach in a realistic traffic simulation environment.},

Abstract = {The impact of Manuka honey dressings on the surface pH of chronic wounds

   International Wound Journal, published online on 20 May 2008 in Wiley

   has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal Editor
   in Chief, Professor Keith Harding, and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. The
   retraction has been agreed due to problems with the analysis of the
   scientific data in Table 1. The regression results presented in this
   table are strongly influenced by a high outlying value (the 16th patient
   in the table). When the results for this patient are omitted, the
   association between initial wound pH and wound size at the end of the
   study is no longer statistically significant (P = 0.132). As this
   relationship is pivotal to the conclusions of the paper, it is felt that
   the interests of patient care would be best served by a retraction.},

Abstract = {This paper proposed a conceptual design of bascule bridge, which is a
   new kind of movable bridge with an aim of reducing the weight of
   superstructure. Compared with the traditional bascule bridge, the light
   bascule bridge chooses cable-stayed bridge with inclined pylon as its
   superstructure; therefore, the functions of balance-weight and structure
   will fuse into one. Otherwise, it adopts moving counterweight to adjust
   its center of gravity (CG) to open or close the bridge. In order to
   lighten the superstructure, it uses contact springs to auxiliary
   retract, and intelligent prestressing system (IPS) to control the main
   girder's deformation. Simultaneously the vibration control scheme of
   structure is discussed. Starting from establishing the mechanical model
   of bridge, this article tries to analyze the conditions that the design
   parameters of structure and attachments should satisfy to. After the
   design procedure was presented, an example was also adopted to explain
   the primary design process of this kind bridge.},

Volume = {19},

Pages = {24-26},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this issue, Beaumont et al report cancer mortality rates associated
   with exposure to high concentrations of hexavalent chromium in well
   water in Liaoning Province, China. Contamination of drinking water at
   these levels has been reported only once before, among a small group in
   Mexico. The investigation in China is a convoluted tale. The first
   report indicated an increase in cancer mortality, while a subsequent
   publication with the same lead author claimed no increased risks. In
   2006, the journal publishing the latter paper retracted it because of
   failure to disclose financial and intellectual input to the paper by
   outside parties (linked to chromium polluting industries). Beaumont and
   his colleagues now provide a further reanalysis of these data, showing
   increased mortality in particular from stomach cancer, but with serious
   limitations in the data and methods of analysis. These limitations are
   counterbalanced by the importance of a study of perhaps the highest
   exposure to hexavalent chromium in water that will ever be experienced
   by a population large enough to estimate risks of cancer.},

   `'T'' takes no advantage of the skin's ability to retract; the second in
   which the scar is a capital `'I'' without a horizontal component takes
   maximal advantage of this characteristic of skin. The results of each
   technique are compared by comparison of two groups of 20 patients, each
   group operated by one technique, and analyzed postoperatively according

Abstract = {This paper presents a framework for detecting objects in images based on
   global features and contours. The first step is a shape matching
   algorithm that uses the background subtraction process. Object detection
   is accomplished by an examination of the oversegmentation of the image,
   where the space of the potential boundary of the object is examined to
   identify boundaries that have a direct resemblance to the prototype of
   the object type to be detected. Our analysis method removes edges using
   bilinear interpolation and reestablishes color sensors as lines and
   retracts background lines from the previous frame. Object contours are
   generated with clustered lines. The objects detected will then be
   recognized using the extraction technique. Here, we analyze the color
   and shape characteristics with which each object is capable of managing
   occlusion and interference. As an extension of object detection and
   recognition, F1 car simulation is experimented with simulation using
   various layers, such as layer drops, convolutionary layers, and boundary
   elimination, avoiding obstacles in different pathways.},

Abstract = {Power-efficient fluidic driven system is beneficial to extending the
   working time of autonomous and wearable soft robots supplied by
   independent power sources such as batteries. In this paper, an energy
   recovery scheme is proposed to reutilize the pressurized air released by
   retracting pneumatic soft actuators instead of venting to atmosphere.
   The scheme's novelty lies in an air accumulator employed to store the
   recovered energy and boost the inlet pressure of air pumps when there is
   requirement. Then the energy-saving principle is described based on the
   comparison of energy flow between the systems with and without energy
   recovery. Residual pressure, recoverable energy and parametric effect
   are also presented analytically according to the ideal gas law. Finally,
   simulation models are developed to evaluate the system performance and
   the results show that about 20\% reduction of power consumption and
   acceptable residual pressure can be achieved simultaneously when the
   accumulator volume is three times of the actuator volume, which provides
   reference to further prototype development.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a prototype of a low-cost Unmanned Surface Vehicle
   (USV) that is operated by wave and solar energy which can be used to
   minimize the cost of ocean data collection. The current prototype is a
   compact USV, with a length of 1.2m that can be deployed and recovered by
   two persons. The design includes an electrically operated winch that can
   be used to retract and lower the underwater unit. Several elements of
   the design make use of additive manufacturing and inexpensive materials.
   The vehicle can be controlled using radio frequency (RF) and a satellite
   communication, through a custom developed web application. Both the
   surface and underwater units were optimized with regard to drag, lift,
   weight, and price by using recommendation of previous research work and
   advanced materials. The USV could be used in water condition monitoring
   by measuring several parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, salinity,
   temperature, and pH.},

Abstract = {Background: Cochlear implant surgery is increasingly being performed
   through a small incision because of the benefits associated with this
   technique, such as fewer wound complications. Efforts have been made to
   maximise surgical exposure in order to improve this evolving technique;
   this includes the development and use of new retractors. For instance,
   elasticated stay hooks can retract skin in a radial fashion and they are
   less bulky than traditional retractors. These hooks are usually attached
   directly to surgical drapes or to a disposable retractor ring; there are
   disadvantages to both of these methods.
   Method: This paper describes a technique using a laryngeal suspension
   bar in which the bar acts as a fixed structure to which these
   elasticated stay hooks can be attached.
   Conclusion: This technique was found to be safer, cheaper and more
   effective for obtaining optimal surgical exposure compared with a
   technique whereby the stay hooks are attached directly to the drapes or
   to a disposable retractor ring.},

Abstract = {Assembly and disassembly verification plays an important role in Product
   Lifecycle Management (PLM). Mass customization and personalized
   production require greater agility of industrial manufacturers, and
   consequently the time consumed in assembly processes (which often
   dominates costs) is of growing importance. Narrow passages which
   commonly exist in assembly tasks become a bottleneck in the assembly
   planning process reducing the time saved by using virtual assembly. In
   this paper, we present a novel interactive motion planning methodology
   for virtual assembly and disassembly operations. In our method, user's
   manipulation with force feedback device in difficult scenario is
   liberated by relaxing collision constraints. The rough path is retracted
   by our random retraction method and then connected by BiRRT algorithm.
   For each user's operation, a path successfully passing through the
   narrow passage is presented, or geometrical interference information in
   failed case is provided for motion re-planning and design modification.
   Significant improvement for trajectory planning of non-convex object is
   observed in challenging 2D scenarios with narrow passages.},

Abstract = {The high thermo-mechanical tool load during cutting of hard-to-cut
   material leads to an increased tool wear, which affects the surface
   integrity and tool life adversely. An innovative approach to counter the
   wear is to retract the tools flank face at a certain distance from the
   cutting edge. The so-called flank face modification geometrically limits
   the tool wear and increases the available material of the tool, which
   can be removed by the abrasive cutting process until a certain tool life
   criterion is reached. However, the flank face modification weakens the
   mechanical stability of the cutting edge. To avoid tool breakage due to
   excessive mechanical stress, this paper presents a new design approach
   based on static finite element simulations. Finally, experimental
   results show an increase in tool life up to 75\% compared to
   conventional tools with these designed modifications (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {We are developing a freight management system that confirms the
   correctness of container handling during shipping. The system determines
   the correctness by comparing container handling, which is sensed by UHF
   RFID tags, with formal models (formulae) written in the Multiple Ambient
   Calculus(MAC). MAC is a formal description language extended from the
   Ambient Calculus(AC) in order to express freight systems with nested
   structures that dynamically change. Using MAC, whole the freight system
   is modeled by a set of formulae each of which represents the handling of
   each container while, using AC, the freight systems are modeled by a
   large formula. Thanks to this feature of MAC, we can express symmetric
   and concurrent property of freight systems more appropriately and adding
   or retracting formulae (representing adding or canceling containers for
   a voyage) becomes easier than using AC. This paper shows the
   implementation of the freight management system and the results of
   several experiments.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many approaches to handle inconsistent knowledge require some
   information to be dropped in order to ensure logical consistency. In
   this paper, a syntax-based technique that simply weakens the conflicting
   information by means of semaphores is proposed and analyzed in the
   context of the fusion of several possibly mutually conflicting knowledge
   sources. The proposed approach basically adopts an unbiased position
   with respect to two knowledge sources in the sense that it does not
   conduct one source to predominate the other one. However marking a
   preference for one source and retracting this preference is easy. When
   the fusion process is iterated, it is shown that semaphores can conduct
   sources to become actually rejected. Conditions preventing such a
   drawback are investigated. It is also shown how this problem can be
   solved when all sources are available simultaneously and how a
   preference for less-contradicted sources can be realized as well. (C)

Abstract = {A satellite in orbit can propel itself by retracting and deploying a
   length of tether, with expenditure of energy but with no use of on-board
   reaction mass, as shown by Landis and Hrach in a previous paper. The
   orbit can be raised, lowered, or the orbital position changed, by
   reaction against the gravitational gradient. Energy is added to or
   removed from the orbit by pumping the tether length in the same way as
   pumping a swing. Examples of tether propulsion in orbit without use of
   reaction mass are discussed, including: (1) using tether extension to
   reposition a satellite in orbit without fuel expenditure by extending a
   mass on the end of a tether; (2) using a tether for eccentricity pumping
   to add energy to the orbit for boosting and orbital transfer; and (3)
   length modulation of a spinning tether to transfer angular momentum
   between the orbit and tether spin, thus allowing changes in orbital
   angular momentum.},

Abstract = {This paper reports new developments and optimizations for clinical use
   of the Steady-Hand Eye Robot for vitreoretinal surgery. Vitreoretinal
   surgery requires precise micromanipulation of delicate tissues. Surgical
   performance is limited by physiological hand tremor, fatigue, poor
   kinesthetic feedback, as well as patient movement. The previously
   developed Steady-Hand Eye Robot has been extensively used in in vivo
   experiments. Several safety and ergonomic limitations observed in the in
   vivo environment serve as motivation for a novel robot wrist design. The
   new robot wrist consists of a symmetric remote center of motion (RCM)
   tilt mechanism and a slim tool holder with a quick release mechanism for
   the surgical instruments. The RCM tilt mechanism provides a tilt motion
   range of +/- 45 degrees and a stiffness of 21 N/mm. Two different
   release force thresholds for the quick release mechanism were designed.
   The soft configuration requires 2-3 N to retract the surgical
   instruments while the hard configuration requires 5-6 N.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a pneumatic gripper that allows gripping of the
   human body aimed for the transfer support, whether the body is lying
   down or leaning against the back support on the chair. To grip the body
   safely and comfortably under any conditions, two functions are newly
   introduced. One of them is ``shape adaptive joints{''} which enable
   every gripping force to be equally distributed at each contact point
   regardless of body shape. The other is ``slip in tip{''} which helps to
   reduce both the risk of injury and the uncomfortable friction between
   the body and the gripper, realized by a new pneumatic actuator to draw
   out the inner chambers without rubbing against the contact surface. It
   allows to bend following to the body shape and can also retract the
   chamber to release the patient safely. The validity of these functions
   are verified by a developed prototype called ``Big-hand{''}, and its
   effectiveness for the transfer support is experimentally confirmed by

Abstract = {In this paper, a flexible in-vessel inspection robot for inspecting the
   first wall inside the vacuum vessel of Experimental Advanced
   Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) is modeled using the absolute nodal
   coordinate formulation. The robot is a macro-micro robot including three
   curved telescopic booms. When the curved telescopic booms are extracted
   and retracted during the operation process, its overall length changes
   dynamically and then the vibration characteristics and deformation is
   timevarying. Since the location of the sliding contact point moves along
   the deformable axis of the flexible boom, it is difficult to derive the
   dynamic model of such robot. To model such robot, the spatial curved
   beam elements of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation for modeling
   the large rotation and deformation is used to model the flexible curved
   booms and the sliding joint constraint of the absolute nodal coordinate
   formulation is used to model the relative sliding motion between the
   flexible curved booms. Finally, the numerical simulation is used to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {In teleoperation and in particular in surgical robotics, it is important
   to avoid getting closer to certain forbidden areas typically limited by
   virtual constraints. In this paper we compare different sensory
   modalities, vibratory, auditory and visual, to convey information about
   constraint violation to the operator. We focus on which of these
   modalities can elicit the fastest reaction time on the user. An
   experiment was devised in which subjects were asked to slowly insert a
   virtual tool by means of a haptic interface, and retract it as soon as
   they hit an obstacle; such event triggered an alert signal. We evaluated
   different signals: auditory, vibrotactile, and visual, with two
   amplitude levels for audio and vibration. Lower reaction times were
   observed on the strong vibrotactile modality, followed by the weak
   vibrations and the loud auditory tone, although the latter was described
   as uncomfortable by the subjects. The vibrotactile feedback was
   described as pleasant by most subjects and appears promising for future
   developments.},

Abstract = {The high-security hospitals of England and Wales are entering a phase of
   major retraction, with local security services embarking upon the
   reprovision of services for patients with longer-term needs who do not
   require high security. The large area mental hospitals underwent similar
   changes and the lessons that may be learnt from this process are
   relevant to proposed changes in forensic services. These lessons
   include: (1) the risk of over-optimistic predictions concerning the
   time-scale and resources required for major bed reduction; (2) the
   problems associated with `creaming off', with the risk of increasing
   acuity in the residual inpatient population accompanied by deterioration
   in the quality of the retracting services; (3) the risk of `silting up'
   in the reprovided services in the absence of an appropriate community
   infrastructure; and (4) the importance of quality of life for
   longer-stay secure inpatients. This paper urges caution in view of the
   potentially serious clinical and organizational risks associated with
   these major changes in forensic services.},

Abstract = {Biceps tendon ruptures can be classified as acute or chronic and can be
   partial or complete. The diagnosis of a complete rupture is a clinical
   one and early surgical reinsertion is usually recommended. Diagnosing
   and treating a partial tear is often more complex. Ultrasound and
   magnetic resonance imaging offer additional information, but it may
   still be difficult to quantify the extent of the tear. Conservative
   treatment is generally recommended for a period of at least 6 months.
   Surgery may be indicated if symptoms persist after this period. As most
   partial tears occur at the interface between the radial tuberosity and
   the tendon, it is impossible to visualize the tear, without retracting
   and potentially further damaging the diseased tendon. Biceps
   tendonoscopy has been described as an option to protect the tendon while
   increasing the view of the insertion. This paper and video (Supplemental
   Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/TSES/A32) will describe the
   technique to safely evaluate and treat the tendon using an
   endoscopically assisted method.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a possible approach to the study of attitude
   maneuvers of a deformable space station equipped with deployable
   tethers. Since the equilibrium attitude depends on the tether lengths,
   it is demonstrated that stable maneuvers can be carried out by deploying
   or retracting the tethers. The equations of motion of the space station
   are derived via the application of the virtual work principle to each
   element of the space station, including tethers. A finite element model
   is used to represent both the tethers and the deformable elements of the
   space station. The latter can be easily inherited from any standard
   finite element code while a special model is developed for the tethers
   in order to specifically include the effects of their variation.
   Numerical simulations are carried out on an abstract model of the space
   station in order to demonstrate the feasibility of stable roll attitude
   maneuvers and to define the range of achievable stable attitudes.},

Abstract = {The Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is identified as the best solution
   for mitigation of voltage sag and swell related problems in the much
   taped distribution system. The compensation performance of the DVR very
   much depends on its control algorithm. In the paper, an estimation
   method based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is proposed for mitigating
   the voltage swell concern. The proposed UKF based estimation technique
   is used to assist the control algorithm for generating reference signals
   of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) of DVR. DVR presents the compensation
   voltage as output which is included in the connected line. With this
   estimation method, voltage swell issues are discovered with accuracy and
   faster performance to retract out the swell problem in sensitivity load
   linked distribution systems. In MATLAB/Simulink platform the suggested
   method is executed and its performance is assessed and contrasted with
   the Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). (C)

Abstract = {Nonmonotonic reasoning is that ability that humans possess which allow
   us to jump to conclusions (which we hope to be reasonable), and then
   later to retract those conclusions when presented with evidence to the
   contrary. As such, nonmonotonic reasoning is a critical feature that
   robust reasoning systems must possess. Negation as failure is the
   principle mechanism that provides logic programs with the ability to
   perform nonmonotonic reasoning. Another important feature that robust
   reasoning systems must possess is the ability to reason about
   collections of objects (i.e., sets). Recent extensions to the semantics
   of logic programs allow us to reason about collections (sets) of
   objects.
   There have been three (and perhaps only three) significant attempts to
   define a semantics for sets as terms in logic programming. These three
   semantics are (in ascending chronological order of invention): LDL,
   (log), and Stable(). This paper examines the nonmonotonicity that these
   three semantics have in common.},

   motion mechanism with a large expanding/retracting radial ratio was
   designed, as was an axial motion mechanism with a compact structure. A
   control system with a special position detector to let the micro-motors
   avoiding stall state was developed to enhance the stability of the
   mechanism and reduce the robot's power requirements. The wireless power
   system enabled the robot to inspect the full length of the intestinal
   tract. The assembled micro-robot was 14 mm in diameter and 45 mm in
   length. The maximum anchoring diameter was 32 mm, and the axial
   telescopic length was 9.5 mm. The test results proved the feasibility of

Abstract = {Emission scan data acquired by a multi-ring PET camera operated with
   septa retracted must be corrected for (1) geometrical and detector
   sensitivity variations between the different lines of response
   (normalisation), (2) photon attenuation, and (3) mispositioned events
   due to photon scattering. These corrections must be applied to the full
   3-D set of lines of response before reconstruction. The standard
   normalisation and attenuation correction procedures for 2-D scans
   increase the statistical noise in the emission scan, a problem which
   becomes even more serious in 3-D because of the large number of LORs
   involved (approximately 8 million). This paper will describe a fully 3-D
   reconstruction algorithm for multi-angle PET data incorporating a
   practical normalisation and attenuation correction procedure which
   minimises the increase in emission scan statistical noise. The
   correction factors are derived from 2-D, septa extended scans. The
   algorithm is currently used to reconstruct 3-D emission data from an
   ECAT 953B, a sixteen-ring PET camera with retractable septa.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel design and reliability assessment simulator
   focusing on HDD (Hard Disk Drive)'s L/UL (Load and Unload) operations.
   The model is structured to incorporate theoretical effects of
   environmental factors, component variations, and temperature effects in
   addition to empirical dependencies on product operating mode. The
   simulator includes detailed model of VCM (Voice Coil Motor), spindle
   motor, PLSI (Power Large Scale Integration), and all other related
   components and their effects on the load and unload operations. The tool
   can be used for feasibility assessment of new electromechanical designs
   and available design margins, and it is also a reliable tool to provide
   accurate tunings for FW (firmware) Load, Unload, Emergency Unload and
   EPOR (Emergency Power Off Retract). The simulator is also capable of
   accurately estimating the potential DPPM (Defective Part Per Million)
   related to the various potential failures using latest statistical
   analysis. The predictions and performance reliability of the model have
   been verified experimentally through comparison with HDD product
   reliability test data.},

Abstract = {Event-B is a formal method for modeling systems based on first order
   logic and set theory, which has gained widespread attention. Software
   safety analysis techniques have played important roles in improving and
   verifying the safety of software intensive systems. Event-B language and
   its tool support can be used for software safety analysis, for systems
   either modeled in Event-B or developed in other ways, in particular for
   safety critical systems. The case study outlined in this paper is aimed
   at applying software safety analysis based on Event-B to a landing gear
   extend and retract system. Firstly, the mechanism of Event-B for
   software safety analysis is discussed, including theorem proving, model
   checking and animation, which are complementary for each other. Then,
   the procedure of safety analysis using Event-B is presented. The case
   study shows that it can provide systematic approaches to identifying
   defects and weak links in software systems.},

Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},

Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Species, through their structure and composition, have evolved to
   respond to environmental constraints. Predator-prey interactions are
   among environmental pressures that can lead to speciation, but it
   remains unclear how this pressure can be related to the material
   structure and performance. Recently, two land snails, Karaftohelix
   editha and Karaftohelix gainesi, were found to exhibit divergent
   phenotypes and responses to predation despite sharing the same habitat
   and most of their genome. Indeed, under attack from a beetle, K. editha
   snails retract into their shell whereas K. gainesi snails swing their
   shell. In this paper, we looked at the microstructure, composition,
   morphology and mechanics of the shells of those two species and discuss
   potential relationships between material structure and the snail defence
   behaviour. The results of this study provide additional arguments for
   the role of predator-prey interactions on speciation, as well as an
   unusual approach for the design of biomimetic structures adapted to a
   particular function.},

Abstract = {High-quality transit service is a vital aspect of any modern city. When
   unexpected interruptions to the transit service occur, they reduce the
   quality of service provided to the public. One of the main strategies
   that is employed to deal with rail service interruptions is ``bus
   bridging,{''} whereby buses from scheduled services are deployed to
   offer shuttle services. Very few efforts are found in the literature
   that have investigated this policy's effectiveness. Therefore, this
   study aims at exploring the different aspects and impacts of retracting
   buses from scheduled services in response to subway and streetcar
   service interruptions in Toronto. It explores the size of the
   deployment, as well as the system response and recovery times using
   detailed subway and streetcar shuttle service reports collected in 2015.
   The paper shows remarkable fluctuations not only in the utilized number
   of shuttle service buses over time, but also on the service response and
   recovery times.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY},

Volume = {195},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The cortical mechanisms that drive the series of mitotic cell shape
   transformations remain elusive. In this paper, we identify two novel
   networks that collectively control the dynamic reorganization of the
   mitotic cortex. We demonstrate that Moesin, an actin/membrane linker,
   integrates these two networks to synergize the cortical forces that
   drive mitotic cell shape transformations. We find that the Pp1-87B
   phosphatase restricts high Moesin activity to early mitosis and
   down-regulates Moesin at the polar cortex, after anaphase onset.
   Overactivation of Moesin at the polar cortex impairs cell elongation and
   thus cytokinesis, whereas a transient recruitment of Moesin is required
   to retract polar blebs that allow cortical relaxation and dissipation of
   intracellular pressure. This fine balance of Moesin activity is further
   adjusted by Skittles and Pten, two enzymes that locally produce
   phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and thereby, regulate Moesin cortical
   association. These complementary pathways provide a spatiotemporal
   framework to explain how the cell cortex is remodeled throughout cell
   division.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) planners drops
   dramatically in spaces with narrow passages. This paper presents a new
   method - small-step retraction - that helps PRM planners rind paths
   through such passages. The method consists of slightly fattening the
   robot's free space, constructing a roadmap in the fattened free space,
   and repairing colliding portions of this roadmap by retracting them out
   of collision. The fattened free space is not explicitly computed.
   Instead, the robot links and/or obstacles are thinned around their
   medial axis. A robot configuration lies in fattened free space if the
   thinned objects do not collide at this configuration. Two repair
   strategies are used. The ``optimist{''} strategy waits until a complete
   path has been found in fattened free space before repairing it. The
   ``pessimist{''} strategy repairs the roadmap as it is being built. The
   former is faster, but the latter is more reliable. A simple combination
   yields an integrated planner that is both fast and reliable.},

Abstract = {In atomic force microscopy, tapping-mode (also called intermittent
   contact mode) operation is known for its ability to image soft materials
   without inducing severe damage. For soft materials, the determination of
   the relative contributions of the topography and the local mechanical
   properties to the recorded image is of primary importance. In this
   paper, we report a systematic comparison between images and
   approach-retract curve data. We show that this experimental comparison
   allows the origin of the contrast that produces the image to be
   straightforwardly evaluated. The method provides an unambiguous
   quantitative measurement of the contribution of the local mechanical
   response to the image. To achieve this goal, experimental results are
   recorded on a model system, a triblock copolymer, with a nanophase
   separation between elastomer and glassy domains. In this particular
   case, we show that most of the contrast in the height and phase images
   is due to variations of the local mechanical properties.},

Title = {Theory of nanobubble formation and induced force in nanochannels},
Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {This paper presents a fundamental theory of nanobubble formation and
   induced force in confined nanochannels. It is shown that nanobubble
   formation between hydrophobic plates can be predicted from their surface
   tension and geometry, with estimated values for the surface free energy
   and the force acting on the plates in good agreement with the results of
   molecular dynamics simulation and experimentation. When a bubble is
   formed between two plates, vertical attractive force and horizontal
   retract force due to the shifted plates are applied to the plates. The
   net force exerted on the plates is not dependent on the distance between
   them. The short-range force between hydrophobic surfaces due to
   hydrophobic interaction appears to correspond to the force estimated by
   our theory. We compared between experimental and theoretical values for
   the binding energy of a molecular motor system to validate our theory.
   The tendency that the binding energy increases as the size of the
   protein increases is consistent with the theory.},

Abstract = {Vehicular Ad hoc Networks adopt the general asymmetric cryptography and
   credential Retraction Records for its safety. In such arrangement, the
   substantiation of a received data is achieved by inspecting if the
   credential of the transmitter is enclosed within the present retraction
   record and certificatory the genuineness of the credential and signature
   of the transmitter. Here, we use an Expedite Message Substantiation
   Protocol for VANET that alternates the long inspecting method by an
   economical retraction inspecting method. Additionally, EMSP uses a
   unique key sharing that allows non-retracted ORUs to firmly share and
   update a secret key. EMSP will efficiently down the data loss
   attributable to the data examination delay compared with the standard
   substantiation ways using. By performing necessary analysis, EMSP is in
   congestible to be safe and economical. In this paper we also propose a
   combination of Expedite Data Substantiation Protocol and Dynamic Source
   Routing protocol for VANETs, which enables efficient routing alternates
   the classical retraction inspecting method by an efficient retraction
   inspecting method.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper I develop a version of contextualism that I call interests
   contextualism. Interests contextualism is the view that the
   truth-conditions of knowledge ascribing and denying sentences are partly
   determined by the ascriber's interests and purposes. It therefore stands
   in opposition to the usual view on which the truth-conditions are partly
   determined by the ascriber's conversational context. I give an argument
   against one particular implementation of the usual view, differentiate
   interests contextualism from other prominent versions of contextualism
   and argue that, unlike those versions, interests contextualism can
   mitigate against the epistemic descent objection put forward by Duncan
   Pritchard in his `Contextualism, Scepticism, and the Problem of
   Epistemic Descent' (the objection is that, on the contextualist view, an
   ascriber of knowledge cannot, for some subject S and proposition p,
   properly ascribe knowledge that p to S if that ascriber has previously
   retracted an earlier ascription of knowledge that p to S).},

Abstract = {Reverse engineering methodology paves an efficient way for simulating

   applications also has shown this approach to be feasible and efficient.
   However, in many applications, a lot of sub-tasks in reverse engineering

   cooperatively over the Internet or Intranet. So, this paper is concerned
   with developing a novel e-service platform for remote service in reverse
   engineering applications based on mobile agent technology, and some
   correlative enabling technologies such as data compression, security
   considerations, agent models and so on. The framework was programmed
   using the Java Sevlets and Java Beans component models, and data
   transferring and processing were implemented based on the
   dispatch/retract mechanisms of mobile agents. The mobile agent is
   developed with IBM's Aglets Workbench, and the feasibility of the
   proposed method has been verified by a case.},

Title = {Accuracy estimation of a stretch-retractable single section continuum
   manipulator based on inverse kinematics},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a novel
   stretch-retractable single section (SRSS) continuum manipulator which
   owns three degrees of freedom and higher motion range in three-dimension
   workspace than regular single continuum manipulator. Moreover, the
   motion accuracy was analyzed based on the kinematic model. In addition,
   the experiments were carried out for validation of the theory.
   Design/methodology/approach A kinematics model of the SRSS continuum
   manipulator is presented for analysis on bending, rotating and
   retracting in its workspace. To discuss the motion accuracy of the SRSS
   continuum manipulator, the dexterity theory was introduced based on the
   decomposing of the Jacobian matrix. In addition, the accuracy of motion
   is estimated based on the inverse kinematics and dexterity theory. To
   verify the presented theory, the motion of free end was tracked by an
   electromagnetic positioning system. According to the comparison of
   experimental value and theoretical analysis, the free end error of SRSS
   continuum manipulator is less than 6.24 per cent in the region with
   favorable dexterity. Findings This paper presents a new
   stretch-retractable continuum manipulator that the structure was
   composed of several springs as the backbone. Thus, the SRSS continuum
   manipulator could own wide motion range depending on its retractable
   structure. Then, the motion accuracy character of the SRSS continuum
   manipulator in the different regions of its workspace was obtained both
   theoretically and experimentally. The results show that the high
   accuracy region distributes in the vicinity of the outer boundary of the
   workspace. The motion accuracy gradually decreases with the motion
   position approaching to the center of its workspace. Research
   limitations/implications - The presented SRSS continuum manipulator owns
   three degrees of freedom. The future work would be focused on the
   two-section structure which will own six degrees of freedom. Practical
   implications - In this study, the SRSS continuum manipulator could be
   extended to six degrees of freedom continuum robot with two sections
   that is less one section than regular six degrees of freedom with three
   single section continuum manipulator. Originality/value The value of
   this study is to propose a SRSS continuum manipulator which owns three
   degrees of freedom and could stretch and retract to expend workspace,
   for which the accuracy in different regions of the workspace was
   analyzed and validated based on the kinematics model and experiments.
   The results could be feasible to plan the motion space of the SRSS
   continuum manipulator for keeping in suitable accuracy region.},

Abstract = {Currently, most tasks submitted to earth observation satellites (EOSs)
   are with deadlines, to satisfy users' timing requirements. Especially,
   in emergency, the timing needs are more apparent. Unfortunately,
   traditional scheduling algorithms do not efficiently deal with this
   issue. Hence, it is nontrivial to propose a real-time scheduling
   algorithm for multiple EOSs. In this paper, we establish a
   multi-objective mathematic programming model for real-time scheduling of
   EOSs. To improve user's revenue and resource utilization, a task dynamic
   merging strategy is proposed. With the dynamic merging in place, plus
   consideration of retracting and rearranging some scheduled tasks to make
   room for incorporating the newly arrived tasks, we present a novel
   real-time scheduling algorithm-DMTRH. To demonstrate the superiority of
   our DMTRH, we conduct extensive experiments by simulations to compare
   DMTRH with two algorithms-RHTSS and STI. The experimental results
   indicate that DMTRH improves the scheduling quality of others and is
   suitable for real-time scheduling.},

   International Journal of Cardiology, I received an email from Professor
   Harold Garner of UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas. Professor
   Garner told me that using a new search engine methodology (eTBLAST) he
   and colleagues had identified a paper in the International Journal of
   Cardiology published in 1996 which had remarkable text and data
   similarity to an earlier paper published in 1992 in the New England
   Journal of Medicine. They had detected this similarity after randomly
   selecting citations from Medline and submitting them to the tool to find
   other highly similar citations as part of their NIH/R01 funded research
   on the ethics of publication. We have been notified that all such cases
   are reported in a database, Deja Vu (http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu/). We
   investigated the text of the two papers and we agreed that there was
   such a similarity that the later paper must have plagiarized the earlier
   paper, and in doing so infringed the copyright. In accordance with our
   previously published standards on ethical publishing in the Journal we
   hereby retract the paper ``The prognostic value of serum troponin T in

Abstract = {This paper is about the definition of CoLan, a high-level declarative
   Constraint Description Language, for use with an Object-Oriented
   Database (OODB). CoLan has features of both first-order logic and
   functional programming and is based on Daplex. CoLan expressions are
   translated into Prolog code that implements the operational semantics of
   the constraint. Pieces of generated code are cached inside the class
   descriptor of the `host' class attached to appropriate slots. The pieces
   of code are retrieved along an inheritance path when an update on the
   database is attempted. If the update violates any of the retrieved
   constaints then it is rejected with an informative message. Thus
   constraints are expressed declaratively and they can even be retracted
   individually. However, they are implemented efficiently as
   code-generated methods, triggered selectively by an update. The
   implementation is described for the ADAM OODB, which uses meta-classes
   of the CoLan system to generate class descriptions.},

Abstract = {In the present paper we introduce and study the Lipschitz retractional
   structure of metric spaces. This topic was motivated by the analogous
   projectional structure of Banach spaces, a topic that has been
   thoroughly investigated. The more general metric setting fits well with
   the currently active theory of Lipschitz free spaces and spaces of
   Lipschitz functions. Among our applications we show that the Lipschitz
   free space F(X) is a Plichko space whenever X is a Plichko Banach space.
   Our main results include two examples of metric spaces. The first one M
   contains two points \{0, 1\} such that no separable subset of M
   containing these points is a Lipschitz retract of M. The second example
   fails the analogous property for arbitrary infinite density. Finally, we
   introduce the metric version of the concept of locally complemented
   Banach subspace, and prove some metric analogues to the linear theory.

Abstract = {The energy sector is going through a large transformation due to public
   demands of renewable energy sources. However, a major issue is that
   these energy sources are intermittent. If designed correctly, district
   heating systems can naturally contain energy storing units, for example
   by storing heat in the isolated pipes that make up the heat grid.
   Additionally, this makes it easier to reuse and transport already
   generated heat to other users. This paper proposes a mathematical model
   of such a grid, where excess energy can be retracted from one user and
   distributed to other users using a network of heat pumps. In some cases,
   one can balance residual heat production with the heat consumption,
   temporarily eliminating the need for a centralized heating plant.
   Existence conditions for stable steady states of such a network with
   general topology are given. Finally, energy optimal stable steady states
   are obtained through convex optimization. Copyright (C) 2019. The

Abstract = {This paper is primarily concerned with the study of conditions on a
   hyperconvex subset D of a hyperconvex metric space M which assure that
   there exists a nonexpansive retraction R of M\textbackslash{}D onto D
   which has the property that R(M\textbackslash{}D) subset of partial

   R proximinal, that is, when does R have the property
   d(x, R(X)) = dist (x, D)
   for each x is an element of M? Among other things, we show that if a
   subset D of a hyperconvex metric space M has nonempty interior and is
   externally hyperconvex relative to M in a very weak sense, then there
   always exists a nonexpansive retraction of M onto D which maps
   M\textbackslash{}D onto partial derivativeD. We also show that any
   compact weakly externally hyperconvex subset of a hyperconvex M is a
   proximinal nonexpansive retract of M. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a `'working'' isolated perfused rat heart. A special
   double cannula was designed consisting of an outer cannula that is
   inserted in the aorta and an inner cannula that is advanced into the
   left ventricle. The perfusion fluid flows through the inner cannula into
   the left ventricle, and is ejected from there into the aorta. If the
   outer cannula system is closed, the fluid perfuses the coronary vessels
   and drips off outside the heart. When the outer cannula is open and
   certain pressure resistance is applied, a fraction of the ejected fluid
   perfuses coronary vessels and the rest is expelled. Because the inner
   cannula can easily be retracted into the outer cannula, which is placed
   in the aorta, this preparation provides an opportunity to use the same
   heart as a `'working'' or `'non-working'' model for investigating
   functions of the heart. The effects of epinephrine and yohimbine were
   tested on this model. This preparation is simple, durable, and reliable.},

Abstract = {Lean premixed flames in an un-confined model swirl burner are studied
   numerically by means of large eddy simulation. In the burner considered,
   swirling flow and a richer pilot flame are used to stabilize the flame.
   The paper investigates the occurrence of the central recirculation zone
   (CRZ) and the precessing vortex core (PVC) for two variants of the
   burner, as well as the flame response to a sinusoidal variation of the
   mass flow rate in the pilot jet. The corresponding isothermal swirling
   flows are also simulated for providing reference. Detailed comparisons
   with experimental data are performed for velocity statistics and
   generally good agreement is achieved. Additionally, coherent structures
   are analyzed and local power spectra computed. It is found that a very
   strong PVC is observed in numerical results and experiment for the
   non-reactive case with retracted pilot jet. In the reactive cases where
   the whole CRZ is enclosed in the high-temperature post-flame region, the
   PVC is almost completely suppressed.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of the effects of particles on

   Drops laden with polystyrene particles coated with calcium phosphate are
   observed to behave differently from pure liquids, especially on thermal
   oxide coated silicon wafer, which is the most hydrophilic surface
   studied. It was found that pure fluid viscosity is more important than
   apparent viscosity of the particle-laden fluid in setting the spreading

   the Teflon(R) surface depends on particle volume fraction.},

Journal = {ROCKY MOUNTAIN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Singular compactifications of locally compact Hausdorff spaces were
   first introduced over a decade ago. An elegant characterization of
   singular compactifications is the following: A compactification alpha X
   of the locally compact Hausdorff space X is singular if and only if
   alpha X\textbackslash{}X is a retract of alpha X. In this paper we
   provide a new representation of singular compactifications. It has been
   previously shown that the supremum of singular compactifications need
   not itself be a singular compactification. Examples of this fact are
   easy to find. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions which
   describe when the supremum of a family of singular compactifications is
   a singular compactification. We also show that there are
   compactifications which are not the supremum of a family of singular
   compactifications. For two singular functions f and g such that S(f) is
   homeomorphic to S(g) we describe conditions which show when X boolean
   ORf S(f) is equivalent to X boolean ORg S(g).},

Abstract = {This paper presents a nanoindentation study of MgO(100) crystals by
   experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. The MgO crystals are Ar+
   irradiated up to a fluence of 10(20) Ar+/m(2). The materials are
   compared both before and after irradiation by nanoindentation confirming
   an increase in hardness but not in the indentation modulus with
   increasing dose. The experimental and simulation results also indicate
   that radiation induced defect pinning decreases the dislocation mobility
   to increase hardness and to cause the material to become less brittle.
   Molecular dynamic simulation studies confirm the experimental
   observation for non-irradiated magnesia of pop-in events and slip
   occurring in the (1 1 0) planes which can result in pile up patterns
   after indentation which are dependent on crystal orientation. The slip
   systems can cause the injection of half planes into the upper layers,
   that often retract after tip removal. This feature can be attributed to
   the formation and partial recombination of nanocracks. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {One of the main issues about logic-oriented knowledge fusion concerns
   the way contradictory information should be handled. Many syntax-based
   approaches require some information to be dropped in case of logical
   inconsistency. On the contrary, the technique described in the paper
   simply weakens some information to overcome inconsistency. A family of
   fusion approaches is presented, encompassing various inconsistency
   handling policies. They basically adopt an unbiased position with
   respect to two knowledge sources in the sense that they do not make one
   source predominate the other one. However, enforcing a preference for
   one source and retracting this preference is easy. When the fusion
   process is iterated, it is shown that the approaches can lead sources to
   be rejected. Conditions preventing such a drawback are investigated. It
   is also shown how this problem can be solved when all sources are
   available simultaneously. Finally, a preference for less-contradicted
   sources is characterized in this framework.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on the results of a three-dimensional ultrasound
   study of Polish vowels in consonant-vowel sequences. It was found that
   allophonic variation in vowels in the context of ``soft{''} consonants
   is consistently implemented phonetically by means of tongue root
   advancement, which effectively expands the pharyngeal cavity and reduces
   the volume of the oral cavity. The tongue root is also consistently
   advanced in the soft consonants that trigger vowel allophony and
   retracted (or neutral) in the ``hard{''} sounds, which do not trigger
   allophony, suggesting that tongue root advancement is part of the
   phonological representation of the ``softness{''} (or palatalization)
   contrast. In parallel to this allophony, the same tongue root mechanism
   was found to underlie the phonotactic distribution of the phonemic
   vowels /i/ and /O/, yielding an entirely symmetric system with
   consonant-vowel sequences always obligatorily compatible in terms of the
   position of the tongue root. (C) 2019 Acoustical Society of America.},

Abstract = {The equivalent circuit method can be an effective modelling technique
   for system studies of point absorbing wave energy converters (WECs). For
   the continuously evolving design and study of WEC systems, an
   instruction on how to draw the corresponding equivalent RLC circuit
   model is needed. It is not only vital to make sure the model is correct,
   but to allow the model to be easily adapted for different cases and
   implemented by different researchers. This paper presents a force
   analysis-oriented methodology based on a typical WEC unit composed of a
   heaving buoy and a linear generator. Three cases are studied in order to
   demonstrate the procedures: the generator with a retracting spring, the
   connection line with a rubber damper, and buoy motion in both heave and
   surge directions. The presented methodology serves as a guide to produce
   nonlinear circuit models that give a reliable description of the
   dynamics of real wave energy systems.},

Abstract = {The Steam Generator of the PFBR is a vertical heat exchanger with sodium
   flowing in the shell side, and water in tube side. The tubes have an
   expansion bend to accommodate the thermal expansions and periodic
   in-service inspection is to be carried out to check the reduction in
   tube wall thickness and crack using Eddy Current Probes. Cable Pusher
   Module is used to insert and retract the probe in to the tube having 23
   meter length. This paper presents the detailed design and development of
   CPM which includes the control system, software and mechanical aspects.
   CPM transmits the parameters like odometer reading, slip, velocity and
   time of inspection through serial interface. Graphical User Interface is
   developed using VB 6.0 Compiler for data logging. Slip of the motor is
   plotted for the tube length and this suggests an optimum design for the

Abstract = {Biologists are protesting a decision by the editors of the journal
   ``Cell{''} to retract a paper without the authors' assent or any
   allegations of misconduct. In July 2004, a group at the University of
   Brasilia published a widely noted paper claiming that experiments in
   chickens and rabbits showed that the parasite,Trypanosoma cruzi,
   responsible for Chagas disease, actually transfers DNA to the host
   genome. They also reported that parasitic DNA integrated into DNA of
   patients with heart damage from the disease. The unexpected finding
   offered a possible way to explain why the disease, prevalent in Latin
   America, can damage a person's organs decades after the parasite is
   gone. In June, ``Cell{''} editorEmilie Marcus wrote the research team,
   headed by Antonio Teixeira of the Chagas Disease Multidisciplinary
   Research Laboratory, that ``subsequent re-analyzes{''} by a reviewer she
   did not name ``do not support the claim{''} of DNA integration. Although
   the Brazilian team offered detailed rebuttals, Cell published a
   one-paragraph retraction in the 23 September issue. The retraction has
   generated a flurry of indignant correspondence, including a protest
   letter from the Brazilian Society of Protozoology. Cell editors have so
   far remained silent.},

Title = {On the periphery of midwifery: A critical analysis of a community-based

Journal = {HUMAN ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},

Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {The incidence of invasive cervical cancer in Mexico is believed to be
   among the highest in the world even though a national screening program
   has been in effect for over 30 years. As the Mexican government
   struggles to overcome obstacles in delivering cancer screening services,
   civil society groups are working towards increasing the acceptability
   and accessibility of Pap exams among marginal populations. This paper
   examines a community-based program initiated by the Morelos Women's
   Center (CMM), which trains traditional midwives to conduct Pap exams in
   rural communities. The study considers how the CMM seeks to address the
   cultural and structural obstacles that women face in public clinics as
   the national government retracts health services under neoliberal
   reforms. Drawing attention to the disjunctures that emerge as
   traditional midwives with little formal education are trained to carry
   out a biomedical program, the paper raises questions regarding how
   effectively community organizations can fill in the gaps left by a
   declining health system. The case suggests that micro-analyses of
   community health efforts are essential for identifying the potentials
   and limitations of civil society organizations as they increasingly take
   on responsibilities in health care planning, promotion, and
   distribution.},

Abstract = {The paper is aimed at proving the following: for a triangulated category
   (C) under bar and E subset of Obj (C) under bar, there exists a
   cohomological functor F (with values in some Abelian category) such that
   E is its set of zeros if (and only if) E is closed with respect to
   retracts and extensions (so, a certain Nullstellensatz is obtained for
   functors of this type). Moreover, if (C) under bar is an R-linear
   category (where R is a commutative ring), this is also equivalent to the
   existence of an R-linear functor F : (C) under bar (oop) -> R-mod with
   this property. As a corollary, it is proved that an object Y belongs to
   the corresponding ``envelope{''} of some D subset of Obj (C) under bar
   whenever the same is true for the images of Y and D in all the
   categories (C) under barp obtained from (C) under bar via ``localizing
   the coefficients{''} at maximal ideals p sic R. Moreover, certain new
   methods are developed for relating triangulated categories to their
   (nonfull) countable triangulated subcategories.
   The results of this paper can be applied to weight structures and
   triangulated categories of motives.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a flying-wing tail-sitter aircraft which can
   switch between vertical flight mode (rotary-wing mode) and level flight
   mode (fixed-wing mode). Equipped with two propellers and two elevons,
   the aircraft can fly by controlling these four actuators. The aircraft
   uses a microcomputer and various sensors to stabilize the attitude and
   to switch modes on command. Using the transition logic, it can receive
   and act on the signal sent by operator at any time, whether it is to
   switch modes or to retract the command. Using the target angle
   calculation algorithm, the aircraft can adjust its pitch angle during
   transition. PID feedback is used for attitude control both in vertical
   mode and during the transition. Test results show that the aircraft have
   the advantages of helicopters and fix-wing airplanes. It can hover
   midair and does not need runway to take off, and it can fly in high
   speed in fixed-wing mode.},

Abstract = {This paper describes an architecture for dynamically handling spatial
   relations in an incremental, nonmonotonic diagrammatic reasoning system.
   The architecture represents jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint
   (JEPD) spatial relation sets as nodes in a dependency network. These
   spatial relation sets include interval relations, relative orientation
   relations, and connectivity relations, but in theory could include any
   JEPD spatial relation sets. This network then caches dependencies
   between low-level spatial relations, allowing those relations to be
   easily assumed or retracted as visual elements are added or removed from
   a diagram. For example, in the architecture's Undo mechanism, the
   dependency network can quickly reactivate cached spatial relations when
   a previously-deleted element is restored. As part of this work, we
   describe how the system supports higher-level reasoning, including
   support for creating default assumptions. We also describe how this
   system was integrated with an existing drawing program and discuss its
   possible use in diagrammatic and geographic reasoning.},

Abstract = {Doublets of Onychodromus acuminatus develop from cysts of two cells
   encysted together (Jareno 1977). This kind of cyst is composed of plasma
   membrane, common cytoplasm and two sets of nuclei and is protected by a
   well-developed cyst wall. During excystment this spherical and
   undifferentiated cell is transformed into a complex and polarized
   organism that has a binary axis of symmetry. The two macronuclei stretch
   forming sharp points that reach the cortex. Two primordia of ciliature
   are organized early and two synchronized morphogenetical processes lead
   to formation of the doublet. When cortical morphogenesis is almost
   finished the points of the macronuclei retract.The changes of the
   macronuclei throughout the development of the doublets have been
   studied. This paper describes, for the first time in ciliates, the
   behavior of the double set of macronuclei at both light microscope, and
   ultrastructural levels and shows that these events are correlated with
   the formation of bundles of fibers and the development of cortical
   morphogenesis of doublets.},

Abstract = {Citations in a scientific paper reference other studies and form the
   information backbone of that paper. If cited literature is valid and
   non-retracted, an analysis of citations can offer unique perspectives
   about the supportive or contradictory nature of a statement. Yet, such
   analyses are still limited by the relative lack of access to open
   citation data. The creation of open citation databases (OCDs) allows for
   data analysts, bibliometric specialists, and other academics interested
   in such topics to independently verify the validity and accuracy of a
   citation. Since the strength of an individual's curriculum vitae can be
   based on, and assessed by, metrics (citation counts, altmetric mentions,
   journal ranks, etc.), there is interest in appreciating citation
   networks and their link to research performance. Open citations would
   thus not only benefit career, funding, and employment initiatives, but
   they could also be used to reveal citation rings, abusive author-author
   or journal-journal citation strategies, or to detect false or erroneous
   citations. OCDs should be open to the public, and publishers have a
   moral responsibility of releasing citation data for free use and
   academic exploration. Some challenges remain, including long-term
   funding, and data and information security.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the development of a semi-automated friction stir
   welding (FSW) technique for joining 38 mm nominal outer diameter (OD)
   tubes of 6082-T6 aluminium alloy with 3.5 mm nominal wall thickness. The
   technique incorporates a retracting tool in order to avoid leaving a
   substantial hole in the joint line after extracting the tool at the end
   of the welding process. This is one of very first applications of FSW to
   small diameter tubular geometries to be reported in the open literature
   and the technique is capable of producing small-scale production runs
   (circa 100) of welded tube specimens with consistent tensile and fatigue
   properties. The tensile strength of the extruded 6082-T6 tube was 303
   MPa while the joint efficiency of the weld was 0.55 both for complete
   tube specimens and for microtensile specimens. This compares well with
   values reported in the literature for 3 mm flat plate specimens of 6082
   alloy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   TRANSACTION BRACKETS INTO A LOGIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE},
Journal = {LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {474},
Pages = {1-10},
Abstract = {The integration of logic programming and databases has up to now
   focussed on read access of logic programs to external databases storing
   permanent data. However, the integration of write operations modifying
   existing databases would allow to use logic programming languages in a
   much larger field of applications. Therefore, it is important that the
   logic programming language not only embeds modification operations on
   existing databases, but also embeds transactions in order to preserve
   the correctness of the modified database.
   This paper describes an integration of database modifications and
   transactions into a logic programming language evaluated by a depth
   first left to right strategy with backtracking. We propose a semantics
   of insert and delete operations and outline why these operations are
   defined different from assert and retract in Prolog. Furthermore, we
   propose a semantics for transaction brackets and describe how these
   operations differ from begin-transaction and end-transaction statements
   in database programming languages.},

Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {193},
Pages = {731-743},

Abstract = {This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) design for the test
   mass release phase of the LISA space mission. LISA is a gravitational
   wave observatory consisting of a triangular constellation of three
   spacecraft. The gravitational waves are detected by measuring the
   relative distance between free falling test masses by means of a laser
   interferometer. Each test mass is a cubic body located inside an
   electrostatic suspension that is initially locked by a clamp mechanism.
   Once the plungers are retracted, the test masses are released with high
   initial offsets and velocities. To detect the gravitational waves, each
   test mass must be accurately positioned at the cage centre and its
   attitude must be aligned with the local cage frame. However, the low
   actuation authority of the electrostatic suspension along with the
   critical initial conditions, make the attitude and translation control a
   difficult task. MPC is a suitable technique for this application because
   it can systematically account for command saturations, state constraints
   and can provide optimal (or sub-optimal) control inputs by solving an
   optimization problem online. In this paper, an MPC controller is
   designed and validated by means of Monte Carlo simulations, achieving
   satisfactory results.},

Abstract = {The above article, published online on 17(th) July 2014 in Wiley Online
   Library (), has been retracted by agreement between the authors, the
   journal Editor in Chief, Professor J. McGrath and John Wiley \& Sons
   Limited. The retraction has been agreed owing to duplication of some
   images. In this paper, a series of adjacent sections from each group
   were stained using immunohistochemical and histological methods, and the
   authors obtained a large number of photographs from each group. When
   selecting representative images from each group, some photographs
   obtained from differently treated groups were inadvertently mixed up.
   Incorrect photographs were used in this paper as follows: (1) the
   photographs shown in Figure 7A and B are overlapping images from the
   same section; (2) the photographs shown in Figure 10a and c, and in
   Figure 10b and d are overlapping images from the same tissue slices. In
   addition, because the authors failed to identify correctly the damaged
   neurons with Nissl staining, the same neurons that are intact in the
   sham-operated group are reported to be damaged in the BCCAO group with
   treatment. Thus, this may have caused the incorrect number of the intact
   neurons obtained from each group.},

Abstract = {The genus Morchella has gone through turbulent taxonomic treatments.
   Although significant progress in Morchella systematics has been achieved
   in the past decade, several problems remain unresolved and taxonomy in
   the genus is still in flux. In late 2019, a paper published in the
   open-access journal Scientific Reports raised serious concerns about the
   taxonomic stability of the genus, but also about the future of academic
   publishing. The paper, entitled ``High diversity of Morchella and a
   novel lineage of the esculenta clade from the north Qinling Mountains
   revealed by GCPSR-based study{''} by Phanpadith and colleagues, suffered
   from gross methodological errors, included false results and artifactual
   phylogenies, had misapplied citations throughout, and proposed a new
   species name invalidly. Although the paper was eventually retracted by
   Scientific Reports in 2021, the fact that such an overtly flawed and
   scientifically unsound paper was published in a high-ranked Q1 journal
   raises alarming questions about quality controls and safekeeping
   procedures in scholarly publishing. Using this paper as a case study, we
   provide a critical review on the pitfalls of Morchella systematics
   followed by a series of recommendations for the delimitation of species,
   description of taxa, and ultimately for a sustainable taxonomy in
   Morchella. Problems and loopholes in the academic publishing system are
   also identified and discussed, and additional quality controls in the
   pre- and post-publication stages are proposed.},

Title = {Frauds in scientific research and how to possibly overcome them},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS},
Year = {2021},

Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Frauds and misconduct have been common in the history of science. Recent
   events connected to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted how the risks
   and consequences of this are no longer acceptable. Two papers,
   addressing the treatment of COVID-19, have been published in two of the
   most prestigious medical journals; the authors declared to have analysed
   electronic health records from a private corporation, which apparently
   collected data of tens of thousands of patients, coming from hundreds of
   hospitals. Both papers have been retracted a few weeks later. When such
   events happen, the confidence of the population in scientific research
   is likely to be weakened. This paper highlights how the current system
   endangers the reliability of scientific research, and the very
   foundations of the trust system on which modern healthcare is based.
   Having shed light on the dangers of a system without appropriate
   monitoring, the proposed analysis suggests to strengthen the existing
   journal policies and improve the research process using new technologies
   supporting control activities by public authorities. Among these
   solutions, we mention the promising aspects of the blockchain technology
   which seems a promising solution to avoid the repetition of the mistakes
   linked to the recent and past history of research.},

Title = {Degenerate discontinuity-induced bifurcations in tapping-mode

Journal = {PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {239},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper documents the existence of degenerate bifurcation scenarios
   in the low-contact-velocity dynamics during tapping-mode atomic-force
   microscopy. Specifically, numerical analysis of a model of the
   microscope dynamics shows branch point and isola bifurcations associated
   with the emergence of two families of saddle-node bifurcation points
   along a branch of low-amplitude oscillations. The paper argues for the
   origin of the degenerate bifurcations in the existence of a periodic
   steady-state trajectory that (i) achieves tangential contact with a
   discontinuity surface in a piecewise smooth model of the cantilever
   response and (ii) retracts from the surface under variations in either
   direction along a line segment in parameter space. Specifically, the
   discontinuity-mapping technique is here rigorously applied to a general
   situation of such degenerate contact showing the codimension-two nature
   of these bifurcations for appropriately chosen parameter values. The
   discontinuity-mapping-based normal form derived here is a novel
   extension of that derived in Dankowicz and Nordmark (2000) {[}28] in the
   case that (ii) does not hold. In addition, the paper includes a
   quantitative reflection on the relative importance of discontinuities in
   the attractive and repulsive force components in producing the predicted
   bifurcations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Surviving through the kindness of strangers: can there be
   ``wellbeing{''} among undocumented refugee children?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE STUDIES ON HEALTH AND WELL-BEING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Purpose: The paper exames notions of health and wellbeing in the context
   of radically retracted rights to political asylum. It questions the
   tendency in previous research to regard the political economy of refugee
   protection as a parallel issue to a range of factors affecting
   children's health.
   Methods: Based on ethnographic research with 19 undocumented refugee
   children in Sweden, the paper illustrates ways in which the deportation
   regime conditions participants' health.
   Results: Findings show that children lived with precarious status for
   the better part of their childhoods, alternating between undocumented
   and asylum seeking statuses. Participants accessed formal rights to
   education and health through complete or relative strangers at risk of
   exposure to authorities. The paper argues that conceptualisations of
   refugee children's suffering in terms of risk and protective factors are
   redundant in this context. Moreover, deportability, protracted refugee
   situations and deprived material conditions are not unique to
   undocumented refugees, but characterise most refugee children's lives in
   welfare states today.
   Conclusion: In relation to the plight of the refugee child, wellbeing
   seems to refer to an abstract ontology of desirable states of the human
   experience, far removed from the real day-to-day lives of individuals
   shaped by social suffering and structural violence.},

Abstract = {An article published in 1998 by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet (volume
   351, pages 637-641) led to concerns surrounding the safety of the
   measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, by associating it with an increased
   risk of autism. The paper was later retracted after multiple
   epidemiological studies failed to find any association, but a
   substantial decrease in UK vaccination rates was observed in the years
   following publication. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal
   Bayesian hierarchical model with accompanying software (the R package
   CARBayesST) to simultaneously address three key epidemiological
   questions about vaccination rates: (i) what impact did the controversy
   have on the overall temporal trend in vaccination rates in Scotland;
   (ii) did the magnitude of the spatial inequality in measles
   susceptibility in Scotland increase due to the measles, mumps and
   rubella vaccination scare; and (iii) are there any covariate effects,
   such as deprivation, that impacted on measles susceptibility in
   Scotland. The efficacy of the model is tested by simulation, before
   being applied to measles susceptibility data in Scotland among a series
   of cohorts of children who were aged 2.5-4.5, in September of the years
   1998 to 2014.},

Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS \& APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {100},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This is a correction of a recent paper in which we studied several
   classes of differential equations by means of a modified fixed point
   theorem of Krasnoselskii. The modification was based on a fixed point
   theorem which reduced the conditions of Schauder's theorem for such
   problems so that it became very close to Brouwer's fixed point theorem.
   That theorem concerned a self-mapping of a closed bounded convex
   nonempty subset, M, of the Banach space of bounded continuous functions
   with the supremum norm. The theorem was overstated in that it should
   have required that M be a ball in the space or a certain retract. Thus,
   each of the fixed point theorems offered in this paper being now
   corrected should require that M be a ball. The error causes one direct
   problem here. In a theorem on p. 131 we added to the set M the condition
   that the functions all tend to zero at 8 and, consequently, claim that
   the fixed point tends to zero. That is false; the most we can say is
   that it is a bounded continuous function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a massive
   rise in survey-based research. The paucity of perspicuous guidelines for
   conducting surveys may pose a challenge to the conduct of ethical, valid
   and meticulous research. The aim of this paper is to guide authors
   aiming to publish in scholarly journals regarding the methods and means
   to carry out surveys for valid outcomes. The paper outlines the various
   aspects, from planning, execution and dissemination of surveys followed
   by the data analysis and choosing target journals. While providing a
   comprehensive understanding of the scenarios most conducive to carrying
   out a survey, the role of ethical approval, survey validation and pilot
   testing, this brief delves deeper into the survey designs, methods of
   dissemination, the ways to secure and maintain data anonymity, the
   various analytical approaches, the reporting techniques and the process
   of choosing the appropriate journal. Further, the authors analyze
   retracted survey-based studies and the reasons for the same. This review
   article intends to guide authors to improve the quality of survey-based
   research by describing the essential tools and means to do the same with
   the hope to improve the utility of such studies.},

   times from notification of concerns to EoC (10.4mo) or retraction
   without EoC (13.1mo) were similar. Among the 95 EoCs, 29 (30.5\%) were
   followed by retraction after a median of 5.4mo, none was lifted, and 66
   (69.5\%) remained in place after a median of 18.1mo. Publishers with >10
   notified publications issued EoCs for 0-81.8\% of papers: for several
   publishers the proportions of notified papers for which EoCs were issued
   varied considerably between the 2 research groups. EoCs were issued for
   >30\% of notified publications of randomized clinical trials and letters
   to the editor, and <20\% of other types of research. These results
   demonstrate inconsistent application of EoCs between and within
   publishers, and prolonged times to issue and resolve EoCs.},

   interferon induction and rhinovirus control in human cystic fibrosis
   airway epithelial cells. Thorax 2012;67:517-25. This article has been
   retracted. In our article recently published in Thorax, we described a
   novel mechanism explaining the increased susceptibility of patients with
   cystic fibrosis (CF) to rhinovirus infections, namely defective
   interferon type I and III production by CF airway epithelial cells. In
   experiments performed after publication of the article we were unable to
   consistently replicate our findings of deficient interferon type I and
   III production by CF airway epithelial cells upon rhinovirus infection.
   In the light of these results, we carried out detailed investigations of
   the data reported in the above manuscript and regrettably found evidence
   of deliberate manipulation of experimental data by the first author Dr
   M. Vareille. This manipulation was accompanied in some instances by
   absence of original data files. The manipulation/original data absence
   involved data presented in most, if not all of the figures, thus we wish
   to fully retract the paper and apologise to the readers of Thorax and to
   the scientific community for the inconvenience this has caused. We also
   checked data published by our group in manuscripts on which Dr Vareille
   was a co-author and found that data published in these manuscripts had
   not been manipulated. These two manuscripts, whose data and conclusions
   we stand by are: Edwards MR, Regamey N, Vareille M, et al. Impaired

Abstract = {The pipediameter of tubular textile composite material applied in
   Pipeline Rehabilitation is a very important parameter. If the
   pipediameter is too big, the tubular textile composite material lined in
   the pipeline will produce many creases, then the flow rate of the medium
   will be affected; or if the pipediameter is too small, the inversion
   ends and the pressure is withdrawn, before the resin is solidified, the
   tubular textile composite material will retract, then it will fall off
   from the wall of the pipeline. The paper introduced the principle of
   design, the elasticity and hot shrinkage property of the tubular textile
   composite material as the key infection parameters were submitted, the
   strain in circle direction was analyzed by the finite element when the
   tubular textile composite material was being inversed, then the paper
   made a conclusion that depending on the elasticity of the tubular
   textile composite material the design data of the pipediameter can be
   adjusted; the hot shrinkage property was analyzed by software of SPSS,
   the model that affected the relationship between hot shrinkage and
   temperature, time was established, so this work can guide the
   pipediameter design of the tubular textile composite material.},

Journal = {AIP ADVANCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of black holes in anti-de
   Sitter space-time. We focus our attention on the hyperbolic black holes
   with less acceleration horizons and their topology. By using a
   Lagrangian formalism, we deduce the equatorial geodesics on the line
   element of these objects. Furthermore, the phenomenon of deformation
   that can retract space-time is considered. The results are extended to
   n-dimensional hyperbolic black holes assuming the end limit of folding
   in 0-dimensional objects. We also take into account the initial
   conditions in view of studying the relation between the limit folding
   and the limit retraction. This relation is of particular importance in
   the space-time morphology and dynamics of black holes and their
   interaction with other self-gravitating systems due to tidal forces.
   This can also be observed in the formation of galaxies and the early
   phase of the universe at large scale structures. The commutative
   diagrams have also been obtained to figure out the relation between the
   retraction and folding of a hyperbolic black hole.},

Abstract = {Backgrounds: This paper describes an additional benefit in double
   anterior segmental osteotomy to correct severe anterior protrusion in
   adult patients with extremely thin mandibular alveolus and ankylosed
   tooth. For the optimal anterior segmental retraction, an ankylosed
   posterior tooth needed surgical inclination reposition. During anterior
   segmental osteotomy surgery under local anesthesia, additional single
   tooth osteotomy was performed without challenge.
   Methods: For anterior segment retraction, osteotomy cuts were made by
   the surgeon to define a block of bone embedding 6 mandibular anterior
   teeth. First premolars were extracted during initial orthodontic
   treatment period. But the ankylosed lower left lateral incisor and lower
   right second premolar root which remains mesially with uprighted crown
   hindered further anterior segment retraction. The authors removed
   cortical bone around second premolar root and repositioned to be
   upright. Anterior segment was retracted to proper position utilizing the
   space gained.
   Result: Thin alveolar mandibular anterior segment retraction and the
   second premolar uprighting were managed effectively with additional
   single tooth segmental osteotomy during anterior segmental osteotomy.
   Conclusion: Double anterior segmental osteotomy can be an effective
   alternative to conventional orthognathic surgery in selected adult
   patients.},

Abstract = {This paper replicates the results of the survey of experienced
   executives reported in Section IV of Seybert (2010). The survey data
   from the originally published article were retracted due to concerns
   about the source of the data (see Seybert 2015). I survey 79 experienced
   executives to elicit their beliefs about reputation-driven real earnings
   management. Participants indicate that a manager would be more likely to
   continue a failing project, and that project abandonment would have a
   greater negative impact on the manager's reputation concerns and future
   prospects at the firm, when R\&D is capitalized. Consistent with capital
   market pressures identified in prior research, executives believe that
   abandoning a failing project would have a greater negative impact on
   stock price when R\&D is capitalized, and they personally recommend
   continuing such a project in order to avoid missing the consensus
   analysts' forecast. These findings complement the experimental results
   in Seybert (2010), and while they replicate the survey results contained
   therein, they are not an endorsement of the veracity of the original
   survey data.},

Abstract = {A deployable mechanism is a mechanism that is designed to be repeatedly
   expanded and contracted without failure. Most deployable mechanisms are
   over-constrained mechanisms with a mobility of one. Although many
   deployable mechanisms had been proposed and employed in application in
   the past decades, few generalized methodologies for the synthesis of
   both planar and spatial deployable mechanisms are available. In this
   paper, a systematic methodology, based on the Cardanic motion of planar
   linkage, for the synthesis of both the spatial and planar deployable
   mechanisms is presented. By using the characteristics that some of the
   coupler points of Cardanic linkages are able to move along a straight
   line, a building unit mechanism that utilizes such a linkage can be
   extended or retracted as desired. Once the boundary conditions of the
   building unit mechanisms are obtained, design of an entire deployable
   mechanism, planar or spatial, can be fulfilled. After the design is
   achieved, motion of the synthesized mechanism is simulated in
   Pro/Engineer, and the prototype of a planar model is manufactured for
   the justification of this method.},

Title = {On confluently graph-like compacta},
Journal = {FUNDAMENTA MATHEMATICAE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {178},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-127},
Abstract = {For any class K of compacta and any compactum X we say that: (a) X is
   confluently K-representable if X is homeomorphic to the inverse limit of
   an inverse sequence of members of K with confluent bonding mappings, and
   (b) X is confluently K-like provided that X admits, for every epsilon >
   0, a confluent epsilon-mapping onto a member of K. The symbol LC stands
   for the class of all locally connected compacta. It is proved in this
   paper that for each compactum X and each family IC of graphs, X is
   confluently K-representable if and only if X is confluently K-like. We
   also show that for any compactum the properties of: (1) being
   confluently graph-representable, and (2) being 1-dimensional and

Abstract = {The Landing Gear System for the X-38 demonstration vehicle has been
   developed considering future application to the CRV vehicle. It consists
   of three legs in a typical aeroplane configuration with two main and one
   nose legs. They are retracted during ascent, in orbit and re-entry
   phases and are released near the ground by pyrotechnic-nuts and deployed
   by preloaded springs and gravity. This gear has been designed to allow
   landing in unprepared plain fields limiting the accelerations on the
   spacecraft at touch down, through expendable damping cartridges and
   skids.
   During 2002 the test campaign of the X-38 Landing Gear has been
   completed at Sener. Three different types of tests have been performed:
   Functional deployment tests, Static load tests and vibration tests. This
   paper discusses the objectives of the tests and how they are achieved
   with a description of the mechanisms involved and their predicted
   performances.
   The different types of tests and results are described together with the
   major events and lessons learned during their performance.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a more detailed description of normal tongue palate
   contact patterns for the occlusion phase of velar stops than currently
   exists. The study used electropalatography (EPG) to record seven
   normally speaking adults' contact patterns of voiceless velar stops in
   nine VkV contexts. A variety of EPG indices measured: per cent complete
   closures across the palate; place of articulation; articulatory distance
   between /k/ and /t/; and amount of contact. Complete EPG closure
   occurred in the majority (81\%) of tokens. Some speakers almost always
   had complete closures regardless of context, whereas other speakers
   produced them only with high front vowels. As expected, place of
   articulation and amount of contact were heavily influenced by vowel
   context. The most fronted and most contact occurred in /i/ contexts and
   the most retracted and least contact in /a/ contexts. There was
   considerable interspeaker variability on all measures, particularly in
   the precise location of velar placement and articulatory distance
   between alveolar and velar placement. The implications for diagnosing
   and treating abnormal velar articulations are discussed.},

Abstract = {Plagiarism, the use of text and ideas from published works without
   proper permission or citation, is difficult to detect since the whole
   text should be searched and compared to literature databases.
   Nevertheless, this process has become simpler with the advent of
   web-based technologies and more powerful search tools. Recently, a case
   of plagiarism was detected in an invited manuscript submitted to the
   Journal of the Korean Medical Association. In the withdrawn manuscript,
   there were figures and figure legends copied from other papers with
   neither permission nor citation. Only the citation is enough to use
   content, figures, or tables from other papers when the original journal
   is open access with Creative Commons License. Otherwise, to use such
   data, it is essential to obtain permission from that paper's journal
   publisher. If plagiarism is detected after publication, the author will
   face harsh disciplinary action before the office of research integrity
   in his or her institute. Also, the paper may be retracted by the editor.
   This is the first time that Editorial Board has detected plagiarism
   before publication. Screening for plagiarism and other ethical
   violations will continue so that we can pursue the status of the
   representative journal of Korean physicians and develop a positive
   reputation for Korean science internationally by maintaining the utmost

Abstract = {The paper contributed to the literature of COVID-19 in the Philippines

   There were 56 videos selected from 30 January to 30 May 2020 using the
   technique of Browsing, Linking, Shortlisting, and Focusing (BLSF). The
   results of the study showed that: (1) Filipino language was the medium
   of messaging at the height of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ); (2)
   spectrogram images revealed a monotonic voice, which was criticized in
   social media; (3) theme of positivity was prevalent in describing the
   responses of government during a crisis; (4) discourse strategies like
   excessive usage of inclusive pronoun {[}natin], retracting the official
   statement, downplaying the significant COVID-related updates, and
   blaming the ordinary citizens were utilized to handle the deficiencies
   of government in managing the early phase of the pandemic. For further

Abstract = {Hydraulic reciprocating seals are dynamic sealing elements used in
   hydraulic actuators that play a very important role in preventing
   leakage. In this paper, a multisensor monitoring scheme including Fiber
   Bragg Grating sensors, fluid pressure sensors, and reciprocating
   displacement sensor was designed to analyze the leakage of hydraulic
   cylinder in a complete reciprocating work cycle. A complete hydraulic
   cylinder reciprocating cycle includes the extending process of piston
   rod, the full extension of piston rod, the retracting process of piston
   rod, and the full retraction of piston rod. Through an especially
   designed test bench, multisensor monitoring data were obtained under
   different wear degree of the piston seals. The analysis results show
   that there will be a ``pull-back effect{''} in the return stroke of the
   piston seal. Therefore, leakage-based monitoring methods used in
   existing studies may not accurately reflect the wear of piston seals. If
   it is desired to detect wear of the piston seal during its actual
   operation, the contact pressure of the piston seal must be monitored.
   The paper also discusses the wear feature extraction method and how to
   deal with multiple features extracted from multisensor monitoring
   signals.},

Abstract = {Within this work, a system for remote powering of small-scale hovering
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is developed, aiming to achieve
   prolonged-endurance flight times in order to address possible civilian
   applications with such requirements. To this purpose, the key-concept of
   a Power-over-Tether system is proposed, with the power bank for the
   UAV's operation located on the ground, and power transferred via a
   tethering cable. In order for the UAV to be capable of executing
   hovering trajectories as freely as possible, a long power cable is wound
   onto a custom-developed base, which is capable of releasing and
   retracting it when necessary. The Power-over-Tether system base is
   developed to operate autonomously, locally sensing when the aerial
   vehicle requires additional length of free cable to move to its intended
   goal, or when excessive cable length requires retraction, and performs
   the respective actions. The complete implementation of the system, both
   hardware and control-wise is elaborated in detail within the scope of
   this paper. Additionally, experimental evaluation studies are conducted,
   demonstrating the potential of the proposed Power-over-Tether system.},

Abstract = {We outline the Brave system: a Horn-clause language Brave, a dialect of
   Prolog designed for OR-parallel execution, plus meta-Brave, containing
   extra-logical features. Brave has been stripped of Prolog's cut, assert
   and retract, enforcing a declarative programming style which enables
   easier parallelisation. However, we need replacements for those
   predicates, in particular to code parallel versions of search
   algorithms, where guidance of the search in one subtree requires
   information from another subtree. Meta-Brave features directives which
   allow algorithmic knowledge about the domain to be stated independently
   from die Brave application program.  This guidance is provided in three
   main ways: partial results are selectively remembered (lemmas),
   conditions of early failure of subproofs are stated (pruning), the style
   of search is altered (strategies). We show how this combination of
   features makes the Brave system specially suited to writing clear
   programs, for example search algorithms taken from Artificial
   Intelligence. In this paper we investigate how OR-parallelism can be
   exploited in hill-climbing, genetic algorithms and best-first search. By
   simulation we analyse the parallelism obtained.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to reconstruct the palaeohydrological changes in Corral
   Grande (Antofagasta de la Sierra Department, Catamarca Province,
   Argentina), relating the formation and growth of a paleowetland with the
   hydrological balance in the high catchment area. This study provides,

   To this end, geomorphology, sedimentology, and microfossil (diatoms)
   analyses as well as radiocarbon datings were carried out in the
   confluence of Mojones and Los Nacimientos streams. Results indicate that
   between ca. 2000-1800 BP the rivers were permanent and the floodplains,
   where the Formative occupation occurred, had organic soils and a shallow
   water table. Between ca. 1800 and 300 BP the paleowetlands were eroded
   and/or were covered by sediments associated with debris flows. This
   environment was sometimes contemporary with the occupation of the Late
   Inca Period, and the settlements were located in geoforms away from the
   paleowetland. Later, between ca. 300 and 240 BP, the Mojones river
   developed new, but less extensive, paleowetlands, and were shortly after
   deteriorated and retracted upstream.},

Abstract = {Breast neoplasm may develop in ectopically located glandular tissue.
   This paper presents an interesting and rare case of a 50-year-old female
   who despite regular mammography screening examination developed an
   invasive accessory breast cancer. Clinical examination revealed a 2 cm -
   tumour localized 4 cm below the left inframammary fold. The lesion was
   immobile, the skin and the atrophic nipple were retracted, the tumour
   infiltrated the thoracic wall. Oligobiopsy and additional examinations
   showed an invasive stage IIIB ductal breast cancer (Bloom II, G-2). The
   receptor status was: ER(+), PGR(+), HER2(-). The increased level of
   cancer antigen 15.3 was found. The patient was submitted to
   pre-operative chemotherapy. She also underwent surgery and subsequently
   post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
   On the basis of the presented case, it could be concluded that the
   accessory mammary glands are out of the image of screening breast
   examinations. Accessory breast cancer is usually diagnosed by clinical
   examination and ultrasonography. Preventive resection of accessory
   breast in women at high risk of developing breast cancer can be
   considered as the treatment of choice in most patients.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we deal with the problem of computing the digital
   fundamental group of a closed k-surface by using various properties of
   both a (simple) closed k-surface and a digital covering map. To be
   specific, let SCkin1,li be a simple closed k(i)-curve with l(i) elements
   in Z(ni), i epsilon \{1, 21\}. Then, the Cartesian product SCn(k1)(1,l1)
   x SCk2n2,l2 C Z(1)(2)(n)(+n) is not always a closed k-surface with some
   k-adjacency of Z(n1+n2). Thus, we provide a condition for SCk1n1,l1 x
   SCk2n2,l2 to be a (simple) closed k-surface with some k-adjacency
   depending on the ki-adjacency, i C f 1, 21. Besides, even if SCk x
   SC,,{''}{''} is not a closed k-surface, we show that the k-fundamental
   group of SCk1n1,l1 x SCn(k2)(2,l2) can be calculated by both a
   k-homotopic thinning and a strong k-deformation retract. (C) 2007

   al., (Cancer Biother Radiopharm epub 19 Aug 2020; DOI:

   published paper.
   The Editor of the journal received an email on August 31, 2020 from the
   corresponding author of the article, Dr. Chuan Qin, indicating that,
   `'due to our negligence in organizing the pictures, the protein pictures
   are repeatedly placed in Figure 7G PI3K. For this, we express our
   sincerest apologies. We need to {[}issue] an {[}erratum] on this issue.
   We have replaced the protein picture of Figure 7G with the correct
   picture.'' However, one of the attachments submitted with the request
   appeared to be the original version of Figure 7 from the accepted
   manuscript. A second attachment appeared to be the data from three
   replicates to be used (by the journal) to construct a revised version of
   Figure 7. The Editor, in turn, informed the authors that it was not at
   the journal's discretion to create a new image for them, and asked the
   authors to create the revised figure and supply it to the publisher.
   Below is the response from Dr. Qin, dated September 2, 2020.
   ``In fact, our team's Western blot experiment commissioned a third-party
   company for testing. At present, some peers have found that the company
   has forged experimental reports. We believe that the authenticity of the
   data provided by the company is problematic. After contacting the
   company, they were unable to provide the original images. In view of the
   problems in this manuscript, all the authors discussed and agreed to
   withdraw the manuscript.{''}
   As the entirety of the situation is unacceptable, the Editor officially
   retracts the article based on the ``forged experimental reports{''} and
   the questionable validity of the data provided.
   The Editor and Publisher of Cancer Biotherapy and Radiopharmaceuticals
   is dedicated to preserving the integrity of the scientific literature

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Deployability of reciprocal frame (RF) structures can aid in the
   creation of multifunctional architectures, satisfy the needs of flexible
   architectures, and adapt to climatic and environmental conditions.
   However, changes in the perimeter of a structure during deployed and
   retracted states may result in low efficiency in architectural design
   and limit its architectural applications. The purpose of the present
   study was to investigate the geometric feasibility of deployable kinetic
   reciprocal frame (KRF) structures with constant perimeters and fixed
   support points. This structure can cover constant perimeter without any
   change while adapting, particularly providing many potential benefits in
   architectural applications and bridging the gap between two states. The
   research methodology used in this paper is a design-based examination of
   the geometry of fixed RF structures. The study's findings revealed a
   wide range of KRF structures that can cover various geometric plans
   using moving elements along a specific path on adjacent elements and
   rotating them in fixed supports on the outer polygon without modifying
   the perimeter during deployment or retraction. (C) 2022 American Society

Abstract = {At present, with the acceleration of the pace of life and the increase
   of work pressure, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are
   getting closer and closer to people. In recent years, vascular
   interventional surgery has developed into an important method for the
   treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However,
   traditional interventional surgery has extremely strict requirements for
   doctors, and doctors who perform interventional operations for a long
   time will suffer a lot of radiation. Using vascular Interventional
   surgery robots to assist doctors in surgery ran make up for many
   shortcomings of traditional surgical procedures. Therefore, the market
   has the demand for surgical robots which is becoming more and more
   urgent. Based on the previous research of the research team, this paper
   proposes a vascular interventional surgery robot system with a bionic
   clamp. The robot uses a gear slider structure to push and retract the
   guide wire catheter. Its clamp is mainly used to clamp and twist the
   catheter and guide wire, and adopts a portable design, and finally
   realizes the rapid replacement of the catheter and guide wire.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEMANTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-82},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper centers on discourses where instead of accepting or rejecting
   an assertion, a hearer uses an epistemic possibility claim to bring a
   new subject matter to the original speaker's attention and consequently
   leads this speaker to change her mind and retract the initial claim. To
   analyze such resistance moves, we develop a new theory of
   attention-shift-induced belief change in which attention is modeled
   using granularity-levels or resolutions of logical space and refining a
   speaker's attention can allow her to combine more of her
   resolution-sensitive information and potentially change her beliefs. We
   integrate this theory into pre-existing machinery from the literature on
   formal models of discourse to account for both the informational and
   attentional dynamics in epistemic resistance discourses, and to lay out
   some of the formal prerequisites for a more comprehensive theory of
   resistance moves in general. Along the way, we introduce the new concept
   of a subject matter under public attention (SUP) and compare this with
   the more familiar concept of a question under discussion (QUD).},

Journal = {MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {92},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To develop a new type of deployable/retractable mechanism, the joint
   friction effect is considered in this paper. Several types of mechanisms
   with self-lock and unlock functions are presented as design units. These
   units can be constructed in parallel, in series, or in both ways to form
   a type of large deployable mechanisms. The self-locking and unlocking
   conditions of the designed units are analysed, and a new type of
   deployable mechanism, which can be extended and retracted along a
   straight line, is designed with the proposed unit constructing method.
   The relationship between the unit constraint matrices at various
   configurations is presented. During the moving process, the topology
   structure of the deployable mechanism is variable, including changes of
   the joint direction and the joint number. A cable driving prototype with
   only one motor is built, and relevant simulations are conducted to
   verify the design method. The results demonstrate that the joint units
   perform perfectly and that a larger dimension deployable mechanism can
   be established. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of automatic skill acquisition by a
   robot. It reports that six trials of a reach-grasp-release-retract skill
   are sufficient for learning a canonical description of the task under
   the following circumstances: The robot is Robonaut, NASA's
   space-capable, dexterous humanoid. Robonaut was teleoperated by a person
   using full immersion Virtual Reality technology that transforms the
   operator's arm and hand motions into those of the robot. The operator's
   sole source of real-time feedback was visual. During the six trials all
   of the Robot's sensory inputs and motor control parameters were recorded
   as time-series. Later the time-series from each trial was partitioned
   into the same number of episodes as a function of changes in the motor
   parameter sequence. The episodes were time normalized and averaged
   across trials The resultant motor parameter sequence and sensor signals
   were used to control the robot without the teleoperator. The robot was
   able to perform the task autonomously with robot starting positions and
   object locations both similar to, and different from the original
   trials.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the development of a strategy to stabilize a
   Planar Vertical TakeOff and Landing Aerial Vehicle powered by a tether
   system. The tether system consists of a ground station which provides
   power through a suspended cable to the aerial vehicle. Giving a position
   reference, the ground station computes the optimal cable length
   reference, which minimizes the tension force acting on the vehicle due
   to the cable weight. The optimal cable length is commanded by an
   automatic winch that retracts/releases the cable forming a catenary
   curve shape between the ground station and the aerial vehicle. This
   automatic procedure allows to reduce the disturbances in the vehicle
   since over-tensions in the cable are avoided. We used a state feedback
   controller with a tension compensator to control the vehicle altitude as
   well as its horizontal position, while the vehicle attitude and the
   winch dynamics are controlled by local state feedback controllers.
   Finally, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   strategy we conducted simulation tests.},

Abstract = {In robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery, the first assistant (FA)
   stands at the bedside assisting the intervention, while the surgeon sits
   at the console teleoperating the robot. Tasks for the FA include
   navigating new instruments into the surgeon's field-of-view and passing
   in or retracting materials from the body using hand-held tools. We
   previously developed ARssist, an augmented reality application based on
   an optical see-through head-mounted display, to aid the FA. In this
   paper, we refine the system and first perform a pilot study with three
   experienced surgeons for two specific tasks. instrument insertion and
   tool manipulation. The results suggest that ARssist would be especially
   useful for less experienced assistants and for difficult hand-eye
   configurations. We then perform a multi-user study with inexperienced
   subjects. The results show that ARssist can reduce navigation time by
   34.57\%, enhance insertion path consistency by 41.74\%, reduce
   root-mean-square path deviation by 40.04\%, and reduce tool manipulation
   time by 72.25\%. Thus, ARssist has the potential to improve efficiency,
   safety and hand-eye coordination, especially for novice assistants.},

Abstract = {Direct deposition of graphene on substrates would avoid costly, time
   consuming and defect inducing transfer techniques. In this paper we used
   ultrathin films of Ni, with thickness ranging from 5 to 50 nm, as a
   catalytic surface on glass to seed and promote chemical vapor deposition
   (CVD) of graphene. Different regimes and dynamics were studied for
   various parameters including temperature and reaction time. When a
   critical temperature (700 degrees C) was reached, Ni films retracted and
   holes formed that are open to the glass surface, where graphene
   deposited. After CVD, the residual Ni could be etched away and the glass
   substrate with graphene regained maximum transparency (>90\%). The fact
   that we could achieve low growth temperatures indicates the potential of
   the technique to widen the range of substrate materials over which
   graphene can be directly deposited. We demonstrated this by depositing
   graphene patterns on ultrathin, 100 mu m thick, sheet of glass with low
   strain point (670 degrees C), particularly suitable for flexible
   electronic and optoelectronic devices. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Abstract = {Net winch is a major fishing net equipment for retracting and pulling
   fishing nets. Currently, the multi-drum net winch is widely used in the
   ocean going seiners. It is mainly based on the tensile load and velocity
   to design the net winch drum drive device and drum numbers. The
   structure includes a main frame, drive drums, reduction gear box, gears,
   hydraulic motor, the base etc. In order to meet the demand of ``Le
   ting{''} seiner, which is fishing in Mauritania and other West African
   waters, the four-drum net winch was designed based on the friction belt
   drive principle, a multi-drum drive model and three-dimensional
   simulation model of four-drum net winch was constructed, and prototype
   model was manufactured. Through the load test, the results show that
   tension of the net exit measured by the test is approximately equal to
   that of the theoretical calculation, and meet the design requirements.
   This design of four-drum net winch in this paper provides an important
   reference for designing the same type of seine net winch.},

Abstract = {The condition of a grinding wheel surface has a major effect on the
   surface quality and integrity of the finished component. The condition
   of the grinding wheel is constantly changing during the process of
   grinding. Self-dressing is one feature of this process, and blunting and
   wearing of the cutting grits are other undesirable outcomes. The wear of
   grits and falling out of sharp cutting edges have serious effects on the
   ground component integrity and surface finish. This can happen to all
   types of grinding wheels. This paper presents a novel automated system
   for dressing of all types of grinding wheels. This system can detect in
   process the condition of the wheel surface, order a dresser to move to
   the grinding wheel and dress it to the desired condition under the
   control of the system and then retract to its original position. This is
   done without any operator interference. Hence, the system can be readily
   used with CNC grinders. The system was designed to provide a highly
   accurate and controllable dressing condition.},

   Northeastern Mandarin (NEM), and Southwestern Mandarin (SWM), using

   speakers and 4 SWM speakers in their twenties were analyzed and
   discussed. Our recording materials include the dental and retroflex
   apical vowels, and their er-suffixed forms. Results suggest that
   distinct lingual configurations are found among the three dialects of
   Mandarin, even though these apical vowels are not perceptually
   distinguishable. Specifically, the dental apical vowel {[}.] has a
   grooved tongue shape in BJM, a retracted tongue dorsum in NEM, and a
   relatively flat tongue shape in SWM. The retroflex apical vowel {[}.]
   has a domed tongue shape as well as a bunched tongue body in NEM, while
   a slightly domed tongue posture is found in SWM. Moreover, the retroflex
   apical vowel {[}.] is, articulatorily speaking, very similar to the
   er-suffix in BJM (cf. {[}10]). In sum, we observed yet another instance
   of the articulatory-acoustic mismatch.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the deployment dynamic analysis of antennas mainly
   composing of deployable truss and cable net. The antennas are deployed
   by retracting driving cables, which pass through pulleys fixed on the

   lengths of the cable segment between two adjacent pulleys are selected
   as the generalized coordinates. This model could simulate the dynamics
   of the driving cables with time-varying length. Then, the flexible
   multibody dynamic model of the deployable antenna including the flexible
   deployable truss and cable net is established. The absolute nodal
   coordinate formulation is employed to model the flexible deformation of
   the truss and the tension of the cable net. The method is demonstrated
   by analyzing the deployment of a cylindrical mesh antenna. The
   deployment experiment of the antenna shows that the proposed method can
   correctly predict the driving force and length variation of the driving
   cables, the bending deformation of the flexible truss, and the
   deployment process.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to comprehend identification of Socioeconomic
   Vulnerability Indicators - IVSB, and Urban Infrastructure ones - IVIU,
   from Caico city. Collected information made possible identification of
   association between these vulnerabilities and how occurrence of both
   affects city dwellers; besides these data will also serve like subsidies
   for planning future public politics. Methodologically, this work is
   based on bibliographic and document research. Thus, Caico's
   socioeconomic vulnerability cartography reveals that indexes and levels
   related to this phenomenon do not present great variations, situating
   between medium and very low. IVIU obtained average index of 0.188 and
   was classified in very unsatisfactory level, denoting lack of urban
   equipments and service offering. Thus, realized study evidences almost
   non-existence of association between indicators and levels of IVSB and
   IVIU. In developed analysis, It was evident that city does not suffer
   serious consequences related to socioeconomic vulnerability and,
   contrary, urban infrastructure vulnerability present worrisome results,
   retracting lack of urban goods and services, because of that
   vulnerability condition under which considerable fraction of local
   population is submitted.},

Journal = {PHYSICAL REVIEW E},

Volume = {96},

Abstract = {A human pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), moves on surfaces by
   attaching and retracting polymeric structures called Type IV pili. The
   tug-of-war between the pili results in a two-dimensional stochastic
   motion called twitching motility. In this paper, with the help of
   real-time NG trajectories, we develop coarse-grained models for their
   description. The fractal properties of these trajectories are determined
   and their influence on first passage time and formation of bacterial
   microcolonies is studied. Our main observations are as follows: (i) NG
   performs a fast ballistic walk on small time scales and a slow diffusive
   walk over long time scales with a long crossover region; (ii) there
   exists a characteristic persistent length l(p){*} , which yields the
   fastest growth of bacterial aggregates or biofilms. Our simulations
   reveal that l(p){*} similar to L-0.6, where L x L is the surface on
   which the bacteria move; (iii) the morphologies have distinct fractal
   characteristics as a consequence of the ballistic and diffusive motion
   of the constituting bacteria.},

Abstract = {Post-operative haemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of
   castrations in stallions. It is considered as one of the most frequent
   complications. Bleeding from the testicular artery may be caused by
   insufficient crushing and/or ligation of the artery, or by loosening of
   the ligature. The bleeding artery may be approached through the scrotal
   wound, or through an incision at the level of the external inguinal
   ring. However, sometimes the spermatic cord has retracted into the
   abdomen which may make localisation of the spermatic stump rather
   difficult and requires general anesthesia. General anaesthesia is not
   without risk in these patients as their cardiovascular status may be
   severly compromised by heavy blood loss. In recent years laparoscopy has
   been successfully introduced for many indications in equine surgery.
   Laparoscopic procedures can be carried out in the standing, sedated and
   locally anaesthetised horse, without necessity for general anaesthesia.
   In this paper two cases are presented in which laparoscopic techniques
   were used for the treatment of post-operative haemorrhages in two
   castrated stallions.},

Title = {3-DIMENSIONAL MOTION PLANNING IN AN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT FOR ROBOT ARM
   MANIPULATORS WITH REVOLUTE OR SLIDING JOINTS},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS \& AUTOMATION},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {188-198},
Abstract = {The existing work on nonheuristic motion planning of robot arm
   manipulators in unknown environments covers mostly various
   two-dimensional (2D) cases. Extending the algorithms to
   three-dimensional (3D) cases is important from both a theoretical and ar
   engineering standpoint. In this paper a motion-planning strategy is
   presented for a class of three-link robot arm manipulators operating in
   an unknown 2D or 3D environment. The joints of the robot arm manipulator
   can be either revolute or prismatic (sliding). Out of eight possible
   combinations of kinematic linkages, the approach applies to those four
   combinations for which the third joint is sliding. This covers the
   majority of arm manipulators used in practice. The authors show that the
   tree configuration space of such a robot arm has a 2D deformation
   retract that allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the
   motion-planning problem. Existing theory of motion planning is then
   extended appropriately, producing powerful algorithms that guarantee
   collision-free motion for the robot arm's whole body in a 3D environment
   with unknown obstacles of arbitrary shape.},

Title = {Mechanistic Analysis and Bio-inspired Applications for a Bidirectional
   Stiffness of a Water Snail Operculum},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIONIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 31},
Abstract = {The water snail Pomacea canaliculata retracts the discoidal and
   multi-layered operculum to protect the soft body from being attacked by
   predators, and releases it when threats lifted. However, the duration of
   the operculum retraction is usually less than that of the operculum
   protraction. In this paper, we elucidate the biological compliant
   mechanism of the operculum. By using confocal laser scanning microscopy,
   we find that the operculum has compliant sandwiched layers between hard
   layers. The layered structure results in a compliant mechanism with a
   bidirectional stiffness for the locking and unlocking processes of the
   operculum. A mathematical model is derived to rationalize the
   bidirectional stiffness mechanism of the operculum. In addition, we
   carry out the experiments on the locking and unlocking processes. The
   experimental results show that the locking tension is about two-fifths
   of the unlocking tension of the operculum. Moreover, based on the
   mechanical properties of the operculum with the layered structure, we
   designed an operculum-inspired structure, which may have a variety of
   potential applications in combined driving patterns.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world; people are living
   differently in all aspects: the ways they are socializing, buying, or
   even thinking before doing something, have led to dramatic
   transformations in different types of business. Some companies are
   thriving while others are struggling to stay alive, restructuring their
   products management and services. Many workers fear for their
   livelihoods and still working even not being paid. Consumers, in
   general, tend to retract non-essential purchases but on the other hand
   they have learned to adapt quickly to overcome the constraints imposed
   by governments. They also started working from home at the same time
   their younger children started taking online classes. Suddenly our home
   became our world, the place where we study, build, eat, do sports, and
   share our fears and our hopes. So, if we all stay there longer, what
   does your wardrobe look like?
   The purpose of this paper is to gather as much information as possible
   to understand how the enclosure experiences have transformed people's
   ways of dressing.},

Abstract = {The winding system has a long travel range, often reaching several
   meters or even hundreds of meters. Conventional long-range displacement
   measuring methods have a large measurement error and are difficult to
   realize bidirectional measuring. An innovative long-range automatic
   displacement measuring method and device of winding system is proposed
   and designed, which uses double timing belt transmission pairs as
   precise clamping conveyer. By analyzing the displacement error of linear
   transmission caused by the polygon effect of trapezoid tooth and
   circular arc tooth, this paper proposes to use circular arc tooth timing
   belt to reduce the measurement error. Double rotary encoders are used to
   measure the displacement simultaneously, which can effectively reduce
   the measurement error caused by the slippage of the timing belt
   transmission. The proposed method and device has been used successfully
   in cable displacement measurement of trailing cone automatic retracting
   and releasing system for air static pressure measurement in aircraft
   test flight. The experimental results show that the proposed method is
   correct and feasible, and the displacement measurement error is less
   than 0.5\%.},

Abstract = {The digitization and related developments in journal editing and
   publishing necessitate increasing the awareness of all stakeholders of
   science communication in the emerging global problems and possible
   solutions. Journal editors and publishers are frequently encountered
   with the fast-growing problems of authorship, conflicts of interest,
   peer review, research misconduct, unethical citations, and inappropriate
   journal impact metrics. While the number of erroneous and unethical
   research papers and wasteful, or `predatory', journals is increasing
   exponentially, responsible editors are urged to `clean' the literature
   by correcting or retracting related articles. Indexers are advised to
   implement measures for accepting truly influential and ethical journals
   and delisting sources with predatory publishing practices. Updating
   knowledge and skills of authors, editors and publishers, developing and
   endorsing recommendations of global editorial associations, and (re)
   drafting journal instructions can be viewed as potential tools for
   improving ethics of academic journals. The aim of this Statement is to
   increase awareness of all stakeholders of science communication of the
   emerging ethical issues in journal editing and publishing and initiate a
   campaign of upgrading and enforcing related journal instructions.},

Abstract = {Undeployment of an L.G.M.(R) percutaneous vena cava filter is rare. The
   aim of this paper is to report a new case of this complication. A second
   filter was inserted between the undeployed filter and the renal veins to
   prevent proximal migration of the transvenous interruption device to the
   pulmonary artery or the right side of the heart, and to guarantee an
   effective prophylaxis of further pulmonary embolization. Two years
   later, the vena cava was still patent.
   The hest way to avoid this accident is a perfect insertion technique:
   after a preoperative cavography to check diameter and patency of the
   vena cava, the filter must be deployed by retracting the introducer
   sheath while maintaining the position of the inner canula, and not
   pushing the filter out of the introducer sheath. A second filter must
   always be available in the operating room in case of incomplete opening
   of the filter.
   The use of vena cava filter is not devoid of risks. Restricted
   indications are therefore recommended (J Mal Vasc 1996; 21: pages
   312-314).},

Abstract = {This paper describes a kind of mobile robot, named cable-climbing robot,
   and its motion planning development. That robotic system is capable of
   moving over electricity distribution lines, which can easily overcome
   the obstacles present in those installations like insulators, thanks to
   its kinematic motion planning of collision avoidance. The cable-climbing
   robot avoids the obstacles by the adoption of sequential movement
   planning with the objective of climbing insulators in electric posts.
   This approach avoids the obstacles, making the robot-articulated
   suspensions to retract when it is close to the obstacle and to distend
   after it passes over it. This kind of movement is controlled by a
   geometric motion planning method which is performed by the quintic
   polynomial interpolation law. The kinematic modelling uses the
   screw-based Jacobian Method combining with Virtual Kinematic chains,
   which permits the usage of the Kirchhoff-Davies method. Thus obtaining
   the cable-climbing robot inverse kinematic model. Simulation shows the
   potential use of this technique to cope with the cable-climbing robots
   control.},

Title = {Research progress of surface atomic manipulation and physical property
   regulation of low-dimensional structures},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Atomic manipulation technique with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
   has been used to control the structural and physical properties of
   materials at an atomic level. Recently, this technique has been extended
   to modifying the physical properties of low-dimensional materials.
   Unlike conventional single atom lateral manipulation, the STM
   manipulation technique in the study of low-dimensional materials has
   additional manipulation modes and focuses on the modification of
   physical properties. In this review paper, we introduce the recent
   experimental progress of tuning the physical properties of
   low-dimensional materials through STM atomic manipulation technique.
   There are mainly four manipulation modes: 1) tip-induced local electric
   field; 2) controlled tip approach or retract; 3) tip-induced
   non-destructive geometry manipulation; 4) tip-induced kirigami and
   lithography. Through using these manipulation modes, the STM tip
   effectively introduces the attractive force or repulsive force, local
   electronic field or magnetic field and local strain, which results in
   the atomically precise modification of physical properties including
   charge density wave, Kondo effect, inelastic tunneling effect, Majorana
   bound states, and edge states.},

Title = {Study of the surface wettability effect on dynamic characteristics of
   droplet impacting a tube with different curvature ratios},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Surface wettability plays a significant role on the dynamic
   characteristics of droplet impact. In this paper, five different
   wettability surfaces are prepared for experiments by
   dislocation-selective chemical etching and surface modification, three
   of which are mainly discussed. The corresponding apparent contact angles
   are 13 degrees, 107 degrees, and 153 degrees, respectively. The dynamic
   processes of droplets impacting the hydrophilic, hydrophobic and
   super-hydrophobic tubular surfaces with the impact velocity of 0.94 m/s
   are observed by high speed photography. The effect of surface
   wettability on droplet impact is analysed with the curvature ratios of
   1.4, 0.43, and 0.26, respectively. It is found that the increase of the
   curvature ratio hinders rebound but promotes the break-up of the
   droplet. When the curvature ratio is a constant, poor surface
   wettability hinders droplet spreading, but promotes retracting and
   rebounding; An interesting phenomenon is found that, when the contact
   angle is a constant, the maximum spreading factor increases firstly and
   then decreases with the increase in the curvature ratio, i.e., there is
   a critical curvature ratio for each contact angle.},

Abstract = {New high-tech smart windows have a great impact on reducing heating and
   cooling costs in buildings in comparison with the conventional window
   systems. However the initial costs of these windows are rather too much.
   This paper demonstrates two new methods for constructing low-cost smart
   windows that can respond to the level of thermal condition according to
   basic laws of thermodynamics. The first method is based on the
   variations in pressure of a trapped gas at different temperature
   conditions which can move up and down a thin layer of a colored liquid
   as a sunshade, and the second one is a two phase liquid liquid
   (transparent translucent) fluid with different thermal expansion
   coefficients that allows one phase to rise or sink faster than the other
   one, in response to temperature variations, and thus casting or
   retracting an opaque light filter. The calculations and results of
   experimental tests showed that not only the incoming light can be
   adjusted without the use of electricity, but also the initial costs of
   construction can be reduced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   retracting from long-term projects. United States (US) hydraulic
   fracturing has offered a partial solution. The unique material
   properties of hydraulic fracturing give it-relative to conventional
   production-a small investment scope with a short cycle of production.
   This flexible production process has helped sections of the industry
   avoid the commodity's uncertain outlook by narrowly focusing on the near
   term. However, hydraulic fracturing, while offering a different temporal
   and financial scale of investment, is often more expensive per barrel.
   Confronted by COVID-19 disruptions, massive debt, and public
   contestation, some predict the end of fracking, as the least profitable,
   most indebted players go under. This paper hypothesizes that
   intensifying uncertainty over the future of oil - above all from the
   renewable energy transition - will, however, ironically further
   stimulate this destructive form of extraction.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a dynamical model of simply-supported spinning pipes
   conveying fluid with axial deployment is proposed and the transverse
   free vibration and stability for such a doubly gyroscopic system
   involving time-dependent parameters are investigated. The partial
   differential equations of motion are derived by the extended Hamilton
   principle and then truncated by the Galerkin technique. The time-variant
   frequencies, mode shapes and responses to initial conditions are
   comprehensively investigated to reveal the dynamical essence of the
   system. It is indicated that the qualitative stability evolution of the
   system mainly depends on the effect of fluid-structure interaction
   (FSI), while the spinning motion will enhance the pipe rigidity and
   eliminate the buckling instability. The dynamical evolution of a
   retracting pipe is almost inverse to that of the deploying one. The pipe
   possesses different mode configurations of spatial curves as the pipe
   length increases and some modal and response characteristics of the
   present system are found rather distinct from those of deploying
   cantilevered structures. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate in situ recognition of protein adsorption
   onto a polymer surface with scanning force microscopy by probe-surface
   adhesion measurements and topography imaging with protein-coated probes.
   Albumin-coated probes have been employed in studies of albumin and
   fibrinogen adsorption to hydrophobic polystyrene surfaces. The adhesion
   between force microscope probes and sample surfaces were determined
   using profiles of retract force-distance curves. A large adhesion force
   profile resulted when the force-distance curves were measured on
   protein-free polystyrene surfaces. When the measurements were conducted
   on protein-exposed polystyrene surfaces, the force-distance curves
   showed negligible adhesion. The same coated probes were also used for in
   situ topographic imaging. Applications of this novel approach are
   described: first, the location of boundaries of preadsorbed protein
   films and, second, the dynamic detection of protein adsorption onto
   polystyrene surfaces. Two-dimensional adhesion energy maps were obtained
   by employing ``layered imaging{''}. We also note that an increase in
   pressure exerted by the force microscope probe results in penetration of
   a protein film and contact of the probe with the underlying polystyrene.},

Abstract = {Hazardous environments gave a big challenge for the human to accomplish
   the desired tasks, especially in sampling and collecting materials
   either for securing the locality or research purposes. Hence,
   teleoperated robots with robotic arms have been proposed to execute any
   tasks that appointed. However, most robotic arms on the teleoperated
   robots only serve specific tasks and have no ability to retract arm with
   precise and smooth movement, which will compromise its functionality. In
   this paper, five designs of robotic arms were proposed with different
   mechanisms for its retractions. Evaluation and selection for the final
   design was decided based on the decision-making process for all designs.
   Considering important criterion, evaluation was performed using concept
   scoring. All concept designs were modelled and analysed in SolidWorks.
   Load was applied on the end effector of robotic arm to observe Von Mises
   criteria of designed arms. Both methods indicate that design 5 with
   linear motor mechanism has the best endurance and thus, chosen as the
   most suitable design to be mounted on the track vehicle.},

   Lamba(1) The above article from the Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and
   Therapeutics, published online on 21 November 2017 in Wiley Online
   Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted following
   discussions with the authors, the Journal Editors and John Wiley \& Sons
   Ltd. The Retraction has been agreed as this paper was submitted under
   the joint names of Yan Wang, Jatinder K. Lamba and a third co-author.
   After acceptance of the paper, Dr Wang wrote to the EiC asking for the
   name of the third co-author to be dropped because of insufficient
   contribution. The EiC asked that the request be signed by all three
   authors. When this arrived, the paper was published online with only Dr
   Wang and Dr Lamba. However, Dr Lamba wrote to the EiC after publication
   indicating that she had not previously seen the manuscript and that
   there were co-authors missing. As it is clear that Dr Lamba's signature
   was forged, we cannot rely on the integrity of the report. The
   retraction is with the agreement of Dr Lamba but not of Dr Wang.

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Microglia are resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS)
   that originate from myeloid progenitor cells in the embryonic yolk sac
   and are maintained independently of circulating monocytes throughout
   life. In the healthy state, microglia are highly dynamic and control the
   environment by rapidly extending and retracting their processes. When
   the CNS is inflamed, microglia can give rise to macrophages, but the
   regulatory mechanisms underlying this process have not been fully
   elucidated. Recent genetic studies have suggested that microglial
   function is compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that
   environmental factors such as diet and brain injury also affect
   microglial activation. In addition, studies of triggering receptor
   expressed on myeloid cells 2-deficiency in AD mice revealed
   heterogeneous microglial reactions at different disease stages,
   complicating the therapeutic strategy for AD. In this paper, we describe
   the relationship between genetic and environmental risk factors and the
   roles of microglia in AD pathogenesis, based on studies performed in
   human patients and animal models. We also discuss the mechanisms of
   inflammasomes and neurotransmitters in microglia, which accelerate the
   development of amyloid-beta and tau pathology.},

Abstract = {The Random PROLOG Processor (RPP) is an abstract model for logical
   computations based on the concept of information\_molecules
   quasi-randomly traveling and inferring in abstract computational\_space.
   The simulated process or problem is defined in terms of PROLOG clauses
   (or sets of clauses encapsulated by membranes) seeded into the RPP by
   the programmer as a program. During the computational process,
   information\_molecules move about, rendezvous, exchange internal
   information, modify themselves, assert other information\_molecules (or
   are retracted), disintegrate, or expire. Computations are
   unification-based logical inferences. In the RPP, the computations are
   parallel, randomly evolving processes. The RPP exhibits some properties
   of the DNA-computer, but can be considered for any computational
   environment. The RPP is proposed as a promising tool for parallel
   evolutionary computing, because PROLOG is a widely known, powerful
   language; because prices of multiprocessor architectures are falling
   sharply; and because parallel RPP implementation is easy. Since they are
   declarative and nondeterministic, RPP programs are extremely short. This
   paper presents the structure of the RPP application for parallel
   Evolutionary Computations with different types of problems. (C) 1997

Title = {Strong convergence of Cesaro mean iterations for nonexpansive

Journal = {FIXED POINT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2007},
Abstract = {Let E be a real uniformly convex Banach space which admits a weakly
   sequentially continuous duality mapping from E to E{*}, C a nonempty
   closed convex subset of E which is also a sunny nonexpansive retract of
   E, and T : C -> E a non-expansive nonself-mapping with F( T) not equal
   circle divide. In this paper, we study the strong convergence of two
   sequences generated by x(n+1) = alpha(n)x+ (1- alpha(n))(1/n+ 1)
   Sigma(n)(j= 0)(PT)(j)(xn) and y(n+1) = (1/n+1)Sigma P-n(j= 0)(alpha(n)y
   + (1- alpha(n))(TP)(j)(yn)) for all n >= 0, where x, x(0), y, y(0) is an
   element of C, \{alpha(n)\} is a real sequence in an interval {[} 0, 1],
   and P is a sunny non-expansive retraction of E onto C. We prove that
   \{x(n)\} and \{y(n)\} converge strongly to Qx and Qy, respectively, as n
   ->infinity, where Q is a sunny non-expansive retraction of C onto F( T).
   The results presented in this paper generalize, extend, and improve the
   corresponding results of Matsushita and Kuroiwa (2001) and many others.

Abstract = {Next to climate change on the list of challenges faced by humankind in
   today's technological age is energy management. While ``smart{''} ideas
   continue to gather momentum as some of the ways earmarked to combat the
   menace of a changing climate, coupled with efficient management of
   energy, research and development in the blockchain is not retracting,
   recently giving rise to digital currencies capable of fueling massive
   energy consumption via mining of ``crypto-coins{''}. Given that
   sustainability is a crucial goal in the design of smart cities nowadays,
   there are currently no assurances of sustainable cities where
   cryptocurrency mining is at full scale. Nevertheless, alternative energy
   sources may come to the rescue in no distant time. In this paper, we
   contextualize energy-use in smart cities through mining of virtual
   currencies, in order to predict whether or not smart cities can truly be
   sustainable if crypto-mining is sustained. An attempt is also made to
   emphasize the possible ways of reducing energy use and all activities
   involving digital currencies by seeking to replace ``Proof of Work{''}
   (PoW) with improved alternatives.},

Abstract = {Space manipulator is an important tool of spacecraft to complete a
   variety of tasks, such as release and retracting of satellite, assembly
   and maintenance of space station in orbit. The trajectory precision of
   the end effector determines whether the mechanism performs normally or
   not. Nowadays the harmonic drive is widely used as the reducer in the
   space manipulator, which will lead to the kinematic hysteresis.
   Considering the effect of the boundary conditions between the joint and
   loading end, this paper calculates the accurate flexible arm vibration
   modal by solving method of non-constraint boundary modal and analyzes
   the hysteresis of harmonic reducer. The dynamics equations with
   hysteretic characteristic for flexible space manipulator is shown based
   on non-constraint boundary modal. In order to describe the output error,
   the precision indices are proposed. Taking advantage of the material
   elastic modulus E of flexible space manipulator and the hysteresis angle
   Phi, the output characteristics of flexible space manipulator are
   studied. According to the accuracy requirement of actual working
   condition, this paper gets the corresponding minimum modulus 106.4 GPa
   which meets the actual demand when the precision index R is 90\%. The
   results can be used in designing and optimizing future space
   manipulators.},

Abstract = {In April 2022, a first-year PhD student published his first
   peer-reviewed article in the journal Qualitative Research. Less than
   four months later, amid viral public outrage, that article, Karl
   Andersson's ``I am not alone - we are all alone: Using masturbation as
   an ethnographic method in research on shota subculture in Japan,{''} was
   removed from publication and formally retracted by the Journal Editors.
   This paper explores the controversy surrounding the so-called
   ``masturbation article{''} and its relevance to the field of publishing
   studies. I begin with a general overview of the shota manga genre and
   its legal context and provide a factual short history of the affair. I
   then demonstrate what a good-faith positive peer review of Andersson's
   article may have included and critically assess Qualitative Research's
   Retraction Notice, alongside other published ethical complaints. I
   conclude by showing how both Andersson's article and the Japanese manga
   he studies have been censored for the same reasons, with troubling
   implications for freedom of speech in the twenty-first century.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the author presents a new visual system that can aid
   visually impaired people in walking. The system provides object
   information (that is, shape and location) through the sense of touch.
   This visual system depends on three different components: (i) an
   infrared camera sensor that detects the obstruction, (ii) a control
   system that measures the distance between the obstruction and the
   sensor, and (iii) a tooling apparatus with small pins (I center dot 1
   mm) used in forming a three-dimensional shape of the obstruction. The
   pins, arranged on a 6x6 matrix, move longitudinally between the
   retracted and extended positions based on the distance data. The pin
   extends individually, while the pin tip reflects the object's outer
   surface. The length of the pin from the base surface is proportional to
   the distance of the sensor from the obstruction. An ultrasonic actuator,
   controlled at a 15Hz frame rate, is the driving force for the pin
   movement. The tactile image of the 3D shape can provide information
   about the obstruction.},

Abstract = {Effective organ retraction is essential to ensure safe and efficient
   surgery, in the case of laparoscopic surgery, organ retraction is
   particularly difficult to achieve. Currently such as cherry dissectors
   are used for retraction, however the small size results in excessive
   stress on the organ being retracted. Therefore, we are developing a
   balloon-based retractor that provides similar functionality as the
   cherry dissector, particularly being able to pass through a small port,
   yet being expandable to provide a much greater contact area as well as
   improved traction, thus providing increased operating efficiency and
   improved safety in organ retraction. In this paper, the relative merits
   and demerits of a number of currently available retractors are compared.
   Parameters under consideration include shape, size, effective traction
   (coefficient of friction), type of actuation and ease of use. While
   parameters such as pressure distribution and effective traction have
   been objectively measured, other attributes unique to the individual
   mechanisms are discussed, and finally feedback is provided from surgeons
   regarding the respective retractor's ease of use and perceived efficacy.},

Abstract = {Construction of key poses is one of the most tedious and time consuming
   steps in synthesizing of 3D virtual actors. Recent alternate schemes
   expect the user to specify two inputs. Along with a neutral 3D reference
   model, more intuitive 2D inputs such as sketches, photographs or video
   frames are provided. Using these, of all the possible configurations,
   the ``best{''} 3D virtual actor is posed
   In this paper, we provide a solution to this ill-posed problem. We first
   give a solution to the problem of finding an approximate view consistent
   with the 2D sketch. Elements of this rigid-body solution are novel.
   Next, we provide a new solution to the process of extending or
   retracting limbs to more accurately suit the sketch. This posing
   algorithm, is based on a search based scheme inspired by anthropometric
   evidence. Less physical work is required by the actor to reach the
   desired pose from the base position. We also show that our algorithm
   converges to an acceptable solution much faster compared to the previous
   methods.},

Abstract = {Automation is one of the foremost technological trends in mining.
   Automation empowers mining companies to work around the clock and
   maximize productivity. Robotics brings a new degree of security to
   mines, from mechanical drills to self-driving ore trucks. However,
   designing a robotic system is challenging because they work in small
   spaces, drill the mines when there are hard rocks, or can damage
   themselves by overextending or retracting. The safety of these robots is
   also essential to ensure they work correctly. This paper formally
   modeled a robotic mining arm that could damage itself if a sensor fails.
   This report demonstrates how the damage caused by sensor failure can be
   prevented by formally modeling the system and ensuring it would not
   damage itself. Moreover, our robotic arm is reconfigurable and capable
   of dealing with hazardous situations. We formally modeled our system
   using a model-checking tool UPPAAL and verified the system in various
   hazardous situations. The system is verified for safety, liveness,
   fairness, and deadlock-freeness constraints. The results show that the
   methodology is suitable for modeling, simulating, and verifying
   reconfigurable systems.},

   energy consumption is reduced. In this paper, the flapping foils are
   arranged in tandem on both sides of the ship and are subjected to water
   pressure and shear forces, which passively change the angle of attack
   and produce force to propel the ship. The foils can be deployed in rough
   seas to stabilize the ship and retracted in calm water. The ship's
   motions with foils are modeled and the influence of flapping foils on
   ship stability is investigated in the frequency domain, which reveals
   that foils improve ship stability. Numerical studies in STAR-CCM + show
   that the foils may extract wave energy to propel the ship and generate
   an anti-pitching moment under different wave encounter angles and
   different ship speeds.},

Title = {Three-dimensional study of double droplets impact on a
   wettability-patterned surface},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {248},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {In this paper, a three-dimensional multi-relaxation-time pseudopotential
   lattice Boltzmann model is adopted to study the double droplets impact
   on a wettability-patterned surface. The effects of several factors like
   the wettability difference, the Weber number and the droplet spacing on
   the droplet dynamic behavior are studied in detail. The numerical
   results show that the unbalanced Young's force caused by the wetting
   difference will induce the droplets to rebound or migrate laterally
   toward the region with high-wettability. In addition, there exist three
   evolutionary phases for the double droplets impact on the
   wettability-patterned surface: the asymmetric spreading phase,
   asymmetric retracting phase, and wetting equilibrium phase. Further,
   when the Weber number is relatively smaller, a secondary spreading
   behavior could be observed which in turn causes an increase in the
   contact time. Finally, as far as the influence of the droplet spacing is
   concerned, we find that the flow patterns for different droplet spacings
   are largely different, and the presence of a air cavity could reduce the
   contact time.},

Abstract = {The main goals of this paper are focused on the implement visual
   feedback controller for cable-suspended robot (CSR), especially for
   pick-and-place operation. This study will propose a novel algorithm
   which is combined CSR coordinate transformation with image recognition
   to manipulate the suspended gripper to the desire position for assigned
   material handling tasks. Two webcams are introduced to sense the
   orientation of the end-effector, one is calculated the horizontal planar
   coordinate of the target, and the other is measured the vertical height
   for the target. Accordingly, the two-dimensional spatial image can be
   converted into 3-D image coordinates by using such approach. Based on
   the sensing information, the robots can convert the target position to
   the required cable lengths and then driving the servomotor to retract
   (or release) the cable lengths to manipulate the suspended gripper to
   the desired position. Several experiments will be carried out to verify
   the proposed methodology. The widespread variety of themes that are
   deliberated in this study can be applied to cranes, aerostats, and
   others large-scale manufacturing usages that need cable-driven robots.},

Journal = {GENDER AND EDUCATION},

Pages = {259-272},
Abstract = {Cultural stories provide us with a repertoire of narratives through
   which we interpret and construct our understandings of the world,
   including our gendered understandings of the early childhood teacher.
   Through her notion of ecriture feminine, Cixous {[}1976. The Laugh of
   the Medusa. Trans K. Cohen and P. Cohen. Signs: Journal of Women in
   Culture and Society 1 (4): 875-893] wrote of countering systems of
   cultural texts that inscribe women as other'. In this paper, I conduct a
   critical analysis of Disney's Maleficent (2014), a recent and often
   deemed feminist adaptation of the Sleeping Beauty tale, to inform our
   understanding of the challenges faced in rewriting public perceptions of
   the childcare teacher in Canada today. The early childhood teacher is
   often constrained within gendered expectations and attempts to revise
   the ways society values their professional status have yet to be
   achieved. The analysis suggests that Maleficent offers positive
   directions for change, however persistent constraints on feminine
   identities may be particularly difficult to retract in women whose work
   involves significant caring and other-directedness.},

Title = {A neural network model of inhibitory processes in subliminal priming},
Journal = {VISUAL COGNITION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Pages = {401-480},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Masked priming experiments have revealed a precise set of facilitatory
   and inhibitory visuomotor control processes. Most notably, inhibitory
   effects have been identified in which prime-target compatibility induces
   performance costs and prime-target in compatibility induces performance
   benefits. We argue that this profile of data is commensurate with an
   ``emergency braking mechanism{''}, whereby responses can be retracted as
   a result of changing sensory evidence. The main contribution of this
   paper is to provide a neural network-based explanation of this
   phenomenon. This is obtained through the use of feed forward inhibition
   to implement backward masking, lateral inhibition to implement response
   competition, and opponent processing mechanisms to implement response
   retraction. Although the model remains simple, it does a very good job
   of reproducing the available masked priming data. For example, it
   reproduces a large spectrum of reaction time data across a number of
   different experimental conditions. Perhaps most notably, however, it
   also reproduces lateralized readiness potentials that have been recorded
   while subjects perform different conditions. In addition, it provides a
   concrete set of testable predictions.},

Abstract = {It has been known that categorical interpretations of dependent type
   theory with Sigma- and Id types induce weak factorization systems. When
   one has a weak factorization system (L, R) on a category I in hand, it
   is then natural to ask whether or not (L, R) harbors an interpretation
   of dependent type theory with Sigma- and Id- (and possibly Pi-) types.
   Using the framework of display map categories to phrase this question
   more precisely, one would ask whether or not there exists a class D of
   morphisms of C such that the retract closure of D is the class R and the
   pair (C, D) forms a display map category modeling Sigma- and Id- (and
   possibly Pi-) types. In this paper, we show, with the hypothesis that C
   is Cauchy complete, that there exists such a class D if and only if (C,
   R) itself forms a display map category modeling Sigma- and Id - (and
   possibly Pi-) types. Thus, we reduce the search space of our original
   question from a potentially proper class to a singleton.},

Abstract = {We consider the problem of covering a planar environment, possibly
   containing unknown obstacles, using a robot of square size DxD attached
   to a fixed point S by a cable of finite length L. The environment is
   discretized into 4-connected grid cells with resolution proportional to
   the robot size. Starting at S, the task of the robot is to visit each
   cell in the environment that are not occupied by obstacles and return to
   S with the cable fully retracted. Our goal is to minimize the total
   distance traveled by the robot to fully cover the unknown environment
   while avoiding tangling of the cable. In this paper, we present a novel
   online algorithm to solve this problem that achieves 2-approximation for
   the total distance traveled by the robot compared to the minimum
   distance that needs to be traveled. Our algorithm significantly improves
   the 2L/D-approximation achieved by the best previously known online
   algorithm designed for this problem. The approximation bound is also
   validated using rigorous simulated experiments.},

Title = {Russell's repsychologising of the proposition},
Journal = {SYNTHESE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {151},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-124},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Bertrand Russell's 1903 masterpiece The Principles of Mathematics places
   great emphasis on the need to separate propositions from psychological
   items such as thoughts. In 1919 (and until the end of his career)
   Russell explicitly retracts this view, however, and defines propositions
   as ``psychological occurrences{''}. These psychological occurrences are
   held by Russell to be mental images. In this paper, I seek to explain
   this radical change of heart. I argue that Russell's re-psychologising
   of the proposition in 1919 can only be understood against the background
   of his struggle with the problem of the unity of the proposition in
   earlier work. Once this is recognized, and the solution to the problem
   offered by the 1919 theory is appreciated, new light is also shed on
   Russell's naturalism. I go on to compare Russell's psychological
   ``picture theory{''} with the vehemently anti-psychological picture
   theory of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and suggest
   that, once the background of the dispute is brought into clearer focus,
   Russell's position can be seen to have many advantages over its more
   celebrated rival.},

Abstract = {A fiber-complemented graph is a graph for which the inverse image of
   every prefiber (or gated set) by any projection map onto a prefiber is a
   prefiber. In this paper, we continue the study of these graphs and
   establish a retraction theorem and fixed point properties for
   endomorphisms. Adding the notion of mooring (these are particular
   retractions of a graph onto its prefibers) to the tools introduced in
   Part I of this work (Discrete Math. 226 (2001) 107), we show that a
   fiber-complemented graph whose elementary prefibers induce moorable
   graphs is a retract of a Cartesian product of elementary moorable
   graphs. Then we deduce that under some conditions of compacticity, the
   elements of every commuting family of endomorphisms of a moorable
   pre-median graph strictly stabilize a nonempty finite pre-median
   subgraph (pre-median graphs are particular instances of weakly modular
   graphs which are fiber-complemented). These results give generalizations
   of analogous properties related to median graphs, quasi-median graphs,
   pseudo-median graphs and weakly median graphs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {Single image based three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction has
   become an important research topic for computer vision and computer
   graphics fields to provide machine vision systems with near human visual
   perception. Previous approaches for 3D scene reconstruction and depth
   estimation from single images required many factors including motion
   parallax, stereoscopic parallels, and various monocular depth cues
   adopted from known geometric priors. Deep learning based depth
   estimation techniques have advanced single image based depth estimation
   by aggregating various complexity information from RGB depth image
   datasets for training images to drive the process. This paper proposes
   an effective 3D scene estimation methodology by automatically extracting
   vanishing point and semantic information including 3D geometric
   characteristics without prior assumptions. The vanishing point is
   extracted from line segments and minimum spanning tree clustering to
   remove spurious noisy edges. Retracting geometric and semantic
   information from a given image is achieved by a generative adversarial
   network trained on the created training set. We verified the proposed
   approach's efficiency and effectiveness experimentally with a large
   database created by directly recovering 3D scenes from from an input
   image.},

Abstract = {With the in-depth understanding of vehicle's safety knowledge and the
   increase of seatbelt's wearing rates, people pay more and more attention
   to seatbelt's wearing comfort and rapid retraction performance. Also,
   the Chinese market's complaint about seatbelt is increasing. From the
   IQS result, the main part of seatbelt's IQS complaint in Chinese market
   is about seatbelt's retraction performance, and it shows an upward
   trend. The friction between seatbelt's through ring and webbing is an
   important factor that influences the performance of seatbelt's
   retraction, but there is no enough research result or selection standard
   about the friction coefficient of the through ring and webbing. In this
   paper, we analyzed the layout of seatbelt and the main factors affecting
   webbing's retraction, set orthogonal test matrix for the combination of
   different through rings and webbings, obtained the friction
   coefficients, and analyzed its influence to the webbing's pull-out and
   retract force. This work will provide a lot of convenience for the
   development of follow-up vehicles.},
