Title = {RETRACTION: Diagnostic accuracy and safety of electromagnetic navigation
   transthoracic needle biopsy under moderate sedation for the diagnosis of
   peripheral pulmonary lesions (vol 12, pg 1496, 2023) (Retraction of Vol
   12, Pg 1496, 2023)},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL LUNG CANCER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 24},
Abstract = {Background: Novel approaches using virtual computed tomography (CT)
   guidance, namely electromagnetic navigation transthoracic needle biopsy
   (EMN-TTNB), enable physicians to perform percutaneous lung biopsies.
   However, there are very few studies on the clinical experiences of
   EMN-TTNB, and in previous studies, the procedure was usually performed
   under deep sedation. This study aimed to determine the diagnostic
   accuracy and safety of EMN-TTNB under moderate sedation. Methods: We
   conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent EMN-TTNB
   under moderate sedation between May 2021 and November 2022 at Hallym
   University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital in South Korea. Moderate
   sedation was achieved with midazolam injection in the bronchoscopy room
   using the Veran SPiNperc EM guidance system (Veran Medical, St Louis,
   MO, USA). Clinical data were collected by review of medical records, and
   diagnostic accuracy and safety were calculated. Results: Thirty-two
   patients were enrolled (mean age 70.8 +/- 11.1 years); 56.3\% were male.
   The mean size of the pulmonary lesions was 36.9 +/- 17.4 mm, and the
   median (interquartile range) distance from the pleura was 15.5
   (0.0-30.0) mm. The diagnostic accuracy of EMN-TTNB was 75.0\% (21/28),
   excluding four indeterminate cases. Fourteen patients (50.0\%, 14/28)
   had true-positive and seven patients (25.0\%, 7/28) had true-negative
   lesions. There were no severe adverse reactions such as pneumothorax,
   respiratory failure, or death, except one case of hemoptysis.
   Conclusions: EMN-TTNB under moderate sedation showed an acceptable
   diagnostic accuracy and good safety profile. The new technology allows
   physicians to perform percutaneous lung biopsies without the
   intervention of a radiologist or anesthesiologist.},

Abstract = {As a basic place for human daily life, the safety performance of
   architectural structure in practical application directly determines the
   future trend of social economy and urban construction development. By
   understanding the relationship between the internal and external
   environment of the structure and using advanced theoretical knowledge to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the structure, we can find effective
   countermeasures to solve the problem. Therefore, on the basis of
   defining the stochastic process model of resistance, this paper uses the
   reliability period analysis method to compare the structural
   effectiveness indicators of the proposed structure and the existing
   structure, and thus makes clear the differences between the traditional
   reliability calculation method and the time period analysis method, and
   analyzes the particularity of different structures.},

Abstract = {Aim: The leukocytes were affected by anesthesia and intravenous
   anesthetics. The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of
   these medicines preoperatively to evaluate the effects of intravenous
   anesthesia and anesthesia method on leukocytes, which are substantial
   immune system cells. Material and Methods: One hundred participants who
   were recovering from surgery between November 2021 and March 2022 were
   the subject of the prognostic research. Before induction, a
   participant's blood was drawn, and six hours following the procedure, a
   further blood specimen was collected. For all specimens, complete blood
   count (CBC) tests were performed to determine leukocyte levels before
   and after surgery. Results: In general, the mean neutrophil counts rose
   after surgery, whereas the mean lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and
   basophil counts declined. Leukocytes are more affected by general
   anesthesia than by other types of anesthesia. With the exception of
   pentothal, all hypnotic anesthetic medications affected the level of
   leukocytes. Individuals who received analgesics had a clear impact on
   leukocytes compared with those without analgesia. Moreover, leukocyte
   alterations for muscle relaxant have been observed; this resulted in
   lower cell, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils levels but
   higher neutrophils counts. Most intravenous anesthesia showed
   substantial alterations when measured by neutrophil and lymphocyte count
   (p<0.05). Discussion: All analgesics, hypnotics, and muscle relaxants,
   with the exception of pentothal, may reduce lymphocytes, particularly
   cells. An increase in neutrophil levels could occur when intravenous
   anesthetics are given postoperatively.},

Abstract = {The above article, published online on 16th October 2009 in Wiley Online
   Library () and corrected in 2014 with a Corrigendum (JNeurochem 128(6):
   975, URL: ) correcting Figure 3 of the original publication, has been
   retracted by agreement between the journal's Editor-in-Chief, Andrew
   Lawrence, the International Society for Neurochemistry and John Wiley \&
   Sons Ltd. The retraction has been agreed due to concerns raised
   regarding possible image manipulation of Figure 5b. Corresponding author
   Alba Minelli as well as all other authors have been contacted to clarify
   their respective contribution to the article, and provide the original
   scanned films upon request for the editorial team's review.
   Corresponding author Alba Minelli confirmed the following author
   contributions in the corrected version (J Neurochem. 2014
   Mar;128(6):975) as the final version of the published manuscript which
   all authors had read and approved: A. Minelli (contact): substantial
   contribution to conception and design, drafting the article, data
   interpretation, C .Conte: real-time PCR and gene silencing experiments,
   data acquisition and analysis, S. Grottelli: data acquisition and
   analysis, I. Bellezza: drafting the article, data acquisition and
   analysis, C. Emiliani: revising the article critically for important
   intellectual content, J. Bolanos: revising the article critically for
   important intellectual content. Since the original data could not be
   retrieved to dispel the new concerns regarding Figure 5 of the original
   publication, the journal no longer has confidence in the results and
   conclusions drawn.

   (), has been retracted by agreement between the journal's
   Editor-in-Chief, Dr. Daniel H. Solomon, the American College of
   Rheumatology, and Wiley Periodicals LLC. The retraction has been agreed
   following a post-hoc analysis by the research's funder, TRB Chemedica
   International SA, that identified a discrepancy between the preliminary
   results of the post-hoc analysis and the results of the published
   article. The statistical analysis performed using the original database
   is deemed no longer reliable and the conclusions of the original study
   regarding the efficacy of diacerein versus placebo are not supported by
   robust data. As a result, the editors and funder are issuing this
   retraction.},

Abstract = {This article has been retracted at the authors' request and approved by
   the Editor in Chief. In this article, authors proposed and analyzed
   novel fractional order controllers (original contribution of the
   authors) for UAVs swarm formation and for the numerical validations, a
   simulation test bench (originally designed by the same group of authors)
   was utilized. The test bench that was published in another article by
   the same group of authors (https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/7/2401),
   was not properly cited in the current article. As such the authors deem
   it necessary to have their article withdrawn in the current form. The
   authors apologize to the scientific community for any inconveniences or
   challenges resulting from the publication and withdrawal of this

   Research Letters, 50, e2022GL101874, . The above article, published

   by agreement between the authors; the journal Editor-in-Chief, Harihar
   Rajaram; American Geophysical Union; and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The
   retraction has been agreed because the electron pitch angle data
   presented were contaminated by internally produced photoelectrons as a
   result of the illumination geometry of the sensor at the time of the
   observations. After removal of the affected angular bins by the
   instrument principal investigator, the published conclusions were found
   to be invalid. Therefore, the paper was retracted at the request of the
   authors.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Regardless of inequities in care, terminal anorexia nervosa
   exists: a response to Sharpe et al. (Retracted article. See vol. 11,

Abstract = {We are pleased that the concept of terminal anorexia nervosa is being
   considered in serious discussion. Our previous presentations were not
   intended to assess eating disorders care broadly, but solely to bring
   attention to the importance of end-of-life care issues for patients with
   anorexia nervosa. Regardless of differences in ability to access or
   utilize health care resources, inescapably, individuals contending with
   end-stage malnutrition due to anorexia nervosa who refuse further
   nutrition will progressively decline, and some will die as a result. Our
   description of these patients' last days and weeks as ``terminal{''} and
   meriting thoughtful end-of-life care is consistent with how the term is
   used in other end-stage terminal conditions. We clearly acknowledged
   that precise definitions and guidelines for end-of-life care for these
   patients should be developed by the eating disorder and palliative care
   fields. Avoiding the phrase ``terminal anorexia nervosa{''} will not
   make these phenomena disappear. We are sorry that some individuals are
   upset by this concept. Our intention is certainly not to demoralize by
   ``triggering{''} fears of hopelessness or death. But these discussions
   will inevitably distress some people. Individuals who are adversely
   affected by considering these issues might well benefit from further
   explorations, clarifications, and discussions with their clinicians and
   others. Finally, we clearly applaud expanding treatment options and
   availability, and we strongly advocate for making every effort to
   provide every patient every possible option for treatment and recovery
   at every phase of their struggles.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Non-Linear Analysis of Hybrid Reinforced T- Beam with Partial
   Substitution Recycled Rubberized Concrete (Retracted article. See JUL,
   2023)},

Abstract = {At present, the need to make use of industrial waste materials is
   increasing due to their harmful effects on the environment. In the
   present work, the behavior of hybrid reinforced T-Beam with partial
   substitution recycled rubberized concrete is studied. The finite element
   modeling by using ANSYS version 15 program. It contains also all the
   required steps needed to create the concrete models that were prepared
   to study the behavior of beams with partial substitution recycled
   rubberized concrete (RRC). The reinforcement of beams was various
   combinations of polymer GFRP and steel bars. The Rubberized concrete
   mixes were prepared by partial substitution 7.5 \%, 10 \%, and 12.5 \%
   replacements by volume. The ratio of GFRP to steel reinforcement at
   mid-span section was the second parameter investigated. Due to the large
   number of parameters affecting the behavior of Hybrid Reinforced T- Beam
   with partial substitution Recycled Rubberized Concrete, an extensive
   parametric study was performed using ANSYS version 15 program. Three
   parameters were investigated namely; Bottom RFT, compressive strength of
   concrete, and the existence of opening. The analytical results agree
   well with the experimental results in terms of mode of failure and the
   failure load values. The results indicated that although the flexural
   capacity of the tested specimen decreased with the addition of Crumb
   Rubber and reduced its self-weight. The failure load of the beam with
   partial substitution recycled rubberized concrete increases with bottom
   reinforcement by the GFRP bar or CFRP bar. Also, reinforced beams by
   CFRP bars had a higher failure load than reinforced beams by GFRP bars.
   Having an opening in hybrid reinforced T-Beam with partial substitution
   recycled rubberized concrete reduced the beam load capacity and maximum
   deflection. Also, using GFRP bars, and CFRP bars in the vicinity of
   openings in hybrid reinforced T-Beams increased the load capacity of
   these beams.},

   retracted by agreement between the journal Editor, Professor David W.
   Walker, School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University,
   Cardiff CF24 3AA, UK and Wiley Periodicals, LLC. The retraction has been
   agreed following an investigation based on allegations raised by a third
   party. Several inconsistencies including general logical flaws and
   irrelevant citations were found, making the motivation and conclusions
   of the article untrustworthy. The editorial office did not receive a
   response from the authors, and so requested underlying experimental data
   was not available for evaluation. Accordingly, the editors consider the
   conclusions of this manuscript invalid.},

   between the journal's Editor-in-Chief Andrew J. Lawrence, the
   International Society for Neurochemistry and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. The
   retraction has been agreed due to identification of image manipulation
   in Figure 4a, showing duplications of the `27-OHC' and `24-OHC+27-OHC'
   bands within the TH lane. The corresponding author and their institution
   failed to provide the original data upon request. As a result, the data
   and conclusions of the article are considered unreliable. The authors
   have been informed but did not respond to requests to approve the

Abstract = {This work presents a numerical algorithm based on the cubic B-spline
   quasi-interpolation method for the simulation of one and two-dimensional
   hyperbolic partial differential equations. In this method, cubic
   B-spline quasi-interpolation method is used for the approximation of
   spatial derivatives which produces a system of second-order ordinary
   differential equations. Further, the obtained system is decoupled into a
   system of first-order ordinary differential equations, and then forward
   difference approximation for time derivative is used to get final
   solutions. Some well-known problems from the literature are considered
   to check the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Transient jet ejections associated with limit-cycle behaviors

Abstract = {The ejection mechanism of transient relativistic jets from black hole
   binaries is studied. Based on observations of the limit-cycle behaviors
   of the superluminal jet source GRS 1915+105, we infer that transient jet
   ejections could happen just after the slim disk emerging from the
   standard disk at some distance runs over the standard disk and reaches
   the vicinity of the central black hole. The standard disk releases about
   half of the gravitational energy in the course of the accretion, but the
   released radiative energy could be absorbed by the optically thick slim
   disk covering the standard disk in this situation. Then, since the
   inward motion of the slim disk is much faster than that of the standard
   disk, a quantity of energy released by an amount of gas in the standard
   disk is received by the much smaller amount of gas in the slim disk. As
   a result, the energy per mass received by the slim disk is expected to
   be greatly amplified and is estimated to become highly relativistic.
   Since the energy is much larger than the gravitational energy, the
   height of the slim disk could increase significantly. Hence, the
   innermost part of the slim disk from which almost all the angular
   momentum has been transferred outward could have a much larger height
   than the black hole size, so they could collide with one another around
   the central axis of the disk, turning to an outward flow along the axis
   normal to the disk plane. The flow in this direction can be approximated
   to be that through the de Laval nozzle and could become supersonic near
   the distance where the flow has the smallest cross-section.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) secondary to drug toxicity
   has been reported in topical and systemic chemotherapy. We report the
   first case of LSCD arising from a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC),
   Daptopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), in a patient with breast cancer.Case
   description: A 66-year-old female with treatment-naive breast cancer was
   enrolled in a clinical trial with regimen of Dato-DXd in combination
   with Durvalumab. She suffered from blurred vision, photophobia and
   ocular pain of both eyes after administration of the regimen for 5
   months. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy with fluorescein staining revealed
   irregular epithelium at the upper 1/3 cornea. There was limited effect
   of topical steroid and lubricants, yet significant improvement after the
   cessation of Dato-DXd. The cornea resumed clear, and the best-corrected
   visual acuity were 20/20 in both eyes 6 months after discontinuation of
   Dato-DXd.Conclusion: Early detection of the ocular adverse reaction and
   cessation of the causative drug can avoid permanent ocular morbidity and
   visual impairment.},

Abstract = {Tigrivia baii gen. et sp. nov. (Coleoptera: Adephaga: Coptoclavidae) is
   described and named based on a fossil specimen from the Middle Jurassic
   Daohugou Biota, Nincheng County, Inner Mongolia of China. The fossil is
   very similar in morphology with the adult Coptoclava longipoda Ping 1928
   (Laiyang Formation of Nanligezhuang Village, Laiyang City, Shandong
   Province, China, Lower Cretaceous, 121 similar to 120 Ma), but differs
   from C. longipoda by the adjacencies of two procoxae and two mesocoxae.
   T. baii gen. et sp. nov. differs from Daohugounectes primitinus Wang et
   al. 2010 by the absence of striae on the elytra and the absence of
   ventral eyes under the head. The new beetle species shows developed
   aquatic adaptions, such as specialized raptorial forelegs, and swimming
   middle and hind legs. Furthermore, it is speculated to lead a similar
   lifestyle as extant Dytiscoidae, according to the two eyes on the side
   of head and the absence of spiracles on ventrites. This new fossil
   expanded our knowledge of the diversity of the Middle Jurassic
   Coptoclavid beetles in Daohugou Biota and improved our understanding of
   their paleoecological significance.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Simultaneously enhanced interfacial, mechanical properties
   and flame retardancy of high-density polyethylene-based composites using
   Mg,Al-containing melamine polyphosphate-grafted wood fibers (Retracted
   article. See JUN, 2023)},
Journal = {COMPOSITE INTERFACES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 10},
Abstract = {The mutual exclusiveness between hydrophilic wood fiber (WF) and
   hydrophobic high-density polyethylene (HDPE) together with their
   flammability restricts the engineering application of wood plastic
   composites (WPC). Herein, a magnesium and aluminum ions-modified
   melamine polyphosphate (MgAl-MP) was designed and in-situ grafted on the
   WF surface, for constructing a MgAl-MP three-dimensional (3D) network
   into the HDPE matrix. The results showed that such MgAl-MP 3D network
   endowed well-dispersed WF within matrix and superior interfacial
   compatibility between WF and HDPE. Based on the synergistic effect of
   MgAl-MP 3D network and WF, considerable improvement in mechanical
   properties and flame retardancy was achieved for composites. With adding
   about 13.8 wt.\% MgAl-MP (MgAl-MP:WF = 4:10, w/w) in composites, the
   maximum increments for tensile strength (50.6\%), Young's modulus
   (42.4\%), and elongation at break (53.3\%) were obtained, compared with
   pure WF/HDPE. Moreover, this unique MgAl-MP 3D network facilitated the
   catalytic charring and led to the effective inhibition in terms of heat
   transfer, flammable gases, and flame spread, resulting in easy
   achievement of>27\% (Limiting oxygen index) and V-0 rating (Underwriter
   laboratory-94 vertical burning rating). Considering simultaneously
   enhanced mechanical properties and flame retardancy, this work provides
   a new strategy in developing high-performance yet multi-functional WPC.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Physio-metabolic and clinical consequences of wearing face
   masks-Systematic review with meta-analysis and comprehensive evaluation
   (Retracted article. See vol. 11, 2023)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Background: As face masks became mandatory in most countries during the
   COVID-19 pandemic, adverse effects require substantiated investigation.
   Methods: A systematic review of 2,168 studies on adverse medical mask
   effects yielded 54 publications for synthesis and 37 studies for
   meta-analysis (on n = 8,641, m = 2,482, f = 6,159, age = 34.8 +/- 12.5).
   The median trial duration was only 18 min (IQR = 50) for our
   comprehensive evaluation of mask induced physio-metabolic and clinical
   outcomes.
   Results: We found significant effects in both medical surgical and N95
   masks, with a greater impact of the second. These effects included
   decreased SpO(2) (overall Standard Mean Difference, SMD = -0.24, 95\% CI
   = -0.38 to -0.11, p < 0.001) and minute ventilation (SMD = -0.72, 95\%
   CI = -0.99 to -0.46, p < 0.001), simultaneous increased in blood-CO2
   (SMD = +0.64, 95\% CI = 0.31-0.96, p < 0.001), heart rate (N95: SMD =
   +0.22, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.41, p = 0.02), systolic blood pressure
   (surgical: SMD = +0.21, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.39, p = 0.02), skin temperature
   (overall SMD = +0.80 95\% CI = 0.23-1.38, p = 0.006) and humidity (SMD
   +2.24, 95\% CI = 1.32-3.17, p < 0.001). Effects on exertion (overall
   SMD=+0.9, surgical=+0.63, N95 =+1.19), discomfort (SMD=+1.16), dyspnoea
   (SMD = +1.46), heat (SMD = +0.70), and humidity (SMD = +0.9) were
   significant in n = 373 with a robust relationship tomask wearing (p <
   0.006 to p < 0.001). Pooled symptom prevalence (n = 8,128) was
   significant for: headache (62\%, p < 0.001), acne (38\%, p < 0.001),
   skin irritation (36\%, p < 0.001), dyspnoea (33\%, p < 0.001), heat
   (26\%, p < 0.001), itching (26\%, p < 0.001), voice disorder (23\%, p <
   0.03), and dizziness (5\%, p = 0.01).
   Discussion: Masks interfered with O-2-uptake and CO2-release and
   compromised respiratory compensation. Though evaluated wearing durations
   are shorter than daily/prolonged use, outcomes independently validate
   mask-induced exhaustion-syndrome (MIES) and down-stream physio-metabolic
   disfunctions.
   MIES can have long-term clinical consequences, especially for vulnerable
   groups. So far, several mask related symptoms may have been
   misinterpreted as long COVID-19 symptoms. In any case, the possible MIES
   contrasts with the WHO definition of health.
   Conclusion: Face mask side-effects must be assessed (risk-benefit)
   against the available evidence of their effectiveness against viral
   transmissions. In the absence of strong empirical evidence of
   effectiveness, mask wearing should not be mandated let alone enforced by
   law.
