"BACKGROUND: NOVEL APPROACHES USING VIRTUAL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) GUIDANCE, NAMELY ELECTROMAGNETIC NAVIGATION TRANSTHORACIC NEEDLE BIOPSY (EMN-TTNB), ENABLE PHYSICIANS TO PERFORM PERCUTANEOUS LUNG BIOPSIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES ON THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCES OF EMN-TTNB, AND IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, THE PROCEDURE WAS USUALLY PERFORMED UNDER DEEP SEDATION. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY AND SAFETY OF EMN-TTNB UNDER MODERATE SEDATION. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT EMN-TTNB UNDER MODERATE SEDATION BETWEEN MAY 2021 AND NOVEMBER 2022 AT HALLYM UNIVERSITY DONGTAN SACRED HEART HOSPITAL IN SOUTH KOREA. MODERATE SEDATION WAS ACHIEVED WITH MIDAZOLAM INJECTION IN THE BRONCHOSCOPY ROOM USING THE VERAN SPINPERC EM GUIDANCE SYSTEM (VERAN MEDICAL, ST LOUIS, MO, USA). CLINICAL DATA WERE COLLECTED BY REVIEW OF MEDICAL RECORDS, AND DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY AND SAFETY WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED (MEAN AGE 70.8 +/- 11.1 YEARS); 56.3\% WERE MALE. THE MEAN SIZE OF THE PULMONARY LESIONS WAS 36.9 +/- 17.4 MM, AND THE MEDIAN (INTERQUARTILE RANGE) DISTANCE FROM THE PLEURA WAS 15.5 (0.0-30.0) MM. THE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF EMN-TTNB WAS 75.0\% (21/28), EXCLUDING FOUR INDETERMINATE CASES. FOURTEEN PATIENTS (50.0\%, 14/28) HAD TRUE-POSITIVE AND SEVEN PATIENTS (25.0\%, 7/28) HAD TRUE-NEGATIVE LESIONS. THERE WERE NO SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS SUCH AS PNEUMOTHORAX, RESPIRATORY FAILURE, OR DEATH, EXCEPT ONE CASE OF HEMOPTYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: EMN-TTNB UNDER MODERATE SEDATION SHOWED AN ACCEPTABLE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY AND GOOD SAFETY PROFILE. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO PERFORM PERCUTANEOUS LUNG BIOPSIES WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF A RADIOLOGIST OR ANESTHESIOLOGIST."

"AIM: THE LEUKOCYTES WERE AFFECTED BY ANESTHESIA AND INTRAVENOUS ANESTHETICS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THESE MEDICINES PREOPERATIVELY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF INTRAVENOUS ANESTHESIA AND ANESTHESIA METHOD ON LEUKOCYTES, WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIAL IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: ONE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE RECOVERING FROM SURGERY BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2021 AND MARCH 2022 WERE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROGNOSTIC RESEARCH. BEFORE INDUCTION, A PARTICIPANT'S BLOOD WAS DRAWN, AND SIX HOURS FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE, A FURTHER BLOOD SPECIMEN WAS COLLECTED. FOR ALL SPECIMENS, COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE LEUKOCYTE LEVELS BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY. RESULTS: IN GENERAL, THE MEAN NEUTROPHIL COUNTS ROSE AFTER SURGERY, WHEREAS THE MEAN LYMPHOCYTE, MONOCYTE, EOSINOPHIL, AND BASOPHIL COUNTS DECLINED. LEUKOCYTES ARE MORE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ANESTHESIA THAN BY OTHER TYPES OF ANESTHESIA. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PENTOTHAL, ALL HYPNOTIC ANESTHETIC MEDICATIONS AFFECTED THE LEVEL OF LEUKOCYTES. INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED ANALGESICS HAD A CLEAR IMPACT ON LEUKOCYTES COMPARED WITH THOSE WITHOUT ANALGESIA. MOREOVER, LEUKOCYTE ALTERATIONS FOR MUSCLE RELAXANT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED; THIS RESULTED IN LOWER CELL, LYMPHOCYTES, MONOCYTES, EOSINOPHILS AND BASOPHILS LEVELS BUT HIGHER NEUTROPHILS COUNTS. MOST INTRAVENOUS ANESTHESIA SHOWED SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATIONS WHEN MEASURED BY NEUTROPHIL AND LYMPHOCYTE COUNT (P<0.05). DISCUSSION: ALL ANALGESICS, HYPNOTICS, AND MUSCLE RELAXANTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PENTOTHAL, MAY REDUCE LYMPHOCYTES, PARTICULARLY CELLS. AN INCREASE IN NEUTROPHIL LEVELS COULD OCCUR WHEN INTRAVENOUS ANESTHETICS ARE GIVEN POSTOPERATIVELY."

"WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE CONCEPT OF TERMINAL ANOREXIA NERVOSA IS BEING CONSIDERED IN SERIOUS DISCUSSION. OUR PREVIOUS PRESENTATIONS WERE NOT INTENDED TO ASSESS EATING DISORDERS CARE BROADLY, BUT SOLELY TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF END-OF-LIFE CARE ISSUES FOR PATIENTS WITH ANOREXIA NERVOSA. REGARDLESS OF DIFFERENCES IN ABILITY TO ACCESS OR UTILIZE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES, INESCAPABLY, INDIVIDUALS CONTENDING WITH END-STAGE MALNUTRITION DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA WHO REFUSE FURTHER NUTRITION WILL PROGRESSIVELY DECLINE, AND SOME WILL DIE AS A RESULT. OUR DESCRIPTION OF THESE PATIENTS' LAST DAYS AND WEEKS AS ``TERMINAL'' AND MERITING THOUGHTFUL END-OF-LIFE CARE IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE TERM IS USED IN OTHER END-STAGE TERMINAL CONDITIONS. WE CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PRECISE DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR END-OF-LIFE CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS SHOULD BE DEVELOPED BY THE EATING DISORDER AND PALLIATIVE CARE FIELDS. AVOIDING THE PHRASE ``TERMINAL ANOREXIA NERVOSA'' WILL NOT MAKE THESE PHENOMENA DISAPPEAR. WE ARE SORRY THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE UPSET BY THIS CONCEPT. OUR INTENTION IS CERTAINLY NOT TO DEMORALIZE BY ``TRIGGERING'' FEARS OF HOPELESSNESS OR DEATH. BUT THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL INEVITABLY DISTRESS SOME PEOPLE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CONSIDERING THESE ISSUES MIGHT WELL BENEFIT FROM FURTHER EXPLORATIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR CLINICIANS AND OTHERS. FINALLY, WE CLEARLY APPLAUD EXPANDING TREATMENT OPTIONS AND AVAILABILITY, AND WE STRONGLY ADVOCATE FOR MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE EVERY PATIENT EVERY POSSIBLE OPTION FOR TREATMENT AND RECOVERY AT EVERY PHASE OF THEIR STRUGGLES."

"AT PRESENT, THE NEED TO MAKE USE OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE MATERIALS IS INCREASING DUE TO THEIR HARMFUL EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. IN THE PRESENT WORK, THE BEHAVIOR OF HYBRID REINFORCED T-BEAM WITH PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION RECYCLED RUBBERIZED CONCRETE IS STUDIED. THE FINITE ELEMENT MODELING BY USING ANSYS VERSION 15 PROGRAM. IT CONTAINS ALSO ALL THE REQUIRED STEPS NEEDED TO CREATE THE CONCRETE MODELS THAT WERE PREPARED TO STUDY THE BEHAVIOR OF BEAMS WITH PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION RECYCLED RUBBERIZED CONCRETE (RRC). THE REINFORCEMENT OF BEAMS WAS VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF POLYMER GFRP AND STEEL BARS. THE RUBBERIZED CONCRETE MIXES WERE PREPARED BY PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION 7.5 \%, 10 \%, AND 12.5 \% REPLACEMENTS BY VOLUME. THE RATIO OF GFRP TO STEEL REINFORCEMENT AT MID-SPAN SECTION WAS THE SECOND PARAMETER INVESTIGATED. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS AFFECTING THE BEHAVIOR OF HYBRID REINFORCED T- BEAM WITH PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION RECYCLED RUBBERIZED CONCRETE, AN EXTENSIVE PARAMETRIC STUDY WAS PERFORMED USING ANSYS VERSION 15 PROGRAM. THREE PARAMETERS WERE INVESTIGATED NAMELY; BOTTOM RFT, COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE, AND THE EXISTENCE OF OPENING. THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS AGREE WELL WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN TERMS OF MODE OF FAILURE AND THE FAILURE LOAD VALUES. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ALTHOUGH THE FLEXURAL CAPACITY OF THE TESTED SPECIMEN DECREASED WITH THE ADDITION OF CRUMB RUBBER AND REDUCED ITS SELF-WEIGHT. THE FAILURE LOAD OF THE BEAM WITH PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION RECYCLED RUBBERIZED CONCRETE INCREASES WITH BOTTOM REINFORCEMENT BY THE GFRP BAR OR CFRP BAR. ALSO, REINFORCED BEAMS BY CFRP BARS HAD A HIGHER FAILURE LOAD THAN REINFORCED BEAMS BY GFRP BARS. HAVING AN OPENING IN HYBRID REINFORCED T-BEAM WITH PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION RECYCLED RUBBERIZED CONCRETE REDUCED THE BEAM LOAD CAPACITY AND MAXIMUM DEFLECTION. ALSO, USING GFRP BARS, AND CFRP BARS IN THE VICINITY OF OPENINGS IN HYBRID REINFORCED T-BEAMS INCREASED THE LOAD CAPACITY OF THESE BEAMS."

"THE EJECTION MECHANISM OF TRANSIENT RELATIVISTIC JETS FROM BLACK HOLE BINARIES IS STUDIED. BASED ON OBSERVATIONS OF THE LIMIT-CYCLE BEHAVIORS OF THE SUPERLUMINAL JET SOURCE GRS 1915+105, WE INFER THAT TRANSIENT JET EJECTIONS COULD HAPPEN JUST AFTER THE SLIM DISK EMERGING FROM THE STANDARD DISK AT SOME DISTANCE RUNS OVER THE STANDARD DISK AND REACHES THE VICINITY OF THE CENTRAL BLACK HOLE. THE STANDARD DISK RELEASES ABOUT HALF OF THE GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY IN THE COURSE OF THE ACCRETION, BUT THE RELEASED RADIATIVE ENERGY COULD BE ABSORBED BY THE OPTICALLY THICK SLIM DISK COVERING THE STANDARD DISK IN THIS SITUATION. THEN, SINCE THE INWARD MOTION OF THE SLIM DISK IS MUCH FASTER THAN THAT OF THE STANDARD DISK, A QUANTITY OF ENERGY RELEASED BY AN AMOUNT OF GAS IN THE STANDARD DISK IS RECEIVED BY THE MUCH SMALLER AMOUNT OF GAS IN THE SLIM DISK. AS A RESULT, THE ENERGY PER MASS RECEIVED BY THE SLIM DISK IS EXPECTED TO BE GREATLY AMPLIFIED AND IS ESTIMATED TO BECOME HIGHLY RELATIVISTIC. SINCE THE ENERGY IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY, THE HEIGHT OF THE SLIM DISK COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. HENCE, THE INNERMOST PART OF THE SLIM DISK FROM WHICH ALMOST ALL THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED OUTWARD COULD HAVE A MUCH LARGER HEIGHT THAN THE BLACK HOLE SIZE, SO THEY COULD COLLIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER AROUND THE CENTRAL AXIS OF THE DISK, TURNING TO AN OUTWARD FLOW ALONG THE AXIS NORMAL TO THE DISK PLANE. THE FLOW IN THIS DIRECTION CAN BE APPROXIMATED TO BE THAT THROUGH THE DE LAVAL NOZZLE AND COULD BECOME SUPERSONIC NEAR THE DISTANCE WHERE THE FLOW HAS THE SMALLEST CROSS-SECTION."

SHE SUFFERED FROM BLURRED VISION, PHOTOPHOBIA AND OCULAR PAIN OF BOTH EYES AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF THE REGIMEN FOR 5 MONTHS. SLIT-LAMP BIOMICROSCOPY WITH FLUORESCEIN STAINING REVEALED IRREGULAR EPITHELIUM AT THE UPPER 1/3 CORNEA.

"BACKGROUND: AS FACE MASKS BECAME MANDATORY IN MOST COUNTRIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ADVERSE EFFECTS REQUIRE SUBSTANTIATED INVESTIGATION. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF 2,168 STUDIES ON ADVERSE MEDICAL MASK EFFECTS YIELDED 54 PUBLICATIONS FOR SYNTHESIS AND 37 STUDIES FOR META-ANALYSIS (ON N = 8,641, M = 2,482, F = 6,159, AGE = 34.8 +/- 12.5). THE MEDIAN TRIAL DURATION WAS ONLY 18 MIN (IQR = 50) FOR OUR COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF MASK INDUCED PHYSIO-METABOLIC AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN BOTH MEDICAL SURGICAL AND N95 MASKS, WITH A GREATER IMPACT OF THE SECOND. THESE EFFECTS INCLUDED DECREASED SPO(2) (OVERALL STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE, SMD = -0.24, 95\% CI = -0.38 TO -0.11, P < 0.001) AND MINUTE VENTILATION (SMD = -0.72, 95\% CI = -0.99 TO -0.46, P < 0.001), SIMULTANEOUS INCREASED IN BLOOD-CO2 (SMD = +0.64, 95\% CI = 0.31-0.96, P < 0.001), HEART RATE (N95: SMD = +0.22, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.41, P = 0.02), SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SURGICAL: SMD = +0.21, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.39, P = 0.02), SKIN TEMPERATURE (OVERALL SMD = +0.80 95\% CI = 0.23-1.38, P = 0.006) AND HUMIDITY (SMD +2.24, 95\% CI = 1.32-3.17, P < 0.001). EFFECTS ON EXERTION (OVERALL SMD=+0.9, SURGICAL=+0.63, N95 =+1.19), DISCOMFORT (SMD=+1.16), DYSPNOEA (SMD = +1.46), HEAT (SMD = +0.70), AND HUMIDITY (SMD = +0.9) WERE SIGNIFICANT IN N = 373 WITH A ROBUST RELATIONSHIP TOMASK WEARING (P < 0.006 TO P < 0.001). POOLED SYMPTOM PREVALENCE (N = 8,128) WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR: HEADACHE (62\%, P < 0.001), ACNE (38\%, P < 0.001), SKIN IRRITATION (36\%, P < 0.001), DYSPNOEA (33\%, P < 0.001), HEAT (26\%, P < 0.001), ITCHING (26\%, P < 0.001), VOICE DISORDER (23\%, P < 0.03), AND DIZZINESS (5\%, P = 0.01). DISCUSSION: MASKS INTERFERED WITH O-2-UPTAKE AND CO2-RELEASE AND COMPROMISED RESPIRATORY COMPENSATION. THOUGH EVALUATED WEARING DURATIONS ARE SHORTER THAN DAILY/PROLONGED USE, OUTCOMES INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATE MASK-INDUCED EXHAUSTION-SYNDROME (MIES) AND DOWN-STREAM PHYSIO-METABOLIC DISFUNCTIONS. MIES CAN HAVE LONG-TERM CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES, ESPECIALLY FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS. SO FAR, SEVERAL MASK RELATED SYMPTOMS MAY HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED AS LONG COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. IN ANY CASE, THE POSSIBLE MIES CONTRASTS WITH THE WHO DEFINITION OF HEALTH. CONCLUSION: FACE MASK SIDE-EFFECTS MUST BE ASSESSED (RISK-BENEFIT) AGAINST THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST VIRAL TRANSMISSIONS. IN THE ABSENCE OF STRONG EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS, MASK WEARING SHOULD NOT BE MANDATED LET ALONE ENFORCED BY LAW.
