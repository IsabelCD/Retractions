Title = {RETRACTED: Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria: Parent Reports on 1655 Possible
   Cases (Retracted article. See JUN, 2023)},

Abstract = {During the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in adolescents
   and young adults (AYA) complaining of gender dysphoria. One influential
   if controversial explanation is that the increase reflects a socially
   contagious syndrome: Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD). We report
   results from a survey of parents who contacted the website
   ParentsofROGDKids.com because they believed their AYA children had ROGD.
   Results focused on 1655 AYA children whose gender dysphoria reportedly
   began between ages 11 and 21 years, inclusive. These youths were
   disproportionately (75\%) natal female. Natal males had later onset (by
   1.9 years) than females, and they were much less likely to have taken
   steps toward social gender transition (65.7\% for females versus 28.6\%
   for males). Pre-existing mental health issues were common, and youths
   with these issues were more likely than those without them to have
   socially and medically transitioned. Parents reported that they had
   often felt pressured by clinicians to affirm their AYA child's new
   gender and support their transition. According to the parents, AYA
   children's mental health deteriorated considerably after social
   transition. We discuss potential biases of survey responses from this
   sample and conclude that there is presently no reason to believe that
   reports of parents who support gender transition are more accurate than
   those who oppose transition. To resolve controversies regarding ROGD, it
   is desirable that future research includes data provided by both pro-
   and anti-transition parents, as well as their gender dysphoric AYA
   children.},

Abstract = {The above article from the Journal of Neurochemistry, published online
   on 14 July 2015 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), and in
   Volume 135, pp. 332-346, has been retracted by agreement between the
   authors, Kalpana Barhwal, Saroj K. Das, Ashish Kumar, Sunil K. Hota,
   Ravi B. Srivastava, and John Wiley and Sons Ltd. The retraction has been
   agreed upon concerns raised by a third party following the admission of
   Sunil K. Hota that this article contained data that cannot be retrieved
   and verified. During the investigation, several inconsistencies were
   found. In Figure 4a, the two bands in the red boxed areas appeared
   similar, and there was unexpected placement of top bands with respect to
   the lower smears, and a sharp vertical transition between lanes. In
   Figure 4b and 4d, similarities were observed between the boxed areas
   highlighted in the same color. In Figure 5a, the immunoblots appeared to
   have repeated features. In Figure 6a, repetitive patterns were observed
   in the bottom right panel. In Figure 6b, the lanes appeared similar in
   the GADPH panel. These issues called the conclusions of the manuscript
   into question. Accordingly, the conclusions of this manuscript are
   considered substantially compromised. Reference Barhwal, K., Das, S. K.,

   and Sirtuin 1 synergistically improve learning and spatial memory

Title = {RETRACTED: A comparative study on end-to-end deep learning methods for
   Electroencephalogram channel selection (Retracted article. See vol. 122,
   2023)},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},

Abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) channel selection approach with deep
   neural networks enables us to fit the channel selection to the goal
   model without dealing with the high processing expenses associated with
   wrapper methods for an efficient, integrated brain-computer interface
   (BCIs) study. An end-to-end deep learning-based methodology is proposed
   in this work to choose the proper channels for BCI paradigms. The EEG
   channel selection and network parameters are optimized using a concrete
   selector layer. The Gumbel-softmax approach is used in this layer to
   include the discrete parameters involved in the selection process into
   continuous relaxations, allowing for end-to-end backpropagation learning
   of the parameters. This study suggests a regularization method to reduce
   this tendency, as the selection layer is frequently shown to include the
   same channel twice in a particular selection. We performed six models
   using the suggested framework, and our proposed study, MSFBCNN+LSTM,
   extracts significant and robust properties compared to other models. For
   verification, high gamma dataset is used for each model to investigate
   and observe good accuracy. Overall, the MSFBCNN+LSTM architecture has
   the maximum classification mean accuracy of 90.59\% in the specified
   tasks. This paper suggests that using integrated architectures of deep
   learning model learns the best features and contributes to BCI's
   performance.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Sexual reproductive health service utilization and associated
   factors among undergraduate students of Addis Ababa University in
   Ethiopia (Retracted article. See vol. 42, 2023)},

Abstract = {BackgroundMaking clinical services attractive to the younger generation
   has remained a challenge. Students in higher education continue to
   underutilize sexual and reproductive health services. This group is
   exposed to a very hostile environment and has a highly mobile and
   unprotected lifestyle, often resulting in an early sexual debut,
   physical and drug abuse, and sexually transmitted
   infections.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to assess sexual
   reproductive health services and associated factors among undergraduate
   students of Addis Ababa University 2022.MethodAn Institution-based
   cross-sectional study was been conducted among 419 randomly selected
   students and data were collected by using semi-structured and pre-tested
   questionnaire. Data were entered to Epi info data 7.0 and exported to
   SPSS version 21.0 for further analysis. Both binary and multiple
   logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors at P < 0.05
   with 95\% CI and AOR.ResultsWhen queried, all 419 youths agreed to
   participate in the study, for a response rate of 100\%. The mean age of
   the respondents was 22 years. The majority of respondents (371, 88.5\%)
   were between the ages of 19 and 24, and 221 (52.7\%) were female. More
   than half of those polled (273, or 65.2\%) were third-year students,
   while 59, or 14.1\%, were first-year students. About 206 (49.2\%) of
   participants lived with their father and mother, but 138 (32.9\%) had
   never discussed sexual and reproductive health. Finally, 205 respondents
   (or 48.9\%) had ever used the Sexual and Reproductive Health Services.
   College of business (AOR (95\% CI) 3.546 (1.62-7.79), respondents who
   live with only their mother (AOR (95\% CI) 9.37 (2.78-31.51) and who
   live alone (AOR (95\% CI) 5.75 (2.40-13.79), positive attitude toward
   SRHS (AOR (95\% CI) 3.15 (1.71-5.80), good knowledge (AOR (95\% CI) 4.16
   (2.27-7.64), frequency of discussing SRHS(AOR (95\% CI) 1.93
   (1.12-3.346), Convenient location of youth RHs (AOR (95\% CI) 8.31
   (1.61-42.93), Fee of RH services (AOR (95\% CI) 12.34 (6.48-23.49) and
   Satisfied to received RH services (AOR (95\% CI) 4.59 (2.54-8.33) were
   independent predictors of utilized SRHS among undergraduate
   students.Conclusion and recommendationThe prevalence of utilization of
   sexual and reproductive health services was determined to be low in this
   study, with identified factors increasing the likelihood of utilization
   being attitude, knowledge, satisfaction, discussion, fee for RH
   services, and location, in that order. On the other hand, poor knowledge
   and a negative attitude toward SRHS posed risks that contributed to
   reproductive health issues, so we worked on advocating for services that
   were available in a nearby location and raising awareness. Therefore,
   policymakers and health planners would be better off strengthening the
   urgent need to ensure adequate SRHS, knowledge, and attitude building
   among undergraduate students in higher education in Ethiopia.},

Abstract = {Concerns regarding data integrity, which were based on a PubPeer thread
   showing similarities among western blots and an illustration in this
   article and articles published by unrelated authors, were raised by the
   National Science Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://
   pubpeer.com/publications/2725A85FAC4C3C4037896AAC7C21E7). The authors
   provided original data in response to the editorial office???s
   investigation request. The original western blot images provided by the
   authors confirmed editing of the blots. The text and figures of the
   article show signs of template use, with marked similarities between
   this article and articles by unrelated authors, such as ???The Potential
   Therapeutic Role of Exosomal MicroRNA-520b Derived from Normal
   Fibroblasts in Pancreatic Cancer??? (Shi et al., 2020, Mol. Ther.
   Nucleic Acids 20, 373-384, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2019.12.029)
   and ???Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomal
   MicroRNA-126-3p Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Development by Targeting
   ADAM9??? (Wu et al., 2019, Mol. Ther. Nucleic Acids 16, 229-245,
   https://doi.org/10.1016/j. omtn.2019.02.022). Given these issues, the
   editors believe that the findings of the manuscript cannot be relied
   upon. The authors disagree with the retraction.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Development of carbon dots to manage Alzheimer?s disease and
   Parkinson?s disease (Retracted article. See vol. 146, 2023)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE TAIWAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) in the central nervous
   system are characterized through a pro-gressive loss of neural structure
   due to the synthesis of abnormal extracellular and intracellular
   proteins, such as misfolded beta-amyloid peptide (A beta), entangled tau
   protein and aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). Various
   nano-materials thrived to overcome these pathobiological problems.
   However, most of the approaches achieved limited success in clinical
   trials, partly owing to the obstruction in pharmaceutical transfer
   across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during diagnosis and
   therapy.Methods: Hence, inventing brain-targeted biomaterials for
   simultaneous detection and treatment for NDs has become an essential
   demand in medical practice. Carbon dots (CDs) attracted particular
   attention by biomedical researchers in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   Parkinson's disease (PD) management because of their small size,
   superior physicochemical properties, excellent photostability, tunable
   surface functionality, apposite biode-gradability, noninvasiveness, and
   high ability to penetrate the BBB and upgraded targeting
   efficacy.Significant findings: In this review, we deliberated the
   capacity of innovated CDs to sustain drug delivery with deep bioimaging
   nature, permeate the BBB, disaggregate A beta and alpha-syn fibrils with
   transformed secondary structure, repress acetylcholinesterase activity,
   lessen synaptic loss for rescuing neurons from apoptosis, and alleviate
   AD and PD symptoms with promoted cognitive and mobile function. We also
   discussed the restrictions and questions that remain, and the future
   perspective of CDs for ND treatment.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Influence of indoor relative humidity on the number
   concentration, size distribution, and trajectory of sneeze droplets:
   Effects on social distancing guidelines (Retracted article. See vol.
   166, 2023)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {163},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is mainly due to the direct
   transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 virus -carrying aerosols in indoor
   environments. In this study, the effect of indoor relative humidity (RH
   infinity) on the number concentration, size distribution, and trajectory
   of sneeze droplets was studied in a confined space experimentally and
   numerically. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the
   renormalization group k-epsilon turbulence model by considering the
   one-way and two-way (humidity) coupling models were per-formed to assess
   the effects of humidity fields on the propagation of droplets. Number
   concentration profiles indicated that the RH infinity affected the
   dispersion modes of droplets differently for the puff, droplet cloud,
   fully -dispersed, and dilute-dispersed droplets phases identified by the
   shadowgraph imaging technique. The two-way (humidity) coupling model led
   to a close agreement with the experimental data in all phases. In
   partic-ular, the two-way coupling provided better agreement with the
   data in the puff phase compared to the one-way coupling model. However,
   the one-way coupling model was sufficient for studying the motion of
   airborne droplets in the other phases. The velocity fields in the
   droplet cloud were more sensitive to RH infinity than the puff and
   fully-dispersed droplets phases. Also, the effect of RH infinity on the
   maximum spreading distance of droplets, dmax,sp, in the puff was
   insignificant, while its effect became dominant in the dilute-dispersed
   droplets phase. A dynamic change in the velocity profile of the sneeze
   jet was seen at a critical relative humidity RH infinity,crit of about
   48\%. At RH infinity< RH infinity,crit, the number concentration of
   aerosolized droplets increases, significantly affecting the size
   dis-tribution and the velocity of droplets. At RH infinity >= RH
   infinity,crit, the effect of evaporation time on the number
   con-centration, and diameter of droplets was negligible. At RH infinity
   of 24 and 64\%, dmax,sp was 2.14 m (7 feet) and 3.05 m (10 feet),
   respectively. However, a dry indoor environment led to an increase in
   evaporation rate and more than four times number concentration of
   aerosolized droplets compared to a humid environment. Thus, the risk of
   direct transmission of Covid-19 in a humid indoor environment was higher
   than the dry conditions, which suggested the requirements for
   incorporating the RH infinity effect in the social distancing guideline.},

   exception of Brian T. Larsen who could not be reached), the journal's
   Editor in Chief, Andrew Lawrence, and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. The

Title = {RETRACTED: Smart logistics with IoT-based enterprise management system
   using global manufacturing (Retracted article. See vol. 45, 2023)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Smart logistics will encourage replacing manual systems with the
   Internet of Things (IoT) or automated handling equipment taking care of
   repetitive tasks in the enterprise management system. Opportunities to
   address the issues arise from the development of smart logistics. When
   used with other quantitative analytic tools and techniques, today's IoT
   may generate vast amounts of data and reveal intricate correlations
   between the many transactions represented by that data. Smart logistics
   can benefit from the inclusion of these features. The complication and
   variety of consumer orders necessitate a change in warehouse operations.
   There is a need for real-time data and contextual data on highly
   tailored orders' large diversity and small batch sizes. To achieve
   on-time order fulfilment, the synchronization of purchase orders to
   support production is critical to the frequent changes in customer
   needs. Order fulfilment suffers as a result of inefficient and erroneous
   order selection. Computational intelligence techniques are used in the
   research to provide an advanced data analysis methodology for Industry
   4.0's smart logistics through global manufacturing. Advanced data
   analysis methods for Industry 4.0's smart logistics are developed using
   computational intelligence approaches. However, IoT-SL can increase
   logistics productivity, picking accuracy, and efficiency based on data
   obtained from a case firm and is resilient to order unpredictability.
   Smart contracts, logistics planners, and asset condition monitoring are
   included in the paper's smart logistics system. A prototype solution is
   implemented to demonstrate responsibility, traceability, and obligation
   for asset management across the supply chain by multiple stakeholders
   participating in a logistics scenario. It is important to look at how
   IoT technologies are being used in the smart logistics industry from
   transportation, storage, loading/unloading, carrying, distributed
   processing and information transfer, thereby achieving real-time
   monitoring, increased logistics productivity, logistics management,
   increased delivery of goods and efficiency of 98.3\%.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Cable tunnel unmanned aerial vehicle location and navigation

Journal = {IET ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IN TRANSPORTATION},

Abstract = {With the increasing demand for electric energy, more and more cities are
   constructing cable tunnels. In order to prevent the cable in the tunnel
   from being damaged, regular inspection of the cable tunnel is very
   important. However, due to the large scale of cable tunnel construction,
   the traditional manual inspection is difficult to meet the maintenance
   requirements. With the development of intelligent technology, the
   intelligent patrol mode of UAV has gradually replaced the traditional
   manual patrol mode and become the main patrol mode of cable tunnel.
   Therefore, the positioning and navigation method of cable tunnel UAV is
   studied in this paper. By using UWB localization algorithm and depth
   camera fusion, the positioning and navigation methods of UAVs are
   determined and compared with the positioning algorithm based on optical
   flow. Experimental comparison results show that the maximum and minimum
   yaw angles of UAV positioning based on the proposed algorithm are 2.41
   degrees and 0.16 degrees, while the maximum and minimum yaw angles of
   UAV positioning based on the comparison algorithm are 3.11 degrees and
   1.51 degrees. It can be seen that the integration of UWB and depth
   camera is of great significance for the research of positioning and
   navigation methods of cable tunnel UAVs.},

Abstract = {Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterised by increased
   intracranial pressure of unknown aetiology. It is usually seen among
   obese women who are of childbearing age. With an incidence of 0.9 per
   100,000 in women of childbearing age, the incidence in obese women is as
   high as 19.3 per 100,000. Here, we represent the case of a 31-year-old,
   non-obese primigravida with hypothyroidism which was diagnosed as
   idiopathic intracranial hypertension during pregnancy. This patient, was
   managed with multi-disciplinary considerations so as to avoid
   complications in perioperative period.},

Abstract = {This article has been retracted: Aging has completed its investigation
   of this paper. The investigation found that the text and figures overlap
   with an article by different authors published in another journal {[}1],
   which has already been retracted. The Figure 1C ???sham??? image is
   identical with ???TAC??? image in Figure 2C from the Aging paper and the
   Figure 2E ???TAC??? image from the aforementioned other paper {[}1]. Two
   additional panels of Figure 2C also are identical to two panels of
   Figure 2E in the other paper {[}1]. Figure 2B - H\&E staining of the
   heart tissue - bottom panels ???TAC??? and ???TAC+Ad-AK045171??? are
   identical with the bottom ???TAC??? and ???sham??? images of Figure 4F
   of the other paper {[}1]. The authors informed the journal that they
   have agreed with the retraction.},

Abstract = {Terra rossa soils on the Istrian peninsula are generally considered
   polygenetic relict soils. They overlie and mark the youngest subaerial
   unconformity in the northwestern part of the Adriatic Carbonate Platform
   and are sus-ceptible to erosional and redepositional processes. Terra
   rossa soils represent a valuable archive of information that can be used
   to understand present and past soil formation processes in the context
   of climate variability and landscape dynamics, especially in low-lying
   parts of the karst landscape where thicker deposits are typically found.
   We studied a 3 m thick terra rossa profile in a karst depression on the
   northernmost part of the south-western Istrian planation surface and
   analysed the micromorphology, physical/chemical properties,
   geochem-istry, bulk and clay mineralogy, and composition of heavy and
   light mineral fractions. The profile shows several signs of colluviation
   and polygenesis with clay distribution along the profile, clearly
   indicating lithic disconti-nuities. Kaolinization, along with iron oxide
   formation, is the dominant process in the studied profile.
   Ferrali-tization and lessivage processes were diagnosed throughout the
   profile, with intense clay translocation occurring despite the extremely
   stable soil microaggregates. In accordance with the WRB system, the
   profile is classified as Lixic Rhodic Ferralsol (Clayic, Aric). This
   implies that some terra rossa soils, previously classified as e.g.
   Cam-bisols or Luvisols, might actually be Ferralsols or other tropical
   soils (e.g. Lixisols), in which relict properties are preserved in the
   present climate. The finding of a Ferralsol in the study area indicates
   the old age of the surface of the karst depression and provides the
   first data on the burial history of the southwestern Istrian planation
   sur-face. We suggest the older Quaternary interglacials, the
   mid-Piacenzian Warm Period (Pliocene) and the Miocene Climatic Optimum
   as favourable periods for the formation of the studied soil.},

Title = {RETRACTED: METTL3 enhances the effect of YTHDF1 on NEDD1 mRNA stability

Abstract = {AimDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains the most frequent
   subpopulation of lymphoma, and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) was implicated
   in the DLBCL progression. Herein, we sought to decipher the
   m6A-asociated mechanism of NEDD1 in DLBCL development. MethodsThe NEDD1
   expression profile in DLBCL was assessed by quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. NEDD1 was
   artificially downregulated or upregulated in DLBCL cells, followed by
   EdU, Transwell assays and flow cytometry. The Hedgehog pathway activity
   was assayed by a dual-luciferase assay. The m6A methylation of NEDD1 in
   DLBCL was assessed by meRIP-qPCR, and the regulatory mechanism of METTL3
   on NEDD1 was validated. The LDH assay was conducted to examine the
   impact of CD8(+) T cells on DLBCL cells. The DLBCL cells were
   administrated into mice to evaluate the tumorigenic activity and ki-67
   activity in tumor tissues. ResultsNEDD1 was overexpressed in DLBCL.
   Depletion of NEDD1 inhibited the aggressiveness of SU-DHL-8 and OCI-LY1
   cells, whereas overexpression of NEDD1 expedited the aggressiveness of
   SU-DHL-8 and OCI-LY1 cells. METTL3 promoted NEDD1 translation in an
   m6A-dependent manner via YTHDF1. Depletion of METTL3 inhibited SU-DHL-8
   and OCI-LY1 cell activity through regulation of NEDD1. NEDD1 reversed
   the repressive effect of METTL3 loss on the aggressiveness of SU-DHL-8
   and OCI-LY1 cells. NEDD1 activated the Hedgehog signaling to promote
   immune escape of DLBCL. ConclusionsMETTL3 promotes translation of NEDD1
   via YTHDF1-depedndent m6A modification, thereby activating the Hedgehog
   signaling pathway to promote immune escape of DLBCL cells.},

Abstract = {Barium strontium titanate (Ba1-xSrxTiO3) is a novel material that has
   significantly contributed to most electronic industries. Ba1-xSrxTiO3 is
   synthesized by a new sol-gel method with a different composition (x =
   0.3 to 0.6). (Ba, Sr) acetate is a source of (Ba+2, Sr+2 ions) and
   titanate isopropoxide is a source of Ti+4. The particle size of each
   sample was revealed by FESEM images, showing a reduction from 197 to 46
   nm when the x ratio increased from 0.3 to 0.6. The X-ray diffraction
   revealed the phases of all the samples. Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 appeared as a
   tetragonal phase. The remaining samples were shown to be in the cubic
   phase. As the concentration of Sr+2 ions rose, the major peak intensity
   decreased, and its angles changed. The dielectric constant was
   investigated for all samples. It was studied as a function of
   temperature and frequencies. The dielectric constant was higher for the
   x = 0.3 sample than the remaining ratio. The optical constant was
   investigated. The energy bandgap was decreased with an increase in Sr+2
   ions and transmittance, and absorbance also varied with increases in
   Sr+2 ions.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Direct Extubation to High-Flow Nasal Cannula versus

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients who are obese have a higher risk of acute
   respiratory failure after extubation in the ICU. This study aimed to
   compare the extubation of subjects who were critically ill and obese to
   high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) versus noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to
   determine whether HFNC can aid in reducing postextubation respiratory
   failure and the re-intubation rate. METHODS: In this randomized
   controlled trial, subjects who were obese, defined as individuals with a
   body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2), were randomly assigned to receive HFNC (n
   5 60) versus 60 subjects treated with NIV applied immediately after
   extubation. The primary outcome was the inci-dence of postextubation
   respiratory failure and re-intubation rate within 72 h. Secondary
   outcomes included oxygenation, breathing frequency, subjective dyspnea,
   ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU mortality at day 28. RESULTS:
   Compared with NIV, HFNC reduced the risk of respiratory fail-ure by
   8.4\%, 95\% CI 6.2-12.8\%. Even though the rate of re-intubation was
   lower in the HFNC group versus in the NIV group, no statistical
   significance was observed (11.6\% vs 16.6\%; difference 5\%, 95\% CI
   2.5\%-8.2\%). In 48-h periods and 72 h after extubation, the mean
   P-aO2/F-IO2 significantly increased in the HFNC group compared with the
   NIV group. Both groups had low dyspnea levels 72 h after extuba-tion. No
   difference was detected between the groups in breathing frequency. In
   addition, the 2 groups had no significant difference in ICU and hospital
   length of stay. The HFNC and NIV groups had com-parable hospital
   mortality rates. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed
   the presence of severe obesity, comorbidities, a higher severity score,
   and hypercapnia remained as factors associated with an increased risk of
   re-intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Postextubation application of HFNC may
   prevent respiratory failure in patients who are obese.

Title = {RETRACTED: The role of social circle COVID-19 illness and vaccination
   experiences in COVID-19 vaccination decisions: an online survey of the
   United States population (Retracted article. See vol. 23, 2023)},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {BackgroundAround the world, policymakers have clearly communicated that
   COVID-19 vaccination programs need to be accepted by a large proportion
   of the population to allow life return to normal. However, according to
   the Center for Disease Control, about 31\% of the United States
   population had not completed the primary vaccination series as of
   November 2022.AimsThe primary aim of this work is to identify the
   factors associated by American citizens with the decision to be
   vaccinated against COVID-19. In addition, the proportion of fatal events
   from COVID-19 vaccinations was estimated and compared with the data in
   the VAERS database.MethodsAn online survey of COVID-19 health
   experiences was conducted. Information was collected regarding reasons
   for and against COVID-19 inoculations, experiences with COVID-19 illness
   and COVID-19 inoculations by survey respondents and their social
   circles. Logit regression analyses were carried out to identify factors
   influencing the likelihood of being vaccinated.ResultsA total of 2840
   participants completed the survey between December 18 and 23, 2021. 51\%
   (1383 of 2840) of the participants were female and the mean age was 47
   (95\% CI 46.36-47.64) years. Those who knew someone who experienced a
   health problem from COVID-19 were more likely to be vaccinated (OR:
   1.309, 95\% CI 1.094-1.566), while those who knew someone who
   experienced a health problem following vaccination were less likely to
   be vaccinated (OR: 0.567, 95\% CI 0.461-0.698). 34\% (959 of 2840)
   reported that they knew at least one person who had experienced a
   significant health problem due to the COVID-19 illness. Similarly, 22\%
   (612 of 2840) of respondents indicated that they knew at least one
   person who had experienced a severe health problem following COVID-19
   vaccination. With these survey data, the total number of fatalities due
   to COVID-19 inoculation may be as high as 278,000 (95\% CI
   217,330-332,608) when fatalities that may have occurred regardless of
   inoculation are removed.ConclusionKnowing someone who reported serious
   health issues either from COVID-19 or from COVID-19 vaccination are
   important factors for the decision to get vaccinated. The large
   difference in the possible number of fatalities due to COVID-19
   vaccination that emerges from this survey and the available governmental
   data should be further investigated.},

Abstract = {Computer vision is a reliable and cutting-edge method of processing
   images, yielding desirable results and holding great promise. Many other
   industries, including agriculture, have begun making heavy use of
   computer vision. Implications for the study of agricultural processes
   through the application of image processing methods are quite promising.
   Existing works are only focused on disease categorisation of
   agricultural productions. They have focused only on feature descriptor,
   mathematical framework or identifying healthy fruits and vegetables with
   accuracy. While transformers have seen research for agricultural
   applications, deep CNNs and transformers working together have not been
   explored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of using a
   multi-model deep learning network (MMDL) for complicated picture
   categorisation by combining a tweaked version of the popular deep CNN
   system VGG-16 with a 3D CNN network and a Swin transformer. To increase
   the precision of MMDL, African Buffalo Optimisation(ABO) is employed to
   identify healthy fruits and vegetables. The experiments are conducted
   using datasets that are freely accessible to the public and evaluated
   using a number of different criteria. Proposed method has shown more
   accuracy and recall than the existing methods.},

   (Retracted article. See JUN, 2023)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VASCULAR ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 23},
Abstract = {Vascular access devices (VADs) are common and essential in the
   healthcare setting. However, several factors influence VAD selection and
   management. Wide variations in VAD practices and the degree of VAD
   awareness are noted across Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries. An
   international panel was convened that applied the ASA 2020 method to
   develop standard criteria for use of VADs in the APAC region. After a
   literature search, scenarios related to VAD use, care, and maintenance
   were developed according to the patient population, indication for
   insertion, and duration of use. These scenarios were rated on a scale of
   1-5 (1 being strongly disagreed and 5 strongly agreed) by 11 expert
   members. A total of 48 clinical scenarios were developed: 23 in
   hospitalized patients, 3 in critical patients, 4 in cancer settings, 7
   pertinent to VAD placement, and 11 for VAD maintenance. The
   multidisciplinary panel generated several recommendations for the use,
   care, and management of VADs across general hospitalized patients with
   or without difficult venous access, critically ill patients, patients
   with malignancy, patients with different stages of chronic kidney
   disease (CKD) with or without dialysis, and in other special populations
   through evidence-based standards. These recommendations may help in
   achieving uniformity in practice patterns and improving the quality of
   VAD care and quality of life of patients in APAC region.},

   Since neural networks have more layers, it is possible to solve the

   with differentiable layers is predictable as its state can be predicted
   and its solutions can be determined using minimum loss functions.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Review novel insights into the diagnostic and prognostic

Abstract = {As is shown in previous reports, arginine vasopressin (AVP), as one of
   the most important hormones within circulation in human beings, is of
   great clinically significance given that it could maintain the body
   fluid balance and vascular tone. However, the laboratory measurements
   AVP in daily clinical practice are shown to be difficult and with low
   accuracy. Concerning on this notion, it is unpractical to use the serum
   levels of AVP in diagnosing multiple diseases. On the other hand,
   another key serum biomarker, copeptin, is confirmed as the C-terminal of
   the AVP precursor which could be released in equal amounts with AVP,
   resultantly making it as a sensitive marker of arginine vasopressin
   release. Notably, emerging recent evidence has demonstrated the critical
   function of copeptin as a clinical indicator, especially in the
   diagnosis and prognosis of several diseases in diverse organs, such as
   cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and pulmonary disease. In
   addition, copeptin was recently verified to play an important role in
   diagnosing multiple acute diseases when combined it with other gold
   standard serum biomarkers, indicating that copeptin could be recognized
   as a vital disease marker. Herein, in the current review, the functions
   of copeptin as a new predictive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of
   various diseases, according to the most recent studies, are well
   summarized. Furthermore, the importance of using copeptin as a serum
   biomarker in diverse medical departments and the impact of this on
   improving healthcare service is also summarized in the current review.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Late Permian to early Triassic gabbro in North Lhasa, Tibet:
   evidence for plume - subduction-zone interaction of the Palaeo-Tethys
   ocean (Retracted article. See MAR, 2023)},
Journal = {GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Palaeo-Mesozoic geodynamic evolution of the Tangjia-Sumdo
   accretionary complex belt, which separates the North and South Lhasa
   Terrane, remains controversial. Moreover, the lack of geological records
   restricts the understanding of the evolution of the Sumdo Palaeo-Tethys
   Ocean from the middle Permian until the middle Triassic. Here we present
   zircon U-Pb geochronology, whole-rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic
   compositions of the Yeqing gabbro. Zircon U-Pb geochronology yields ages
   from 254 +/- 1 to 249 +/- 1 Ma. In situ Hf isotopic analyses yield
   epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -0.2 to +6.3. These samples have high TiO2
   (3.69 wt \%) and P2O5 (0.78 wt \%) contents, with typical patterns like
   ocean island basalt (OIB). Besides, they are classified as high-Nb
   basalts (HNBs) based on the high content of Nb (45.3-113.5 ppm).
   Whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic compositions are similar to OIB, with initial
   Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.7047-0.7054, Nd-143/Nd-144 of 0.512526-0.512647 and
   epsilon(Nd)(t) of 0.3-2.7. These signatures suggest that the Yeqing
   gabbro is mainly derived from low-degree melting of the garnet
   lherzolite mantle. Based on field observations of HNBs intruding into
   the continental margin and their geochemical characteristics, we infer
   that the Yeqing gabbro was generated in a subduction environment.
   Combined with the regional geology of the subduction environment and the
   evolution of oceanic islands in the Sumdo Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, we
   propose that the Yeqing gabbro may represent a product of the
   asthenosphere upwelling through a slab window produced by subduction of
   seismic ridge in the Sumdo Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, called plume -
   subduction-zone interaction, during the late Permian to early Triassic.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Predictors of sternal wound infection post cardiac surgery in

Abstract = {BackgroundSternal wound infection (SWI) post cardiac surgery remains an
   important cause of extra morbidity, mortality and cost. The objective
   was to identify risk factors for SWI in a cardiac centre in Eastern
   Saudi Arabia as part of the investigation into Surveillance variance in
   the local rates of SWI.MethodsWe included cases and controls from a
   cross section of patients who underwent major cardiac surgery between
   2017 and 2020 matched for age, sex and time of surgery. An explanatory
   logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the risk
   factors.ResultsN = 204 (51 cases and 153 controls matching ratio 1:3,
   from a source population of 985 patients). factors significantly
   associated with SWI in the final multivariate model: hospital stay OR
   (1.05, Cl 1.01-1.10), Graft Conduit BIMA versus No Graft OR (10.94, Cl
   1.60-74.63), transfusion of both packed cells plus other blood products
   versus no transfusion OR (3.53, Cl 93-13.44), HbA1c OR (1.09 Cl
   0.84-1.41), BMI OR (1.25, Cl 1.04-1.50), perioperative blood glucose OR
   (1.02, Cl 1.004-1.03), surgery time OR (1.19, Cl
   1.00-1.58).ConclusionsThe diverse aetiology, cross-disciplinary nature
   of SWI prevention, and despite improved prevention and control
   practices, including related care bundles with their proven value, SWI
   remain a serious challenge in cardiac surgery. Multidisciplinary
   consensus guidelines are well overdue.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Interrogating the traditional ethics and values of religious
   fundraising strategies of Ijo Orunmila Adulawo (Southwest Nigeria)
   (Retracted article. See JUN, 2023)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 14},
Abstract = {In the last three decades, traditional religious groups in Nigeria have
   continued to re-emerge and expand, despite their earlier inhibition by
   increased dominance of Christianity, Islam, and secular-modernist
   values. One such group is the Ijo Orunmila Adulawo (African Congregation
   of Orunmila Devotees), established in 1934 as an umbrella organisation
   for traditional worshippers. The group's growth has been facilitated by
   its `appropriation' of modes of practice associated with Pentecostal
   Christianity, although attempts are often made to distance itself from
   `foreign' ways of worship. This article discusses how the tensions
   produced by these dynamics have manifested in the group's financing
   strategies. Based on fieldwork in the Ikenne branch, I examine the
   innovative fundraising methods adopted since 1992 in the construction of
   a modern iledi (temple), and then the debates that they sparked among
   members, some of whom felt that such strategies reflected Christian,
   rather than traditional Yoruba ethics and values. The article
   contributes to our understanding of how economic practices are embedded
   in the broader politics of value negotiated by traditional religious
   groups like Ijo Orunmila as they seek to establish and maintain the
   authority and relevance that drives their formidability in contemporary
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Significant evidence does exist on the effectiveness of transdiagnostic
   interventions to improve emotional problems in clinical populations, and
   their application as universal and indicated prevention programs.
   However, no randomized controlled trials (RCT) studying selective
   transdiagnostic prevention intervention have been published. This is the
   first known RCT to evaluate the efficacy/effectiveness of an
   evidence-based selective prevention transdiagnostic program for
   emotional problems in adolescents. The impact of three different
   interventions was evaluated: (1) PROCARE (Preventive transdiagnostic
   intervention for Adolescents at Risk for Emotional disorders), which is
   a group-based, online-delivered, abbreviated version of the Unified
   Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in
   Adolescents (UP-A), along with adding a booster session, to reduce risk
   of onset of anxiety and depression, (2) PROCARE + , which includes the
   PROCARE protocol along with personalized add-on modules tailored to
   match adolescents' risk factors, and (3) an active control condition
   (ACC) based on emotional psychoeducation. In total, 286 adolescents
   (53.3\% girls) evidencing high risk and low protective factors were
   randomized and allocated to PROCARE, PROCARE + or ACC. Self- and
   parent-reported measures were taken at baseline, as well as after the
   intervention, a 6-month follow-up was carried out, together with a
   1-month follow-up after the booster session. Differences between
   conditions were significant on most of the outcome measures, with
   superior effect sizes for PROCARE +. Interventions were excellent in
   terms of acceptability, with good satisfaction rates. Tailored selective
   transdiagnostic interventions focused on mitigating risk factors and
   promoting protective factors in vulnerable adolescents are promising.},

Abstract = {Background Metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer have become a
   barrier to treating patients successfully. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
   are known as vital players in cancer development and progression.Methods
   The RT-qPCR were used to detect the gene expression. Colony formation
   assay, would healing assay, and transwell assay were performed to
   investigate oncogenic functions of cells. CCK8 assay was used to detect
   the cell viability. Western blot was applied to detect the protein
   level. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the
   relationship between molecules. Mouse orthotopic xenograft tumor models
   were established to evaluate the effects of BCAR4 on tumor growth and
   metastasis in vivo.Results LncRNA BCAR4 was significantly increased in
   breast cancer patients' tissues and plasma and upregulated in breast
   cancer cell lines. BCAR4 upregulation was correlated with the TNM stages
   and decreased after surgical removal of breast tumors. Silencing of
   BCAR4 suppressed breast cancer cell colony formation, migration,
   invasion, and xenograft tumor growth and promoted chemo-sensitivity.
   Mechanistically, BCAR4 facilitates breast cancer migration and invasion
   via the miR-644a-CCR7 axis of the MAPK pathway. BCAR4 promotes ABCB1
   expression indirectly by binding to and down-regulating miR-644a to
   induce chemo-resistance in breast cancer.Conclusions Our findings
   provide insights into the oncogenic role of BCAR4 and implicate BCAR4 as
   a potential diagnostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic agent to
   suppress metastasis and inhibit chemo-resistance of breast cancer.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Does China Pakistan Economic Corridor become an avenue to
   achieve sustainable development goal no. 2 (food security) in Pakistan:
   Under the condition of COVID-19? (Retracted article. See vol. 18, 2023)},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {The post Covid-19 era steer towards stakeholder thinking, which demands
   to look for sustainable solutions in terms of other epidemics and food
   security is one of the most notable for the developing world. In South
   Asia, China Pakistan Economic Corridor could be an avenue for
   multi-layered socio-economic assistance where Pakistan can seek solution
   for one epidemic (food security) while engaged with the effects of
   pandemic through studying all the stakeholders. This could be a roadmap
   for the west-east or developed-underdeveloped countries reliance on one
   another for food security through economic corridor alike settings.
   Academically, it has been projected by the plethora of research that
   holistically and inclusively, stakeholder analysis is lacking in the
   available reservoir of research. Methodologically, the stakeholder
   analysis was performed in three layers-identification, investigation
   through social networks, and communication by prioritization matrix. The
   findings suggested that apart from stakeholders' differences in regard
   to interest, influence and knowledge, all of them agreed with the
   argument that China Pakistan Economic Corridor has enviably and
   irrefutably positive effects on food security. The policy implications
   project the need for integrated reports of various ministries to be
   unidirectional for having synergical effect and taking all the
   stakeholders into consideration as leaving any group behind will repeat
   the past results.},

Abstract = {Purpose: This study aim to determine the occurrence of gestational
   diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancies after IVF treatment and to
   evaluate the factors that reduce this risk.Material and Methods: This
   retrospective cohort study was conducted using the medical records of
   pregnant women who conceived following IVF at the in-vitro fertilization
   center between 2002-2019. The data were obtained from medical records
   and phone interviews. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
   analyses were performed.Results: The incidence of GDM was found to be
   16.7\%. The regression model indicated that the risk of GDM was 4.57
   times higher in the age group 36-40 at conception during the IVF cycle
   than the age group 31-35 (95\% CI = 1.18-17.73, p = .028). Furthermore,
   women who conceived after the second IVF trial had a risk of GDM 3.464
   times higher than those that conceived after their first IVF trial (95\%
   CI = 1.07-11.23, p= .038). Conclusion: As age and number of IVF trials
   increase in infertile women, the risk of GDM increases after IVF
   treatment.},

Title = {RETRACTED: NELA Risk Calculator Significantly Underestimates Mortality
   Risk of Laparotomy for Mesenteric and Colonic Ischaemia in Older Adult

Abstract = {Aim: To establish if the NELA risk calculator underestimates mortality
   risk in older adults undergoing laparotomy for mesenteric or colonic
   ischaemia. Methods: A retrospective search of the operative database was
   performed for all patients over age 65 years who underwent laparotomy
   across two tertiary centres over a 3-year period. Cases of mesenteric or
   colonic ischaemia were identified from the operative records. Cases
   where ischaemia occurred secondarily to a primary obstructive or other
   pathology were excluded. Cases where a NELA score was not documented
   preoperatively were excluded. We then compared the NELA scores to the
   observed 30-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were hospital length
   of stay and intensive care unit length of stay. Results: Sixty cases
   were included in our analysis. There were 27 cases of colonic ischaemia
   and 33 cases of mesenteric ischaemia (mesenteric ischaemia group
   included five cases of distal small-bowel and colonic ischaemia). The
   overall mean NELA score was 21.9\%, while the actual 30-day mortality
   was 43.3\% (p=0.0094). Mean NELA score for mesenteric ischaemia cases
   only was 20.6\% with an actual mortality rate of 45.5\%. Mean NELA score
   for the colonic ischaemia cases was 23.5\% with an actual mortality rate
   of 40.7\%. The median time from operation to mortality was 8 days. Mean
   age was 77 years. Length of stay for survivors was a mean 27 days with
   intensive care unit length of stay of 9.3 days. Conclusion: The NELA
   risk score for mortality post-emergency laparotomy underestimates
   mortality risk by a factor of two in older adults where the primary
   pathology is mesenteric or colonic ischaemia.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Dynamic correlations of renewable-energy companies: Evidence
   from a multilayer network model (Retracted article. See vol. 15, 2023)},

Abstract = {Against the background of seeking to achieve carbon neutrality,
   relationships among renewable-energy companies around the world have
   become multiple and complex. In this work, the Pearson, Kendall, tail,
   and partial correlation coefficients were applied to 51 global
   companies-including solar and wind firms, independent power plants, and
   utilities-to explore the linear, nonlinear, extreme-risk, and direct
   relations between them. Sample data from 7 August 2015 to 6 August 2021
   were considered, and three sub-periods were extracted from these sample
   data by analysis of the evolution of multiple correlations combined with
   event analysis. A four-layer correlation network model was then
   constructed. The main results are as follows. (1) The multiple relations
   among the selected firms underwent dramatic changes during two external
   shocks (the China-US trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic). (2) The
   extreme-risk network layer verified that the trade war mainly affected
   the relationships among companies in the solar industries of China and
   the US. (3) During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the linear and direct
   relationships among wind firms from Canada, Spain, and Germany were
   significantly increased. In this sub-period, edge-weight distributions
   of the four different layers were heterogeneous and varied from
   power-law features to Gaussian distributions. (4) During all the
   sub-periods, most companies had similar numbers of neighbors, while the
   numbers of neighbors of a few companies varied greatly in the four
   different layers. These findings provide a useful reference for
   stakeholders and may help them understand the connectedness and
   evolution of global renewable-energy markets.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To detect the effect of the Schroth method added to the
   Gensingen brace for six months on Cobb's angle, axial rota-tion of the
   trunk, and pulmonary function in ado-lescent idiopathic
   scoliosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study fol-lowed a prospective,
   single-blinded, random-ized controlled trial design following the
   CON-SORT guidelines. The study was conducted in Health and
   Rehabilitation Centre. 42 males aged 10-18 years old, diagnosed with
   adolescent id-iopathic scoliosis (AIS) with curves of 35-40 degrees,
   were recruited and then were allocated into three groups: Group A, Group
   B, and Group C.RESULTS: Significant improvement (p < 0.001) in Cobb's
   angle and the axial rotation of the trunk (ART) were noted after the
   treatment in the three groups, while pulmonary function showed better
   results in Group A (p < 0.001) when com-pared to the two other groups p
   >= 0.000).CONCLUSIONS: Six months of Schroth meth-od added to Gensingen
   Brace demonstrate fa-vorable results in Cobb's angle, thoracic trunk
   rotation angle, and pulmonary function in ado-lescent idiopathic
   scoliosis.},
