Abstract = {BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important regulatory role in
   carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Aberrant expression of miR-497-5p
   has been reported in various human malignancies. However, the role of
   miR-497-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.ResultsIn
   this study, we found that miR-497-5p was downregulated in HCC tissues.
   The low level of miR-497-5p in HCC tumors was correlated with aggressive
   clinicopathological characteristics and predicted poor prognosis in HCC
   patients. The overexpression of miR-497-5p significantly inhibited HCC
   cell proliferation, colony formation, and metastasis in vitro and vivo.
   Bioinformatics analysis further identified insulin-like growth factor 1
   (IGF1) as a novel target of miR-497-5p in HCC cells.ConclusionOur study
   suggested that miR-497-5p regulates HCC cell survival, partially through
   downregulation of IGF1. Therefore, the miR-497-5p/IGF1 axis might serve
   as a novel therapeutic target in patients with HCC.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Investigation on fluidity, microstructure, mechanical and
   durability properties of snail shell based graphene oxide cement
   composite material (Retracted article. See vol. 380, 2023)},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {362},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a more usage of Graphene Oxide
   nanomaterial to enhance the desirable qualities of cement-based
   composites. The fluidity of cement composites and the workability of
   concrete, on the other hand, may be lowered as a result of the
   introduction of graphene oxide (GO). In this research, a simple and
   inexpensive additive snail shell powder was employed to increase the
   fluidity of graphene oxide cement com-posites. Additionally, the
   microstructure, mechanized, and durableness performance of snail shell
   (SS) based graphene oxide (GO) cement composites was studied.
   Snail-Shells are examples of bio-shell debris that is wasted from
   restaurants and the seas every day. Because of poor maintenance of
   waste, SS are deposited as rubbish on vacant areas and in landfills. The
   snail shell powder has a spherical shape and has a pozzolanic character,
   similar to that found in cement. In the current study, snail shell
   powder was employed in GO-cement composites to substitute a portion of
   the cement, and the performance of the composite material's fluidity,
   microstructure, mechanical, and durability characteristics were
   investigated. The impact of snail shell powder was investigated at 10
   wt\%, 15 wt\%, and 20 wt\%, replacement of cement, with graphene oxide
   (GO) addition ranging from ``0.01 wt\%, 0.02 wt\%, 0.03 wt\%, and 0.04
   wt\%{''}. The amount of snail shell powder added to the GO composite
   enhanced the fluidity. A result of the reduced water requirement, the
   spherical form of the snail shell powder (SSP) and the pozzolanic nature
   of the SSP, the improved fluidity of the GO-cement composite was
   obtained. The SEM examination were used to establish the micro
   structural study of the cement composite. In the SEM pictures, it could
   be shown that the combination of SS and GO changed the nature of
   structure of the composite from one that was porous to one that was
   significantly pore filled, resulting in better mechanical and durability
   charac-teristics. At 3, 7, and 28 days of curing, snail shell based
   GO-cement composites demonstrated stronger compressive and flexural
   strengths than the control sample, despite the fact that the snail shell
   powder dose was less than 20 \% of the total weight of the cement.
   Finally, the inclusion of snail shell powder material to the GO -cement
   composite resulted in an excellent solution to the fluidity issue that
   had been encountered.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Deacetyl epoxyazadiradione protects aminoglycoside
   antibiotic-induced renal cell apoptosis, in vitro (Retracted article.
   See MAR, 2023)},

Abstract = {Aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin are used frequently to
   treat bacterial infections in humans. Excessive consumption of these
   antibiotics lead to renal dysfunction. One of the factors contributing
   to renal dysfunction is oxidative damage, which causes apoptosis. Hence,
   this study investigates the effect of the antioxidant compound deacetyl
   epoxyazadiradione (DEA) in reducing cell death induced by gentamicin
   treatment in kidney cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells). The
   antioxidant experiments showed that reactive oxygen species level is
   decreased up to 27.06 +/- 0.18\% in 150 mu M of DEA treatment. At this
   concentration, the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide
   dismutase increased from 0.4 +/- 0.04 to 1.46 +/- 0.05 mu mol/min/L and
   catalase increased from 7.48 +/- 0.39 to 17.6 +/- 0.74 U/mg. The
   relative folds of gene expression of mitochondrial enzymes such as GST,
   GPx and GR restored from 0.596 +/- 0.019, 0.521 +/- 0.013 and 0.775 +/-
   0.014 to 0.866 +/- 0.013, 0.669 +/- 0.015 and 0.8615 +/- 0.028,
   respectively. Consequently, the percentage of cell viability increases
   upto 91.8 +/- 2.01 from 61.93 +/- 1.63 with much less fragmentation in
   genomic DNA. Additionally, molecular docking results showed that DEA
   could bind to Bax, Bcl- 2, Caspase- 3 and Caspase- 9 proteins. These
   results indicate that DEA could reduce cell apoptosis by reducing
   oxidative stress due to antibiotics and interrupting the apoptotic
   signal pathway in kidney cells.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Effect of Sham Acupuncture on Chronic Pain: A Bayesian
   Network Meta-Analysis (Retracted article. See FEB, 2023)},

Abstract = {Background Along with increasing research on acupuncture for chronic
   pain, the validity of sham acupuncture (SA) has also been argued.
   Methods Nine databases were searched for randomized controlled trials
   (RCTs) from the inception dates of the databases to July 5, 2022. With
   Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a Bayesian multiple-treatment network
   meta-analysis (NMA) with random-effects model was conducted. Results A
   total of 62 RCTs with 6,806 patients and four kinds of treatments (real
   acupuncture {[}RA], non-acupuncture {[}NA], penetrative SA {[}PSA], and
   non-penetrative SA {[}NPSA]) were included. The results indicated that
   both NPSA and PSA were not superior to NA in improving chronic pain
   (NPSA: mean difference {[}MD]= -4.77, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   -11.09 to 1.52; PSA: MD= -4.96, 95\% CI -10.38 to 0.48). After NPSA and
   PSA were combined into the SA group, the weak trend of pain relief from
   SA was still not statistically significant (MD= -4.91, 95\% CI -9.93 to
   0.05). NPSA and PSA had similar effects (MD= 0.18, 95\% CI -5.45 to
   5.81). RA was significantly associated with pain relief, compared with
   NPSA and PSA (NPSA: MD= -12.03, 95\% CI -16.62 to -7.41; PSA: MD=
   -11.85, 95\% CI -15.48 to -8.23). The results were generally consistent
   regardless of pain phenotype, frequency, duration, acupuncture methods,
   analgesic intake, or detection bias. Conclusion These results suggested
   that acupuncture was significantly associated with reduced chronic pain.
   The two kinds of placebo acupuncture, NPSA and PSA, have similar
   effects. Both NPSA and PSA, with a weak but not significant effect, are
   appropriate to be inert placebo controls in RCTs for chronic pain.},

Abstract = {Classification is a technique in data mining that is used to predict the
   value of a categorical variable and to produce input data and datasets
   of varying values. The classification algorithm makes use of the
   training datasets to build a model which can be used for allocating
   unclassified records to a defined class. In this paper, the coronavirus
   herd immunity optimizer (CHIO) algorithm is used to boost the efficiency
   of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) when solving classification
   problems. First, the PNN produces a random initial solution and submits
   it to the CHIO, which then attempts to refine the PNN weights. This is
   accomplished by the management of random phases and the effective
   identification of a search space that can probably decide the optimal
   value. The proposed CHIO-PNN approach was applied to 11 benchmark
   datasets to assess its classification accuracy, and its results were
   compared with those of the PNN and three methods in the literature, the
   firefly algorithm, African buffalo algorithm, and beta-hill climbing.
   The results showed that the CHIO-PNN achieved an overall classification
   rate of 90.3\% on all datasets, at a faster convergence speed as
   compared outperforming all the methods in the literature.},

Abstract = {The influence of CO2 on the corrosion characteristics of 42CrMo steel
   through heat treatment was systematically investigated. The results
   revealed that 42CrMo steel had a widmanstatten structure before heat
   treatment, and the Fe3C in the steel was laminar. However, it exhibited
   a granular bainite structure after heat treatment, and the Fe3C was
   granular. The corrosion rate of 42CrMo steel increased after heat
   treatment. The corrosion film of 42CrMo steel after heat treatment
   occurred severe spallation, and the protective properties of corrosion
   film were reduced. The lamellar Fe3C inhibited the local flow of Fe2+
   and had a better anchoring effect on corrosion products, resulting in
   the formation of a compact Cr-rich corrosion film. The granular Fe3C
   promoted the spallation of corrosion products, resulting in the
   formation of a porous corrosion film with no Cr-enrichment. Therefore,
   the heat treatment reduced the CO2 corrosion resistance of 42CrMo steel.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how perceptions of radicalisation and
   co-occurring mental health issues differ between mental health care and
   the security domain, and how these perceptions affect intersectoral
   collaboration. It is generally thought that intersectoral collaboration
   is a useful strategy for preventing radicalisation and terrorism,
   especially when it concerns radicalised persons with mental health
   issues. It is not clear, however, what perceptions professionals have of
   radicalisation and collaboration with other disciplines. Data was
   obtained from focus groups and individual interviews with practitioners
   and trainers from mental health care and the security domain in the
   Netherlands. The results show a lack of knowledge about radicalisation
   in mental health care, whereas in the security domain, there is little
   understanding of mental health issues. This leads to a mad-bad dichotomy
   which has a negative effect on collaboration and risk management.
   Improvement of the intersectoral collaboration by cross-domain
   familiarization, and strengthening of trust and mutual understanding,
   should begin with the basic training of professionals in both domains.
   The Care and Safety Houses in the Netherlands offer a sound base for
   intersectoral collaboration. Future professionals from different domains
   ought to be familiarized with each other's possibilities, limitations,
   tasks, and roles.},

Abstract = {Polytetrafluoroethylene has many excellent properties and a wide range
   of applications, but its poor wear resistance, hardness, and creep
   resistance have severely limited the use of the polytetrafluoroethylene
   composites. In this work, the surface of carbon fibers was treated with
   silane coupling agent acetone solution, and then sintering technology
   was used to prepare carbon fibers/polyetheretherketone (PEEK)/
   polytetrafluoroethylene composites. The mechanical and frictional wear
   properties of the composites were analyzed using an electronic tensile
   tester, a Shore hardness tester, and a frictional wear tester, and
   scanning electron microscopy was applied to analyze the surface
   morphology of the composites after wear. The experimental results shown
   that the addition of carbon fibers could significantly improve the
   mechanical properties of the composites, reduce the radial shrinkage,
   and increase the Shore hardness of the composites. Under the same
   experimental conditions, the carbon fibers (20 wt.\%)
   /polyetheretherketone/polytetrafluoroethylene composites has the best
   wear resistance, with a friction coefficient of 0.196 and the wear rate
   of 2.41 x 10(-6) mm(3)/N center dot m. In the theoretical simulation,
   the thermal conductivity of polytetrafluoroethylene composites was
   predicted using ANSYS software, with the changes in the temperature and
   friction force in the friction process. The theoretical simulation
   results matched with the experimental values, which proved the accuracy
   of the theoretical simulations.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in December
   2019 in Wuhan, China, and then moved to almost every country showing an
   unprecedented outbreak. The world health organization declared COVID-19
   a pandemic. Since then, millions of people were infected, and millions
   have lost their lives all around the globe. By the end of 2020,
   effective vaccines that could prevent the fast spread of the disease
   started to loom on the horizon. Nevertheless, isolation, social
   distancing, face masks, and quarantine are the best-known measures, in
   the time being, to fight the pandemic. On the other hand, contact
   tracing is an effective procedure in tracking infections and saving
   others' lives. In this paper, we devise a new approach using a hybrid
   harmony search (HHS) algorithm that casts the problem of finding
   strongly connected components (SCCs) to contact tracing. This new
   approach is named as hybrid harmony search contact tracing (HHS-CT)
   algorithm. The hybridization is achieved by integrating the stochastic
   hill climbing into the operators' design of the harmony search
   algorithm. The HHS-CT algorithm is compared to other existing algorithms
   of finding SCCs in directed graphs, where it showed its superiority over
   these algorithms. The devised approach provides a 77.18\% enhancement in
   terms of run time and an exceptional average error rate of 1.7\%
   compared to the other existing algorithms of finding SCCs.},

Abstract = {To offer better treatment for a COVID-19 patient, preferable medicine
   selection has become a challenging task for most of the medical
   practitioners as there is no such proven information regarding it. This
   article proposes a decision-making approach for preferable medicine
   selection using picture fuzzy set (PFS), Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of
   evidence and grey relational analysis (GRA). PFS is an extended version
   of the intuitionistic fuzzy set, where in addition to membership and
   non-membership grade, neutral and refusal membership grades are used to
   solve uncertain real-life problems more efficiently. Hence, we attempt
   to use it in this article to solve the mentioned problem. Previously,
   researchers considered the neutral membership grade of the PFS similar
   to the other two membership values (positive and negative) as applied to
   the decision-making method. In this study, we explore that neutral
   membership grade can be associated with probabilistic uncertainty which
   is measured using D-S theory of evidence and FUSH operation is applied
   for the aggregation purpose. Then GRA is used to measure the performance
   among the set of parameters which are in conflict and contradiction with
   each other. In this process, we propose an alternative group
   decision-making approach by the evidence of the neutral membership grade
   which is measured by the D-S theory and the conflict and contradiction
   among the criteria are managed by GRA. Finally, the proposed approach is
   demonstrated to solve the COVID-19 medicine selection problem.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Evolving deep convolutional neutral network by hybrid

Abstract = {The COVID19 pandemic globally and significantly has affected the life
   and health of many communities. The early detection of infected patients
   is effective in fighting COVID19. Using radiology (X-Ray) images is,
   perhaps, the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Thereby, deep
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be considered as applicable
   tools to diagnose COVID19 positive cases. Due to the complicated
   architecture of a deep CNN, its real-time training and testing become a
   challenging problem. This paper proposes using the Extreme Learning
   Machine (ELM) instead of the last fully connected layer to address this
   deficiency. However, the parameters' stochastic tuning of ELM's
   supervised section causes the final model unreliability. Therefore, to
   cope with this problem and maintain network reliability, the sine-cosine
   algorithm was utilized to tune the ELM's parameters. The designed
   network is then benchmarked on the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, and the
   results are verified by a comparative study with canonical deep CNN, ELM
   optimized by cuckoo search, ELM optimized by genetic algorithm, and ELM
   optimized by whale optimization algorithm. The proposed approach
   outperforms comparative benchmarks with a final accuracy of 98.83\% on
   the COVID-Xray-5k dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of
   2.33\% compared to a canonical deep CNN. Even more critical, the
   designed network's training time is only 0.9421 ms and the overall
   detection test time for 3100 images is 2.721 s.},

Abstract = {Management of an institution determines its success or failure.
   Educational management and administration borrow the characteristics of
   business model with reference to the operations of higher education
   institutions. Managerial skills in this regard for campus sustainability
   are of great significance. However, there is a lack of study that
   comprehensively explores these skills. This study aimed at exploring the
   managerial skills to promote campus sustainability at Pakistan Public
   Universities (PPUs). The qualitative case study research design was
   employed to gain a deeper understanding of middle managers from PPUs.
   Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis of documents were used
   to gather the data. Results found three types of managerial skills:
   technical skills, interpersonal skills and training and development.
   Challenges were found to create hurdles to improve these skills. Being
   the first qualitative study in Pakistan perspectives, the findings
   cannot be generalized but can be transferable to other public
   universities in Pakistan.},

Abstract = {In work-from-home (WFH) situation due to coronavirus (COVID-19)
   pandemic, the handheld device (HHD) users work in awkward postures for
   longer hours because of unavailability of ergonomically designed
   workstations. This problem results in different type of musculoskeletal
   disorders (MSDs) among the HHD users. An integrated multi-criteria
   decision-making approach was offered for identifying the risk level of
   MSDs among HHD users. A case example implemented the proposed approach
   in which, firstly, the best-worst method (BWM) technique was used to
   prioritize and determine the relative importance (weightage) of the risk
   factors. The weightages of the risk factors further used to rank the
   seven alternatives (HHD users) using Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija
   Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) technique. The outcomes of the BWM
   investigation showed that the three most significant risk factors
   responsible for MSDs are duration of working, poor working posture and
   un-ergonomic design. The outcome of the VIKOR technique exhibited that
   computer professionals were at the highest risk among all users. The
   risk factor priority must be used for designing a working strategy for
   the WFH situation which will help to mitigate the risks of MSDs.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a destructive effect on the
   health and well-being of the global population. A vital step in the
   battle against it is the successful screening of infected patients,
   together with one of the effective screening methods being radiology
   examination using chest radiography. Recognition of epidemic growth
   patterns across temporal and social factors can improve our capability
   to create epidemic transmission designs, including the critical job of
   predicting the estimated intensity of the outbreak morbidity or
   mortality impact at the end. The study's primary motivation is to be
   able to estimate with a certain level of accuracy the number of deaths
   due to COVID-19, managing to model the progression of the pandemic.
   Predicting the number of possible deaths from COVID-19 can provide
   governments and decision-makers with indicators for purchasing
   respirators and pandemic prevention policies. Thus, this work presents
   itself as an essential contribution to combating the pandemic. Kalman
   Filter is a widely used method for tracking and navigation and filtering
   and time series. Designing and tuning machine learning methods are a
   labor- and time-intensive task that requires extensive experience. The
   field of automated machine learning Auto Machine Learning relies on
   automating this task. Auto Machine Learning tools enable novice users to
   create useful machine learning units, while experts can use them to free
   up valuable time for other tasks. This paper presents an objective
   method of forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak using Kalman Filter and Auto
   Machine Learning. We use a COVID-19 dataset of Ceara, one of the 27
   federative units in Brazil. Ceara has more than 235,222 confirmed cases
   of COVID-19 and 8850 deaths due to the disease. The TPOT automobile
   model showed the best result with a 0.99 of

   However, in many areas, the demand for data mining technology is urgent,
   such as network finance, industry, municipal public management, and
   communications engineering. The important research topics of data mining
   technology include cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is to sort out
   irregular data. The key to the research of data clustering is clustering
   algorithms. This article will elaborate on the data mining technology
   and the process of cluster analysis based on layered mining for the
   ubiquitous clouds and social Internet of Things. The proposed model will

Title = {RETRACTED: Assessment of Intraoperative Flow Measurement as a Quality

Abstract = {Background:
   To evaluate the technical results of the arterial repair, a variety of
   intraoperative imaging and assessment techniques can be used during
   carotid endarterectomy. The aim of the study was to evaluate the
   usefulness of intraoperative ultrasound flow measurement as a quality
   control after primary carotid endarterectomy in the setting of a
   teaching hospital.
   Methods:
   One hundred and seven consecutive carotid endarterectomies were
   performed over 24 months at our institution. Retrospectively acquired
   demographics, intraoperative flow measurements, duplex results,
   revisions, and surgical outcomes were reviewed. Postoperative 30-day
   transient ischemic attack, stroke, and death rates were analyzed.
   Results were compared with ultrasound flow measurement and duplex
   ultrasonography.
   Results:
   From March 2013 to March 2015, 107 primary consecutive carotid
   endarterectomies were performed in 107 patients (71\% male, 29\%
   female). The age ranged from 51 to 81 years with a mean age of 68 +/- 4
   years. Associated risk factors included diabetes 89 (83\%), smoking 92
   (86\%), hypertension 94 (87.8\%), chronic renal insufficiency 71 (66\%),
   and coronary artery disease 57 (53\%). Early postoperative duplex scans
   in all 107 patients showed no significant changes from intraoperative
   findings. The ipsilateral stroke and death rate in this study was 0
   (0/107) and 30-day death and stroke rate was also 0 (0/107), with no
   significant difference between trainees and senior surgeons. Three
   patients (2.8 \%) had flow Conclusion:
   The findings of this study indicate that the intraoperative flow
   measurement is an alternative method for detecting technical errors and
   a tool for quality control imaging. Especially for the trainees, it
   makes sense to ensure effectiveness of the procedure upon its completion
   and to assess the technical adequacy of carotid endarterectomy.},

Abstract = {SYNOPSIS Objective. Parental self-critical perfectionism has been
   identified as an important source of parents' psychologically
   controlling parenting. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how this
   well-established association can be explained. This study aims to
   advance insight in the association between parental self-critical
   perfectionism and psychological control by addressing the role of
   parental reflective functioning among parents of adolescents. Design.
   This cross-sectional study included 268 adolescents (M-age = 15.14
   years, 50.7\% female), mothers (M-age = 45.83 years), and fathers (M-age
   = 47.77 years). Parents completed questionnaires assessing self-critical
   perfectionism, parental reflective functioning, psychologically
   controlling parenting, and their child's problem behaviors. In addition,
   adolescents rated their parents' use of psychological control. Results.
   Self-critical perfectionism related both directly and indirectly, via
   parents' pre-mentalization, to psychological control among mothers and
   fathers. Most associations remained significant when controlling for
   adolescent problem behaviors. Conclusions. This incapacity to reflect on
   the adolescent's mental world, and the tendency to make maladaptive
   attributions about the adolescent's internal states, make parents with
   high levels of self-critical perfectionism vulnerable to rely on
   psychologically controlling parenting.},

Abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory,
   demyelinating, and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous
   system (CNS) that is immunologically mediated in genetically susceptible
   individuals. Interleukin-16 (IL-16), a pleiotropic cytokine, is an
   important regulator of T-cell activation which plays a key role in
   autoimmune diseases. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-16
   gene may lead to altered cytokine expression or biological activity, and
   these variations may modulate an individual's risk for MS. To test this
   hypothesis, we investigated association of IL-16 gene SNPs (i.e.,
   rs4072111 C/T, rs11556218 G/T, and rs4778889 C/T) and serum IL-16 levels
   with risk of MS in an Iranian population.
   Methods: We analyzed the three SNPs of IL-16 in 250 MS patients and 400
   healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The serum level of IL-16 was assessed by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: The IL-16 rs4072111C/T genotype and allele frequencies showed
   significantly differences between MS patients and controls (p < 0.01).
   Statistically significant differences were also found in allele and
   genotype frequencies of rs11556218 G/T between two groups (p = 0.01).
   The mean serum levels of IL-16 in MS patients were significantly higher
   in MS patients compared to healthy controls (p <= 0.01).
   Conclusion: In summary, the present study provides the first evidence
   that the rs11556218T/G and rs4072111C/T polymorphisms of IL-16 gene were
   significantly associated with increased risk of MS. These results
   suggest that rs11556218T/G, rs4072111C/T, and rs4778889T/C polymorphisms
   of IL-16 may contribute to susceptibility to MS through increased
   expression of IL-16 levels.},
